If you can find a Muslim who is really worried about it-----please take the bombs off his vest, sit him down, and you guys can talk about Santa.\n\nIf you can find a Hebrew person who is concerned about Santa, then ask him to put down his Torah, and sit down and talk to him about it.\n\nIf you can find a Buddhist who is concerned about Santa, then you can certainly Hmmmmmmmmmm your way into a conversation.\n\nIf you can find an atheist who is concerned about Santa, then they would have to believe in a giving, loving, spirit.

Our belief of Good and Evil has existed but not in the sense of putting them into human form...It also has to do with nature and everything in it and man having supreme dominion. With survival of the Fittest...Although their were Shamans that practiced the dark arts to control villages to gain wealth. The Good Shamans practiced healing using the natural plants and chants which were passed down and learned by the tribes. This is a dying art but still shared through the family lineages. I still know my family lineage song and passing it down to my relatives. This is our way...The only other thing I can bring up on the subject is we knew of a creator who was good, then there had to be something evil...It is the law of nature. Me I would like to spend my eternity with my tribe when things were serene before the coming of the white race, who seems to bring nothing but distruction in its path. and destroying the ecosystem of our precious homeland...but a calm serene world with our way of life and one with NATURE.....The evil shamans that once ruled certain villages along the northern coast of Alaska at one time controlled over 8,000 Inuit and amassed wealth and showed no respect. They were eventually killed off when the first Europeons brought Alcohol...When they passed out, the people in fear would butcher the shaman and spread his body so that he could not come back to the village using their magic spells they practiced."

And every so often they change and adapt things in this theory when some scientific fact or discovery comes along and begins to expose it. People did not come from monkeys. A piece or two pieces of nothing did not explode and create everything. And evolution disproves itself. It teaches that the strongest species survives. So if that is so why is man still here? Man isn't the strongest species, but he does think. But the original theories say the strongest not the one that can think. So as I said it disproves itself. So now the only logical and factual explanation for existence is GOD!!!"

God chose the Jews to be His people. He wanted to be their king and the law was their constitution, so to speak. The only true theocracy in history! Later, the people asked for an earthly king but the law remained and is still a part of God's covenant with the Jewish people today.\nwhen Jesus came, He observed the law and even more, He fulfilled it. Does that mean it is no longer valid? \nNo, it's still valid. But it's still a covenant between God and the Jewish people. \nWhen the gospel was first preached to Gentiles, some Jewish believers taught, that all Gentiles have to become circumcised and follow the Mosaic law if they want to be followers of Christ.\nThe whole matter is discussed extensively in Acts 15. In the end, the apostles agreed, that Gentiles should not be subject to the law, but that they should be given the following guidelines: abstain from blood, from animals that have been strangled or sacrificed to idols and from sexual immorality. So why do Christians not follow these rules? Because they were not given as a law by God but rather as guidelines by the apostles. \nSo, yes the mosaic law still stands but Gentiles are not required to keep it."

"1","What was the actual SIN of Sodom & Gamorrah?","Most theist, especially those claiming to be ""christian,"" claim that is was homosexuality when in fact ""homosexuality"" is not even mentioned anywhere in the Genesis 13 account  As a matter of fact, you can read the sin of Sodom in Ezekiel:\n\n "" `Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were ARROGANT, OVEFED and UNCONCERNED; they DID NOT HELP the POOR and NEEDY.  EZE 16:49\n\nIt appears that the people became self indulgent and did not care for the needs of others.  Sounds a lot like most of us in this modern era.  Thank God that Jesus was sent for our redemption.","I think first off you have a wrong idea of what sin is, and so your question becomes difficult to answer.  \n\nSin is often thought of by modern day people as an act that one does that God does not approve of.  This is a fine definition in some respects, however when one begins to speak of God, this definition is hardly adequate, because it leaves open the possibility of one being able not to sin, which scripture clearly teaches against.  Sin could better be defined, (as it was in the ancient church) as separation from God, or even as a loss of the ""image of God"" which was bestowed upon Adam and Eve at their creation.  When one thinks of sin in those terms there is not a specific sin that caused God to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, instead there is a lack of faith, or realtionship with God.  This faith, or Relationship comes from the promise of God given to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:15-16, that One will come from Eve's womb whom Satan will pierce but who will crush Satan's head.  Only when God works through that means can one have faith, which none had in Sodom and Gomorrah.  Further more, when one looks at the book of Matthew (25:40ff) one understands what Ezekiel was saying.  With out faith, one cannot do good works to serve their neighbor.  However at the time when God puts Himself into relationship with man, everything that they do is a good work, and consequently, in their faith relationship they are not arrogant, overfed, unconcerned, and they help the poor and needy.  \n\nIn the end you are right with your last statement in the question: ""It appears that the people became self indulgent and did not care for the needs of others. Sounds a lot like most of us in this modern era. Thank God that Jesus was sent for our redemption."""

I feel that any religion that has to push itself onto people to prove themselves to be right should look at 2 non-evangelical religions for evidence that it is not neccessary: they are the Jewish faiths and true Islam (not the militant fanaticism).  They have out grown Christianity as the largest practices religions.  However the oldest is that of the Pagan sects.  It has continued to flourish and grow in spite of oppressive evangelical religions.  Why? because we keep to ourselves and just practicing being the best we can in our daily lives.  Realizing that we must be good to ourselves before we can do good for others, and without religious overtones.  That is true good works, when it is done because it needs to be and not in the name of a religion."

If they do send you stuff just asked to be removed from their lists. You may have friends from church - if they respect you and are open to other ideas they will remain your friends now that you have left. If they don't they clearly weren't worth the effort anyway. \n\nGo out, see the world, experience the world for what it is rather than through the dark glasses that religion forces upon you.

"1","What is ""Hyphey"" ?","I am hearing all these punk kids in the mall that are wearing giant t-shirts that go to their ankles and sideways hats talk about ""getting hyphey"" and ""listening to hyphey"".  what the heck is hyphey?","Hyphey is its own branch of hip-hop/rap/whatever you want to call it, that has its roots in the San Francisco/Bay area.  It was a sort of backlash against all the gangster rap, and the negativity and violence that went along with that.  Hyphey is its own culture, with its own music, and its own terminology.  There are some odd seeming rituals, such as ""ghosting,"" where people all get out of a car, and let it idle slowly down the street, while they walk along side--it looks as no one is driving the car because no one is--or its being driven by a ghost.  The culture has a lot to do with partying, love, support of friendships, bonds, and seeking a high or euphoria not so much from alcohol or drug use (but that is still quite part of it,) but more from the experience itself.  It really is in many ways, sort of a very modern, rap-like resurrection of the hippy life-style, or at least those ideals.  There are some excellent articles on the internet if you are a reader.  Sorry I don't have the links saved, but they come up easily under searches."

We were at it for about a half an hour and she was really getting in and massaging my sore muscles very deep.  I was kind of moaning with the pain and then she asked me if I wanted a ""happy ending"".  I didn't know what she was talking about and so I said no. Now that question is really bugging me. What is that supposed to mean?  Should I say something to her or the pastor?","Very nice story."
"1","How and why do paedophiles get jobs such as Teachers, Priests and Boyscout Leaders?","Is it me or do all paedophiles reported in the News come from proffsions with close links to kids, especially thechurch which seems to be an haven for kiddy fiddlers and other such vocations as boyscout leaders, teachers and care workers, why are tests on their personality never undertaken and why as the church never done anything about all the sexual deviants hiding under it's wing?","Paedophiles are attracted to jobs that will give them easy access to children.  \n\nI don't at all agree with you when you say that ""little is being done"" about this problem.  In education, for example, anyone who wants to work in a school must undertake a criminal background check.  The problem is with people who are paedophiles, or potential paedophiles but who have no criminal record.  There is also a problem with people who have been suspected but never convicted, in a legal system that has a presumption of innocence until guilt is proven.  I notice that you are from Cheshire and so you will be very aware of the case of Ian Huntley, which was a tragic illustration of the great difficulties that exist in this area."

"1","For Christians only, is going to heaven the same as inheriting the kingdom of God?","1 Cor 6:9 says that the unrighteous (ie unbelievers) will not inherit the kingdom of God.  The unrighteous cannot inherit because they are not sons of God which believers are.\nGal 5:19-21 says that those who do the works of the flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God.  Here believers who sin (ie engaged in the works of the flesh)\ncannot inherit the kingdom of God.  Believers who are sons of God are disqualified from their inheritance because of sins.\nIn Rom 14:17  Apostle Paul defines the kingdom of God to be righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\nA believer who sins is not disqualified from going to heaven but he would not inherit the kingdom of God in the sense that he will not enjoy righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.  I have consistently used the writings of Paul\nto come to this conclusion.  Any helpful comments, brothers and sisters in the Lord ?","Yes indeed.I was studying these issues myself.Here's my conviction.Justification is only by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and it is once and for all.Let God be true and man a liar.The transaction is done once and for all.The seal is done and no one can steal it from Christ.However,if you read the book of Revelation along with Daniel you will see that in the white throne judgement the believers in Christ and those who have rejected Christ will be separated by Christ himself like sheep is separated from goats.Which is a very sad thing and that is the reason why we Christians are supposed to be the salt of  the earth and light.So we (The believers in Christ )escape the final judgement.But all is not over.Now starts the judgement of the believers---do we enter heaven with honour or in dishonour?That is question we all need to ask now.Imagine living the rest of our lives in dishonour.Do we have any crowns to lay at His feet as our worship in eternity or not ,or shall we go empty handed standing before the Lord,with our heads hanging in shame???That is why Paul refers our life on earth like that of an athelete---breasting the tape alone will not determine our award but whether we are following the rules applicable;if an athelete does not follow rules of the race then imagine after running the race and comming 1st only to be told publicly he is disqualified for the award.That is very sad indeed!!!There are many more illustrations from every day life given in the Bible from which we all can understand simply.I believe God did not give His Word to us to keep it as a secret,his love for mankind was made a public spectacle when Christ gave his life on the cross willingly (and yet the world rejects it so much tragecally!!)so that you and I and all those who believe may not perish but have everlasting life.We are now co-heirs with Christ, therefore we inherit the Kingdom of heaven, not because of our deeds but by the act of Christ on the Cross.He gave us the authority to His children therefore we will live with him in heaven after our life on earth is over.Capture the image of the scene of the rupture!!!Oh! Death where is your sting!!!It is so powerful.He loves people His creation that he does not want even one to perish but it is we who reject His salvation for mankind.Jesus is a thorough gentleman, he never forces His way into anyone's life.His love is for the asking only.His heart is to preserve. I love The Word of God because it is so alive and speaking to me even in this decade.I also trust that  even as you seek the many question if you seek with all your heart He shall reveal it and The Truth shall set you free indeed.So the bottom line is whether we will enter heaven in honour or in shame?Amen."

I'm having a difficult time understanding the difference between the different accents in England before the Norman conquest and the different dialects in England after the Norman conquest.  Could someone help explain the difference between accents and dialects?  My dictionary only says that accents are different styles of pronunciation and dialects are different forms of pronunciation... and this still leaves me confused.","Yes, I can see why you would be confused by your dictionary's definition on this topic.\n\nAccent refers to the sounds that are present in a person's language.  Pronunciation is basically a synonym of accent.  Therefore, if I pronounce differently from someone, I have a different accent.\n\nDialect is something greater.  A dialect is a version of a language that is special to a particular region or group.  Dialects of the same language are different from each other, but still understandable to speakers of another dialect of that language.  For example, American English and British English are two dialects of English.  They have some differences, such as in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but they are still understandable to each other.\n\nIn your specific question, then, differences between dialects includes more than just differences in pronunciation.  I suppose that the reason your dictionary isn't precise on this is that accent(pronunciation) is often a pretty noticeable feature of dialect.  In other words, if I am interacting with a speaker of another dialect of my language, I will probably notice it first because of the differences in accent."

Have you begun searching for your creator yet? When you begin to connect with the divine, the apparent woes of this world begin to diminish. Hardship doesn't necessarily go away, but attachment to and belief in its power to crush you does. Sorrow and pain don't automatically vanish, but it begins to make sense--and in this process of making sense, sorrow and pain do tend to relent and lift.\n\nI hope--if you haven't already--that you seek God and cry out to him for help and his mercy. I can tell you from personal experience that this will make a difference, if you continue to seek with an open mind and heart, and in earnestness and humility.\n\nBest to you."

She was arrested because she would not give the officer her name or any other information about her.  In this instance the officer had no choice but to take her to jail.\nI asked this here and in law enforcement to see what different answers I get.  \nMy opinion is that a lot of people that hate cops bring it on themselves.","Cops are not always the bad guys.  Just like in any profession there are those few who ruin it for the rest of us.  If you give a cop respect you will be surprised what he/she are willing to do for you.  But, when you get attitude and people who are not willing to cooperate unfortunately these things happen.  Yes, people bring this on themselves more than you know.

"1","How many times do christen people finishes the bible?","I mean in Islam, Muslims finishes The Quran at lest every month or two and in Ramadan (month) some Muslims finishes the Quran more than 3 time.\nWhat about Christian people do they do that?","I'm sure many do.  My Grandma, for instance, can't see all that well so she listens to a program on the radio 15 minutes a day where the guy reads it to her and she follows along with her large-print Bible -- gets through it once a year.  \n\nA couple points I want to make though -- the Bible is MUCH longer than the Quran so that needs to be taken into account.  And in both religions, I think there needs to be a distinction between simply reading all the words and trying to understand and absorb what the book is telling you.  Too many ""religious"" people don't act at all like their religion would have them act.  So it's not just a matter of ""Do they read it"" but also ""Do they understand and apply it to their lives?"""
"1","I want to have sex more often but I think because my boyfriend masturbates, he's not horny enough.?","We've been together for 2 years. Also he doesn't like to perform oral on me.  I'm worried he's gay.  That was my first impression when I first met him too but he had a girlfriend.  Do all guys like to do oral?  This is only my second relationship.","I don't know that I quite understand all of your question.  What are you saying about your boyfriend masturbating?  Are you worried that because he masturbates, he's not horny enough to have more sex with you?  Believe me, masturbation doesn't change your sex drive; it merely takes care of it.  If he has enough desire to masturbate, he's got enough to have sex with you.\n\nAs for oral . . . no, not all men like to do it.  Some dislike the smell/taste, some find it difficult to do (I've heard things like complaints of tongue cramping, believe it or not), some feel it's beneath them (that a 'real man' can satisfy his woman through penetration alone), some merely don't care about her orgasm and won't do the work for it, some are nervous or feel inexperienced and don't want to do it because they're scared of failing (they don't know how to locate the clitoris; and some women are slightly hard to get off).  Or it's just not really their thing.  A lot of guys love to do it, but a lot don't, too.\n\nI can't say if your boyfriend's gay; you'll have to decide that.  But, if it's worth anything, there are straight males out there who masturbate often, don't like to perform oral sex on women, and don't have sex as often enough as their wives/girlfriends would like.\n\nHope that helps."

"1","Who exactly is Allah?","Ok, I know that Allah means God, and he is who Muslims pray to. But is Allah the same God that Christians pray to? I know that Muslims beleive in Moses and in Jesus, but they also believe in Mohammend. Muslims believe in Mohammend the same way that Christians believe in Jesus right? So if Muslims beleive in Jesus and Moses, then is Allah and God the exact same person/entity? Or is Allah totally seperate, like Buddah is? I am confused.","First of all, I am happy for you because of asking this question, since you are asking about none but your Creator, and as to your question.. well..\n\nLet us agree first that The Creator must be the creator of\neverything, the heavens, the earth an all that is in between them, mankind and all that exists. It is anticipated that anyone who says\n“I believe in the Creator,” that he believes in this. It also entails that he should necessarily believe that the Creator possesses Perfect Attributes. He is Perfect in His attributes, in Himself, in His Names,and in His Actions. This is a natural flow,\notherwise, it is a delusion not a true belief in the ""Creator.""\n""I believe in a Perfect Creator,"" should lead to another obvious admission: if you believe that the Creator is Perfect then He is\nPerfectly Wise in all of His Actions. Does He then Create because of a Perfect Wisdom, or aimlessly? This is the important linkage. Does He Create for a need? Or He\nCreates based upon Wisdom? It is anticipated that to be in harmony with having belief in the Creator, that His\nWisdom is necessarily is linked to His Knowledge, His Will and to all of His Attributes. The question, therefore, would you think the One who creates does so for a purpose or He creates to leave the creation aimless? The person who believes the Creator is Perfect, would agree that His creating is not aimless. If so, then Who else other than Allaah has stated this? And\nyou know where? It is in His Final Revelation to man. Contemplate what He has said: ""Did you think that We have created you in play without any purpose and that you\nwill not be brought back to us, so exalted be Allaah the true king none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the\nSupreme Throne” [Quran 23: 115-116]. Does man think that he will be left aimless (without purpose)? [Quran, 75:36].\nSo Allaah is the One whom you believe to be ""the Creator."" He chose this title for Himself and He stated that He is the Only\nCreator, and that He Creates with Wisdom: Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no god but He: Then\nhow ye are deluded away from the Truth! [Qur'an, 40:62].\nSo this creation which Allaah creates must have a code organizing its existence and its aims. \nHence: 1- Allaah creates and His creating is all Wise and for a purpose.\n2- Allaah did not leave us aimless. He set a code to live accordingly. So He legislates, commands, and prohibits,\nand justly sets reward and accountability, because He is all-\nJust.\n3- In all aspects of this code, the manifestations of His Names and Attributes become known, contemplated and realized. Being\nthe Creator necessitates creating as well as purpose, guidance and legislations. Whoever ascribes is rewarded, since He is the Most Generous. When one commits a sin,he realizes that his Creator accepts repentance and is oft-Forgiving. So the manifestations of Allaah's Names and Attributes become\nrealized on earth and this is beloved to Allaah, the Creator.\n4- Allaah gives man life, physical sustenance, and spiritual\nguidance through the revelation which He entrusted His Messengers with [like Jesus the son of Mary, Moses and Muhammed]. He guides man to know how to benefit\nfrom the provisions, what is good for him and what is harmful. He raises in honor those who submitted to Him,\nand justly puts in humiliation those who disdain and are arrogant. He Forgives and is Merciful; He punishes and rewards in order that man shapes his life with the code that is all beneficial to man and which makes his life on this earth upright. And it cannot be upright unless man ascribes to the guidance sent to him by His\ncreator.\n5- If all mankind come to ascribe to his code (i.e. worship) Allaah on one heart, then this does not oblige any change in Allaah's Essence nor in His Attributes. If all the creation is on one heart, this does not increase in the dominion of Allaah anything.\nThat is"

"1","People have been saying to me ""But what if you are wrong what if god does exist?"" well here is the answer.","If I am wrong and god does exist (which is unlikely) I can look him in the eyes and say I have tried to examine and understand the universe the best I could and I couldn't see you in it."" But now what if I'm right there is no supreme being for us to be afraid of offending no one can be accused of playing god because he doesn't exist so science is free to advance without hindrance and that will expanded our knowledge of the universe and save billions of lives as we develop new effective cures for diseases and improve billions of others as new technology is developed .  Also there wouldn't be as much discrimination or war as religion is the main cause of that.  Oh what a wonderful world it would be.  So there you go that is what happens if I am wrong and what happens if I'm right and personally I think it's worth the gamble (not much of a gamble as there is no evidence to suggest god does exist so that would mean I am right just the sooner you theists admit it the better for everyone).","Dude I totally agree with you plus how do we know the bible is true like seriously there is no proof to what they say in the bible it could all be a lie"

I have researched Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity (orthodox, mostly), Islam, Zoroastrian (tho there is not much info out there), and many other ancient religions. I've learned that we are alike in our general beliefs for how a person should live (such as not to lie, kill, cheat, etc.). I've also learned that most of our differences lie in how we worship of how we attain truth, faith, and God.\n\nHere is a quote from Kahlil Gibran translated, ""...each religion is merely a drop in the ocean of what is True faith..."" - the human mind cannot grasp all that is there...."

"1","Isn't it best for a minister or evangelist to have no interest in sexuality whatsoever.?","In the bible it says that it is better for a man to be single. It also says better to marry than to burn with passion. I myself refuse to marry. I refuse to have any interest in sexuality at all. I'm not gay, nor am I a minister. But nothing encourages me about being with a woman. I feel like I would be trapped and unable to do the things I want to do. I've had relationships in the past that where not anything I would like to experience again. And the older I get the less Important relationships are to me. There is only one who I feel that has the capability of showing real love and thats God himself. I don't believe people are able to give me what I need, only God. I think the world has gone way overboard on the importance of sexual activity. The make it seem like its the only reason we live or something. Which is the reason I hate it. So, I myself see no problem with a man of God being single by choice. It frees him of all distraction!","If it's good for you go for it. Others may find being married and having children their goal. As to a person in religious leadership, forcing abstinance shouldn't be required unless it appeals to them like yourself and such like the disciples."
"1","Are there any gay Muslims, Jews, or Christians out there?","What challenges have you faced in keeping with the faith?\n\nDo you have any stories you can tell us to open up our minds to your experiences and struggles?","Of course there are gay Muslums, Jews, and Christians.  While I have been raised Christian I can most identify with the latter of the three, but all gays and lesbians have encountered issues with these religions because they are all Abrahamic and therefor take many similar opions on the subject with one another.\n\nThe one religion I was brought up-Christian-is becoming more gay friendly in these devisive times.  While Catholocism has taken a strong stance against homosexuality-it still has followers who are organised to fight for gay rights within its church.  The American Episcopal Church of course has appointed a gay bishop in Massachussets which makes a bold statement on how that denomination is prepared to include gays and lesbians.  Also the Prespyterian Church has recently voted to allow gays and lesbians to be ministers and lay-people at the local level  (See link below).\n\nAs for personal experience, I have to admit I am feeling less Christian as I experience more rejection and hatred from Christian communities.  While there is progress being made, I find that while most churches are teaching inclusion-it is under the pretense that being homosexual is still wrong and that gays and lesbians should be accepted out of pity with the expectations that they should repent for their sexuality.  I disagree with this as gays and lesbians should be accepted into a Christian community free of the supposed guilt and stigma attached to their sexuality.\n\nThere are pro-gay Christian oranisations operating-though I have never attended their services.  The Universalists I have been told are very supportive of their gay followers."

What if he knows: what you will do, what we will say, even before you say it?\n\nthen is our destiny decided even before we are born? What does your religion say aboutt divine predestination?","For the Christian, God knows all. He knows what we will do and even think. But we don't. He has given us free will.

"1","Can you be an agnostic-christian?  Or is that just ""riding the fence""?","","Pascal seems to think so.  He set up this argument that it is better to live as a Christian than not to, just in case Christianity is true.  Well, to choose to live according to Christianity on that basis clearly indicates that one is an agnostic in reality.  But Pascal said that actions create belief, so that if you act like a Christian, before you know it, voila, you will believe in it!\n\nOf course, the major difficulty with Pascal's wager as I see it, is that he failed to factor in other religions.  What if Islam is right?  Then you've gambled on the wrong religion.\n\nBut anyhow, I DO believe that you can be an Agnostic Christian, an Agnostic Hindu, an Agnostic almost anything.  Because you are being very honest.  You are admitting that ultimately, no one knows.  And yet you still have your inclinations.  You are justified to follow the religion that you are inclined to most believe in, whether or not you are able to believe 100% in it or not.\n\nMost Christians have doubts, and some admit this.  There is not so much difference between a Christian with doubts and an ""agnostic-Christian"" perhaps."

MY mom and dad says taht as longs as I have a religion it's ok, as I'm an adult and old enough to do what I want.  So explain to me what are the pros and cons of juedaism.","I am Catholic so I will provide you the con of the action.\n\nYou have been baptised into the community of Jesus Christ in the Catholic Church. You have received Christ's Body and Blood at Mass.\n\nJudaism is a fine religion and I respect those who are Jewish. However, they were born and raised Jewish. You, on the other hand, at one point believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and received His flesh into your body.\n\nA religion is not a hobby. It is not a club to belong to. You cannot choose what you think you like the best. Judaism does not agree with this any more than Christianity does.\n\nYou act like you are buying a car and looking for the biggest bang for you buck and don't want to buy a lemon. This is not how God works whether you are Jewish or Christian. If I were you I would rethink just what each religion says their religion is. Because both do not say it is something you can just whimsically choose based upon a list of positives and negatives.\n\nI have the feeling that you don't go to Mass very often. If that is the case then it is obvious why you are leaving the Church. Would I also be correct in saying that you have not read an encyclical or even the writings of any of the Doctors of the Church? What about just reading a modern day apologist like Scott Hahn? Have you really thought this through and truly think you understand Catholicism and find it unappealing? I believe you may be Catholic, but have a misperception of your faith. Your parents have not taught you what Catholicism believes because Catholicism does not believe that as long as you have religion it is ok. It flies in the face of what Christ and the Catholic Church say about religion.\n\nI would strongly suggest that before you leave a faith that you have accepted (remember from Baptism the Holy Spirit is in you) you should come to understand just what you are leaving. Because it is no little thing to convert from the Catholic Church. If you had once believed in Christ then you are sinning by leaving your faith in Him."

We can't control the actions of other people, and they may do us harm- or, they may do something kind towards us. It's a matter of selection. \n\nBut I respect and honor your question. It's hard to deal with life sometimes. It's like, ""Where is justice""?\n\nIn the Bible, it does say that sometimes, the good people reap the bad things deserved by the wicked- and sometimes, evil men live long and happy lives. It's sad, but it's also true. I don't know why this happens- it's not fair. Life is not fair. However, I do believe that God is not cruel.\n\nSometimes, accidents happen, too. That is one way that innocent people can be hurt.\n\nYour question is very legitimate. I will be thinking about this for the rest of the day. Good job, mate!"
"1","how and why do you celebrate cinco de mayo?","","The 5th of May is not Mexican Independence Day, but it should be!  And Cinco de Mayo is not an American holiday, but it should be.  Mexico declared its independence from mother Spain on midnight, the 15th of September, 1810.  And it took 11 years before the first Spanish soldiers were told and forced to leave Mexico. \n\nSo, why Cinco de Mayo?  And why should Americans savor this day as well?  Because 4,000 Mexican soldiers smashed the French and traitor Mexican army of 8,000 at Puebla, Mexico, 100 miles east of Mexico City on the morning of May 5, 1862. \n\nThe French had landed in Mexico (along with Spanish and English troops) five months earlier on the pretext of collecting Mexican debts from the newly elected government of democratic President (and Indian) Benito Juarez.  The English and Spanish quickly made deals and left.  The French, however, had different ideas. \n\nUnder Emperor Napoleon III, who detested the United States, the French came to stay.  They brought a Hapsburg prince with them to rule the new Mexican empire.  His name was Maximilian; his wife, Carolota.  Napoleon's French Army had not been defeated in 50 years, and it invaded Mexico with the finest modern equipment and with a newly reconstituted Foreign Legion.  The French were not afraid of anyone, especially since the United States was embroiled in its own Civil War. \n\nThe French Army left the port of Vera Cruz to attack Mexico City to the west, as the French assumed that the Mexicans would give up should their capital fall to the enemy -- as European countries traditionally did. \n\nUnder the command of Texas-born General Zaragosa, (and the cavalry under the command of Colonel Porfirio Diaz, later to be Mexico's president and dictator), the Mexicans awaited.  Brightly dressed French Dragoons led the enemy columns.  The Mexican Army was less stylish. \n\nGeneral Zaragosa ordered Colonel Diaz to take his cavalry, the best in the world, out to the French flanks.  In response, the French did a most stupid thing; they sent their cavalry off to chase Diaz and his men, who proceeded to butcher them.  The remaining French infantrymen charged the Mexican defenders through sloppy mud from a thunderstorm and through hundreds of head of stampeding cattle stirred up by Indians armed only with machetes. \n\nWhen the battle was over, many French were killed or wounded and their cavalry was being chased by Diaz' superb horsemen miles away.  The Mexicans had won a great victory that kept Napoleon III from supplying the confederate rebels for another year, allowing the United States to build the greatest army the world had ever seen.  This grand army smashed the Confederates at Gettysburg just 14 months after the battle of Puebla, essentially ending the Civil War. \n\nUnion forces were then rushed to the Texas/Mexican border under General Phil Sheridan, who made sure that the Mexicans got all the weapons and ammunition they needed to expel the French.  American soldiers were discharged with their uniforms and rifles if they promised to join the Mexican Army to fight the French.  The American Legion of Honor marched in the Victory Parade in Mexico, City. \n\nIt might be a historical stretch to credit the survival of the United States to those brave 4,000 Mexicans who faced an army twice as large in 1862.  But who knows? \n\nIn gratitude, thousands of Mexicans crossed the border after Pearl Harbor to join the U.S. Armed Forces.  As recently as the Persian Gulf War, Mexicans flooded American consulates with phone calls, trying to join up and fight another war for America. \n\nMexicans, you see, never forget who their friends are, and neither do Americans.  That's why Cinco de Mayo is such a party -- A party that celebrates freedom and liberty.  There are two ideals which Mexicans and Americans have fought shoulder to shoulder to protect, ever since the 5th of May, 1862.  VIVA! el CINCO DE MAYO!!"

They may have the advantage of speaking it fast than us Filipinos but I am sure we do not lag behind when it comes to speaking and writing them in correct grammar and spelling.

He used to reside under their deck and never had this problem then.  I'm so mad at them for not controlling this.  It keeps us up at night and wakes us up before the sun rises.  It's so ANNOYING!!!!  What should I do???","No, don’t poison the dog; it’s inhumane.  (Besides, jails are noisy, too.)\n\nIf you haven’t already, talk with your neighbor.  Be aware that neighbors who leave their dogs outside to bark non-stop are sometimes unpleasant, uncooperative people, but they should be aware of the problem and given reasonable time to correct it.  If they won’t, tighten the screws.\n\nKeep a log.  For each day, document the times when the dog barks.  Get a camcorder and video tape it in action.  Leave the date/time stamp on, and be prepared to edit together a “greatest hits” tape (should be no longer than a couple minutes).  Do this for at least two weeks; four is better.  Depending on the neighbor, it might be best to do this secretly; or it might actually be best to let your neighbor see what’s going down.\n\nMeanwhile, check with local law officials or city to see if there's a barking/noise ordinance where you live.  You might also visit http://www.municode.com/resources/online%20Library.asp to see if there’s one.  If there is, call the police or animal control.  Animal control might tell you it’s up to the police to issue citations; the police might tell you animal control handles it.  Or an officer might tell you he has to witness it as it occurs, and the dog decides to take a ten-minute breather during his visit.  You might be told it’s a civil matter; (if there is an ordinance, it is a criminal matter).  Police sometimes won't do their jobs, so you might have to put an officer on camera while the dog’s barking and ask why a citation isn’t being issued.  This _will_ anger the officer, but your neighbor will certainly get the citation.  It will go to court, and you will probably be subpoenaed to testify.  Provide copies of the log and video tape to the city attorney and/or police; bring the originals with you to court.\n\nIf live in an area where there isn’t an ordinance, then it’s a civil matter.  You could take him to small claims, or talk it over with your attorney to see if you’re due a larger settlement (probably not).\n\nUnderstand if the neighbor doesn’t voluntarily curb the dog's barking and gets questioned by police, taken to court, fined, and so on, he’s going to be angry and may retaliate.  Be prepared in the event that he does.\n\nSo sorry to hear of another person going through this.  Best of luck."

Matt 5:43-44?","Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.1 Peter 5:8\n\nSo, we must love the devil?\n\nWhy can't god just make peace with the devil?\n\nWhy preach love and forgiveness when you yourself cannot live up to the standards you set.\n\nJesus said be perfect, like God is perfect.\n\nGod can't forgive his own enemy but wants us to forgive our enemy.\n\n\nWhat is up with this religion?","Jesus Christ said: “You heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.”—Matthew 5:43, 44.\n\nIt was the oral tradition of the Jews that held that ‘hating an enemy’ was the right thing to do. Jesus, however, said we must love our enemy, not just our friend. This is difficult but not impossible. Loving an enemy does not mean liking all his ways or his deeds. The Greek word found in Matthew’s account is derived from a·ga′pe, which describes a love that acts in harmony with principle. The person who manifests a·ga′pe, principled love, does good even to an enemy who hates and mistreats him. Why? Because it is the way to imitate Christ, and it is the way to conquer hatred. One Greek scholar noted: “[A·ga′pe] enables us to conquer our natural tendency to anger and to bitterness.” \n\nThe Christian, by contrast, is under obligation to love his enemies, that is, those who make themselves personal enemies. Such love (Gr., a·ga′pe) is not sentimentality, based on mere personal attachment, as is usually thought of, but is a moral or social love based on deliberate assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty, and propriety, sincerely seeking the other’s good according to what is right. A·ga′pe (love) transcends personal enmities, never allowing these to cause one to abandon right principles and to retaliate in kind. As to those who oppose his Christian course and persecute him, doing so in ignorance, the servant of God will even pray for such that their eyes might be opened to see the truth concerning God and His purposes.—Mt 5:44."

We do a lot of things together or with other friends.  We've been great friends & get along perfectly. We've both been single the course of knowing each other. I love everything about him, humor, sensitivity, brawn, everything he's a perfect match for me & I feel I'm the same for him.  I recently expressed how my feelings have grown & I'd like to be in a sexual/intimate & monogomous relationship with him...he has pushed me away yet has expressed that he feels the same. So the issue: He is HIV+ and I am HIV-.  He is afraid, I am not, I believe in romance, love, etc & feel that this is the man I want to take a chance & spend my life with. I know we can have a healthy safe relationship regardless of our different status. I know he feels for me.  Should I just stay friends, say goodbye or show him I'm there for the long haul good or bad and how?","Wow, Heavy!! You sound very wise for a 25 yr old. Ooops a stereotype. Sorry. Well, I have to agree on this-do not even worry about the age difference, it is not the issue and that will certainly pass if it is.  \n\nI commend you on your ability to wanting to stay through the ""long haul"", just be sure you have the strength for it.  I have a feeling this guy really cares for you and is probably having a difficult time right now depending on how long he has been HIV+. It is great that he cares for you and your health, but in my opinion one should never miss the opportunity to have a real love in their life in spite of an illness, disease, race or the rejection of society because of male/male or female/female.  To live a life in fear is a life half lived. Ask yourself how strong you really feel this bond is between you and stick with it.\n\nHelp him through his fears. Do not be afraid to make the HIV the center issue, because he will soon realize that you are truly there for him and vice vesa. Find information for him on HIV+ and HIV- couples from health advisors, clinics or the internet. Uunderstand that you can maintain a healthy safe, free from infection sexual and loving relationship.

"1","Why do ""people"" discriminate against blacks and puerto ricans?","","Ah, the age old question of discrimination.\n\nNow I know that you didn't think that you would be able to post such a question on Yahoo Answers and get a sincerely honest answer, did you?\n\nFor those of you who don't know or walk around with blinders on, racism still exists. A friend of mine and I were recently talking about racism. The irony of this is the fact that he is white, gay, republican and a reformed racist. (At my insistance, well at least that's what he tells me.) He had a very hard time being my friend because he was raised to believe that all black people were, well you know the n-word and all the negative connotations therein. He admitted it, yes he was raised that way by his father. The same man who abused and hurt him taught him to hate people of color. They moved way out into a rural area just to get away from minorities. Sad, but true. \n\nWell anyway, he told me that racism hasn't gone anywhere. (I kind of already knew that.) He said that it has just become no longer politically correct or socially acceptable to behave in a racist fashion in public. He told me that people still use the ""N-word"" when no one is around, and that the things that ""the man"" does to keep the black man down have become more sophisticated. This is true. Why is it that African American infants have the highest infant mortality rate in a modernized country? 9.3 infant deaths per 1,000 births. \n\nThe answer to why people discriminate against African Americans and Puerto Ricans is simple. Someone has to be at the bottom, in order for there to be a top. Eventually, money will be the factor that separates us. It will be the rich and the poor. But in the meantime it will be color, because as I have stated time and time again, people of color will never assimilate into the mainstream culture."

Which one do you think I should concentrate on learning, and what reasons do you have for your suggestion?","I think there's nothing wrong with learning a little bit of many different languages like you are doing now.  If you feel the need to concentrate on one, I recommend that you consider which languages are most available to you for learning (such as which ones are most convenient for you to take classes in, for example) and which ones you feel will be most useful to you in the future (such as with future boyfriends/girlfriends or in your future profession).\n\nIn addition, why restrict yourself to focusing on just one?  After you work on one new language for a while and you feel that your communicative needs are met, why not learn more?  Knowing more languages is its own reward, IMHO."

Now just look at the mindset of those Roman Catholics who burned gnostics and their writings, and imagine that these are the ones who chose the books for the bible. Do you think they were honest?

"1","What is the origin of the phoenix(bird), raising from the ashes?","","In ancient Egyptian mythology and in myths derived from it, the phoenix is a mythical sacred firebird.\n\nSaid to live for 500, 1461 or for 12594 years (depending on the source), the phoenix is a male bird with beautiful gold and red plumage. At the end of its life-cycle the phoenix builds itself a nest of cinnamon twigs that it then ignites; both nest and bird burn fiercely and are reduced to ashes, from which a new, young phoenix arises. The new phoenix embalms the ashes of the old phoenix in an egg made of myrrh and deposits it in Heliopolis (""the city of the sun"" in Greek), located in Egypt. The bird was also said to regenerate when hurt or wounded by a foe, thus being almost immortal and invincible — a symbol of fire and divinity.\n\nOriginally, the phoenix was identified by the Egyptians as a stork or heron-like bird called a benu, (see Bennu), known from the Book of the Dead and other Egyptian texts as one of the sacred symbols of worship at Heliopolis, closely associated with the rising sun and the Egyptian sun-god Ra.\nOne inspiration that has been suggested for the Egyptian phoenix is a specific bird species of East Africa. This bird nests on salt flats that are too hot for its eggs or chicks to survive; it builds a mound several inches tall and large enough to support its egg, which it lays in that marginally cooler location. The convection currents around these mounds resembles the turbulence of a flame."

Whether that be through futuristic prophecies, understanding your souls past, or understanding who you are today and why. I think life is all about understanding yourself and re-membering with your past. Dreams are a large part of how this happens. There is a difference between a spiritual dream and your mind taking out the days trash..though I suspect you can probably dechipher between the two. To answer your question simply... dreams serve all of the purposes you mentioned. Your job is to sort out what types of dreams you're having and interpret them appropriately. A dream log would do you wonders, write in it as soon as you wake up. There will be times when you think you didn't have a dream but if you lay in bed for a few minutes usually something will come to you. It takes time to train your mind  to remember these first words as soon as you wake - ""What was I dreaming?"" \nHope this answers your question!"
"1","Why is it people stay on welfare?","I've noticed that many people stay on welfare rather than taking advantage of the opprotunities available with continuing education. Why wouldnt someone go back to school while they're on welfare? It's not like they can't because they have a job to go to","People I've met that stay on welfare end up in a better financial situation then working full-time for minimum wage. Plus if you have children who need daycare, you end up working to pay the babysitter. It's a shame b/c continuing their education would get them a better job but either they don't think of it that way or they're lazy and don't want to try. This country definitely needs welfare reform AND disability reform. I've seen too many people take advantage of the system!"

"1","When do you hand out religious pamphlets?","Twice now at work I have had customers hand me born again Baptist pamphlets at work. I'm a cashier so basically, I ring these people up, they pay and then they hand me a pamphlet. There is nothing about my appearance, demeanor or manner of dress at work that screams ""SINNER"" as far as I'm aware. In fact, there is no way that they could be sure, not knowing me at all, that I am not a born again Baptist. Yet no one else at my work has been handed a pamphlet on the job. So my question is this, to anyone out there who hands out religious pamphlets: do you carry a lot with you and hand them out to any convenient person, or do you only carry a few and pick out people that seem like godless heathens based on appearance?","Hmm...are you the only cashier in the place?  If so, you are the most accessible employee there, the one with the most customer contact.\n\nI do something similar.  I used to hand out tracts from the American Bible Society, when they used to have tracts with little or no commentary, just pure Scripture.  I'd hand them out at events like parades or protests or with my Halloween treats for trick-or-treaters.  Unfortunately ABS was taken over by interests that turned ABS into just another conservative-run Christian outfit, and they no longer make those commentary-free tracts.\n\nA couple of times I've written and produced my own tracts.  When I discovered Vistaprint.com, I started ordering business cards that quote Scripture and point to my websites.  I hand out such cards to cashiers, bus drivers, token booth clerks, etc.  It doesn't matter to me what they look like.  We are all sinners, and we all need God.  I also include my cards in some mailings, and sometimes include them with greeting cards, or leave them at the ATM area of my bank, on the counter.  Oh, yeah, at parades and protest and Halloween treats and such.\n\nAll that said, it's possible that your tract-givers are of the ilk that hand out their materials only to those ""sinners"" they think really need them.  Maybe something about your appearance moves them to do this.  If so, I apologize to your for their bigotted behavior.  Please don't judge Jesus by them."

Koran also recognizes that Jerusalem is the Holy Land of Jews. But this can't interpreted as a deed of ownership. \n\nJews always try to distort it by purpose in order to make Moslims to serve them for the establishment of Big Israel State between two rivers, exactly like how they convince Christians that it is a Christian duty to support Jews cause they are chosen, etc.\n\nMoslims are not taught to be hate Jews. Moslims respect them and the fact that Jerusalem is their Holy Land. Their greedy unrealistic Big Israel Utopia which is covering whole Middle East and their violance in Palestine make Moslims hate them. \n\nSee, we respect them, their Holy Land, but as usual, it is not enough, they ask for the deed of ownership. \n\n\n[62-6,7,8] : Say (O Muhammad): O ye who are Jews, if ye claim that ye are the favoured of Allah apart from (all) mankind, then long for death if you are truthful.

"1","Fallen angels did become men?.....Christians..?","(Genesis 6:1,2) Here we learn that during the time from the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, until Noah's flood, some of the angels materialized fleshly human bodies and became fully involved with mankind. They became enticed with sin, and sinful desires.\n\n""There were giants (Hebrew: Nephilim) in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the Sons of God (angels) came unto the daughters of men (humans) and they bare children to them,the mutant offspring were giants, physically and mentally superior to humans, yet they were brutish, sensual, violent and immoral, and they were all males. \n\nGenesis 1-6. Bible believers, Angels DID become man, until the flood destroyed them. Does this make sense to anyone, and do you agree with this interpretation of the verse?\n\nIf you dont believe the Bible, and you want to spout of with some rude comment, feel free, but it will be ignored.","as far as I am aware the Angels good or bad cannot create as God has created, and so I doubt that they used materialized human flesh as this would not be physical flesh and bones as we have, and therefore could not transmit the seed of man this way.\nI think it is more probable that these demons actually posessed real human beings at the time, and if you consider that there were many pagan peoples at the time who worshipped false deities with human sacrifice, and dark incantations etc, then possession of these pagans would have been very likely."

"1","Communism..Why is and was it vilified and considered evil??","If communism is a pure state where all are equal financially and culturally, why consider it evil?? Is it not merely the desire of certain elite individuals to consider themselves more equal than others that caused the system to fail?? What would be wrong with equal medical and social systems for all??","Think about it for a moment. The core concept of Comunism is that all are equal right?  For all to be equal that means you must bring everybody down to the lowest common denominator. How else can such equality be achieved?  You can only bring certain people up to a certain level. There are inherent physical limits that all people are born with. Some may be good at one thing or another. To equalize people is to bring them down to what the weakest link is capable of. In effect you make the whole chain as strong as the weakest link. \n\nLets look at Comunism on a grand scale. In a pure Commie society you have each person assigned to what is judged to be their best place to contribute to society. On the top it sounds great right? Of course everybody assumes they'll get one of the good jobs. Most jobs suck. So most people will get stuck doing something they hate. If you take it to it's literal ends, then all good jobs would be removed because by deffinition they set somebody up as elite. Astronauts, musicians, atheletes, and so on. By being made one of those they are instantly made elite.  In reality many of these jobs are necessary to the functioning of society. So the absolute ideal is literally impossible.  Not everybody is capable of singing.  To make somebody who can sing like an Angel tote garbage while forcing a tone deaf person to do vocals is a bigger injustice than creating an elite because of an innate ability they are born with.  Not everybody can be a rocket scientist or a skilled surgeon. Would you honestly want randomly chosen people to be your doctor if your life was on the line? \n\nSo even with the best intents Comunism does and by necessity has to put people up as elite.  Instead of people choosing their field and putting their talents out there for the general public to judge relitive talent another group of elites judge. You have to have somebody to decide who does what. Who allocate resources and people to tasks. I guess technically today you could use computers  to do that with standardized testing. However what about subjective areas such as art? How can a computer judge that?  Or do you do away with arts all together? \n\nNext comes the biggest hidden injustice of all socialisms. The very core ideal of socialism of any sort relies on each person carrying out the collective will.  For it to work each person MUST work inside the collective will.  By deffinition every dissenter, every person who does not abide by the collective will damages the collective. They reduce the already margional tolerances the society has for survival. Dissenters are a threat to the survival of a collective society. If any large movement starts the collective will collapses. For it to exist the collective MUST have almost unanimous support. Each person must strive to carry out their part of the collective efforts. If the shoemakers for example dissent, then everybody goes without shoes. If the farmers do not pull their share of the work, then everybody starves. So every person must do their assigned work to the best of their ability. \n\nNow think about that for a moment. Try to picture getting 100 of even like minded people to agree completely on even the implementation of a goal they all want. I've never seen it happen. There has always been egos, power plays, disagreements over methods, laziness, poor judgement, emotionalism, favortism and a hundred other very human things which interfere with the collective. It's natural. It is to be human to dissent. To feel that your own opinion and worth is greater than others. \n\nAs a result, the collective to survive must prevent dissent. They must curtail any actions which prevent people from doing anything but their best for the collective. All must volentarily bow to the collective will or the collective will becomes a tyranny. Since you cannot get functional humans to lose such things as ego, subjective emotions such as taste, opinion and belief. Then such traits must b"

[The evidence that this grave is attended, visited and cared for, is respectful for the deceased - NS]. Also, it may hark back to biblical days when the monument was a heap of stones. Often the elements or roving vandals dispersed them, and so visitors placed other additional stones to assure that the grave was marked.""\n\n\n\nAlso, by placing a stone we further participate in the ""construction"" of the tombstone -- which in itself constitutes a mitzvah.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, it is not a Chabad custom to place stones on tombstones"

The most complete account of Ixion's tale comes from Pindar in his Pythian Odes. Ixion was the son the Phlegyas, descendent of Ares, and king of the Lapiths in Thessaly. He is significant in many respects, but is chiefly known as the first human to shed kindred blood. This occurred when Ixion invited his father-in-law, Deioneus, to come and collect the price that Ixion owed him for his bride. Upon his arrival, Deioneus fell into a pit filled with burning coals Ixion had camouflaged.\n\nBecause this was a crime new to the human race, nobody could purify Ixion and he wandered an exile. Zeus took pity on him and decided not only to purify Ixion, but to invite him to Olympus as a guest. Once in Olympus though, Ixion became so enamored of Hera, and he desired to sleep with her. Zeus did not believe that Ixion would be so disrespectful as to have designs upon the wife of his host. To see if the rumors were true, Zeus made an image of Hera out of a cloud, and impregnated it. The cloud bore Ixion the monster Centaurus, who was unloved by the Graces and had no honor among men or the gods. Centaurus then mated with the mares of Mt. Pelion in Magnesia, and so from Ixion the race of centaurs was born.\n\nTo punish him, Zeus bound Ixion to a winged (sometimes flaming) wheel, which revolved in the air in all directions. Also, by order of the gods, Ixion was forced to call out continuously call out: ""You should show gratitude to your benefactor."" Ixion became one of the more famous sinners on display on Tartarus, and most writers mention him when describing the place. For example, Ovid wrote of him, and Vergil, with his moralistic interpretation of how sin should be punished, awards Ixion a special mention in the Aenead.\n\nThe focus of Ixion's mythology on the guest/host relationship shows the venerable age of Ixion's story. Of all the attributes Zeus became associated with, he was originally particularly worried that the custom of Xenia, the formal institution of friendship that ensured traveling archaic Greeks could count on each other for safety in antiquity, be enforced (for more on this in all the Greek world see Powell 150; the importance of the guest/host relationship is fundamental to all world mythology, take the Biblical story of Sodom and Gommorah, for example).\n\nAeschylus remembered Ixion's role as the purified progenitor of blood guilt in the Euminides. Athena, before she will hear Orestes' case refers to him as Ixion, an allusion Orestes balks at and tries to convince her is false (Euminides. 450-455).\n\nPirithous, king of the Lapiths, good friend of Theseus, and important in later myth, is considered to be one of Ixion's children. There is another claimant to Pirithous' paternity though. Zeus, in the Iliad 14. 317-318, claims to have seduced Dia, Ixion's wife, and fathered Pirithous.\n\nI got that info from this link: http://www.pantheon.org/articles/i/ixion.html\n\nXena could be based on that character because the name sounds simalar.\n\nCould Gabrielle be based on this character:\nThere is only one character from myth, fable, or history that relates to Gabrielle, Xena's fa","the characters are based on Greek mythology"

"1","A question on Christianity for atheists?","I’ve noticed that several questions pertaining to Christianity get answers like, “OMG YOUZ R BRAINWASHED LOLZ!!!11!”  To those of you who feel the need to point out your intellectual superiority rather than attempt to actually answer the question posed, what is it that you hope to accomplish?  Do you believe that if you just insult Christians enough by calling them idiots that they will suddenly accept you r way of thinking?  Obviously this question is not directed all atheists, but neither is it rhetorical.  I really want to know why some of you respond to Christians this way.  As an atheist myself, I pride my self on my ability to engage in rational discussion on religious topics, and to be honest I find some of your answers to be downright embarrassing.  I suppose it may be wishful thinking to expect you to give my question any more respect than others, but I’d still like an answer.","I am an athiest. well know agnostic. well I don't know, but I do not follow any organized religion. I do, however, have respect for every religion that is out there and the people that are involved. If it works for them, good for them. The problem comes when they insist on trying to convert me to their religion(christianity mostly). I can't stand it. I have to figure out what I believe on my own, and I do not feel I need a book to tell me what is right and wrong.\nI honestly believe that the athiests who lash out at christians are jealous. They want to have something that they can believe the way Christians believ in God. The crave it, but push it away, and hate those that embrace it.\n\n\n\n\nI am offended by ""smartarse"" below me.

"1","White minority?","Is it possible for a white person to be considered a minority? lets say a white person lives in an all black neighborhood (like the south side of chicago) and they never see anyone else but black people. would they be considered a minority? Has anyone ever been considered a minority like this?","Sure, white people can be considered a minority; it just depends on the scale you're looking at.  If you're talking about the United States, you will never hear white people referred to as a minority category, even though I think I recently heard they have fallen below 50% of the population; it's just that no other ethnic group has a greater percentage.  But if you're looking at a neighborhood, or even a city or state, it is quite possible for white people to be the minority.  I'm white, and I used to live in Harlem, so I was definitely a minority.  I got called ""whitey"" quite often... but then maybe I asked for it, as I was training for long-distance road races at the time, running through Harlem in really short shorts and no shirt!  Anyway, I think it's a valuable experience for everyone to be put in the position of being a visible minority at least once in their life."

OK read the following:\nIn the 1960's in Srilanka ""JVP"" which stands for ""Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna"" and in English means PLF ""People Liberation Front"" was established by its Buddhist leader ""Rohana Wi Jeveera"" and from the name of the organization you can understand their aims. They were killing and fighting for liberation. Finally in the 1990's the leader was killed by the government and the rest of the members reached an agreement with the government and now some of them are ministers.

I do remember people treating me coldly for some strange reason, it was like they knew something I didn't. So I felt like a was just tagging along. It was an awful feeling.\n\nI don't know.

I don't like to grin & just bear it. I don't express myself in an awful way either. I don't remember being rude to anyone.","Practice having more spontaneity when sticking to a plan doesn't accomplish anything extra.

"1","Fellow Christians (or anyone) What are your views on the origin of the world and people?","this is basically Creationism vs. Evolution","think about the eye.  it's no good if all you have is an eyeball, yet lack an optic nerve to transmit the light as an electric signal, or an occipital cortex to interpret the electric pulses back into a picture.\n\nso how could the eye have evolved?  suppose some primordial worm starts getting two black dots on its head that will eventually turn into eyes.  suppose they eventually turn into eyes.  he still can't see.  this is not a viable mutation as it has no possible survival value or advantage over the other plain ol' worms.  an eye is no good unless every other part of the visual system is already intact.\n\nso a gradual evolving a pair of eyes won't work, since it will hinder the creature's survival before it will actually help it out.  the only way natural selection favours evolutionary andvancements is through ''hopeful monsters.'' a lizard hatching a bird, a worm with no eyes giving rise to one with eyes in a single generation.\n\nand that's another thing.  what if a lizard tried to grow longer and longer scales in hopes that they'd one day become feathers?  well, there comes a point where this lizard has half feather/scales, on some rather cumbersome, yet extremely fragile wing-like ''hands,'' which it can no longer use for running from predators, yet, it still cannot fly.  natural selection would quickly weed out such a transitional creature.\n\nand that's another thing...where are all these transitional fossils that had to be here?  since evolution took place over millions and millions of years, right?  (the earth's age is actually closer to what the bible says, anyway, as the speed of light is slowing down, and used to be much much faster in the past, according to modern quantum physics and other considerations, [see sources] so radioactive decay used to be much faster in the past, making radio-carbon dating yeild ages far too old)....there actually wasn't even enough time for things to evolve.  the only way evolution could've happened was by hopeful monsters...\n\nwhat about the peppered moth, mike?  what about it?  there's a variation in the species.  what about red heads and brunettes? ;-)  okay, what about the tiny 18 inch tall horses in fossil records?  well, modern, wild brown horses can be selectively bred to get tiny little horses like that.  yes, it takes about 80 years, but it can be done.  (evolutionists tend to call this ''micro-evolution'' just to get a foothold ;-)  )  what's more, regular house cats have been successfully bred with lions to produce ''medium sized'' cats.  this only shows that there is a wide variance in the species, but it's still one kind.  evolution states that one species will change so much over a period of time that it cannot breed with other species that have branched off in different directions."

And if you don't then why are you in a religion that does?  I, too, was born a Catholic but once I started reading the bible, I could see the evil in the religion and had to get out.  Most Catholics seem to pick and choose what parts of Catholism they want to keep and what parts they  want to toss out and think it's ok to stay in it. God called Israel a harlot for tolerating pagan practices like these.  He said of the great harlot in Rev. ""Come out of her my people"".  Most non-christian churches don't denounce Christ, they just corrupt his teachings.  And what about how they tortured and murdered Christians in the midevil times.

It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired.

"1","Has anyone converted to Catholicism from a Protestant background?","I do not want to hear about converting because of marriage or something where your heart wasn't in it. If it was other than this, why did you convert? Was it because you were dissatisfied with something in the Protestant services, you had a revelation that Catholicism was the truest form of Christianity, or something else. Please only those that converted out of heart felt reasons answer, and not those that were coerced or something and you could care less about Jesus. (like it seems so many are when it is Prot=>Cath) Please convince me otherwise.","I was born and raised Southern Baptist.  I never felt at home in that faith.  I always felt like an outsider looking in.  I went to church Sun morn, Sun eve and Wed eve every week without fail for my entire childhood.\n\nI graduated from high school and moved out on my own.  After a period of staying out of churchs completely, I felt empty in my heart.  After a lot of soul searching I figured out that the emptiness in my heart was due to my being out of the will of God.  In order to fill that emptiness I had to reconcile myself to God. \n\nI tried going back to the Baptist Church, but I still never felt like I was a part of that.  At the time I worked with two Catholics.  They had a peace about them that I wanted in my life!  They talked openly about being Catholic, they weren't ashamed of it.  And I could tell that being Catholic was a big part of their entire life--not just a trip to church twice on Sunday and once on Wednesday nite.\n\nSo I did some more research.  I liked what I read about the Catholic faith.  And I began to take instruction in the Catholic faith.  This has been one of the hardest things I've ever done in my whole life.  All my life as a Baptist I was taught that Catholics were going to hell because they worshipped Mary and the Saints.  That they prayed to statues.  That the Roman Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon mentioned in the Book of Revelation.  That you ask Jesus to forgive you, not a man---even if the man is a priest.  And so on and so forth, ad infinitum ad nauseum.\n\nIt took a lot of study and prayer to find the answers to all those bogus notions I'd been taught.  Catholics don't worship Mary or the Saints--we venerate them.  We don't pray to statues---that's just dumb.  I don't believe the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon.  Jesus gave the power to forgive sins and cast out demons in his Name to his disciples.  And its ok to confess your sins to a priest.  \n\nI took instruction for about six months.  I joined the Catholic Church about 25 years ago and I've never regretted a minute of it.  I finally feel at home in a church.  I'm active in my local Church--I help out at Mass and I teach in our Parish School of Religion.  \n\nI have a peace in my heart and soul that I never felt when I was Baptist.   And I still hear the same bone headed things that I heard as a kid about Catholics.\n\nHas this cost me anything?  Yes.  My father, a die-hard Baptist, never accepted my conversion.  Until his dying day he still would not talk about it.  That hurt a lot.\n\nBut I have a church home now--and a solid faith in my Lord Jesus--who saves me from my sinful nature by his Grace alone.  I can't earn my salvation--its a gift from the Lord.  \n\nWould I do it over again?  Yes---although I probably would've not drug my heels so much and made the conversion much sooner."

Clouds is used by Paul for a throng.\nHeb.12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, \nTHE AIR\nThe word “air” Greek (aer) means “to breathe, respire”, NOT SKY.

"1","How can we trust God's ability to judge, if He doesn't even see the difference between various sins ?","If i don't kill my brother, but i say that i did, then i commit the sin of lying\nif i kill my brother, then i commit the sin of murder.\n\nTo God they are equally bad. Any sane creature knows they are are not equaly bad. How can i trust His ability to judge me?","Fantastic question!  Take the Christian belief that each of the 10 commandments are all equally as bad as the other and that all you have to do to get to heaven is repent for all of these sins.  That would mean that if people like Charles Manson on their death bed simply prayed for forgiveness and truly felt that what they did was wrong, then he would go to heaven.  Yet if a person disliked their parents who beat them and called the police, got them thrown in jail and never had contact with them again, even if the parents tried to apologize, and the person never felt bad about it, they would be denied entry into heaven because they weren't sorry or repentant for breaking the commandment of ""Honor thy Father and thy Mother...""  This, by the way, is the same god that a good chunk of Christians believe will not allow a child into heaven if the parents did not have him/her baptized.  I think at some point we have to ask ourselves if there is a God, is he simply ticked off that somewhere, someone made up rules and stories of things they claim he said to do and that to this day millions of people hold those beliefs and spread them, that perhaps he's allowing the world to suffer a bit to get them to stop being sheep, following blindly, spreading hate and intolerance for others (I'm talking here about those like the ""Christians"" who protest at private funerals for our millitary personnel killed in Iraq by saying that God is punishing us for allowing homosexuality).  \n\nThink about this:  The 21st ecumenical council was announced by Pope John XXIII on January 25, 1959.  This council said that \nit was acceptable for woman to pursue pastorate positions because there was a shortage of priests at the time. Many parishes then allowed female pastorates and they rapidly gained popularity. However in 1994, the Pope John Paul II wrote a letter of decree banning further talk of ordaining women as priests.   Many women took demotions to comply with the writings of one man, who with one letter simply changed what had been acceptable for nearly 40 years.  \n\nHistory is full of ""rules"" that have changed in the Roman Catholic church, simply on the whim of the Pope and changing societal beliefs.  Who knows, next thing, maybe there will be degrees of heaven and hell and we'll all have to pay money to improve our lot in life.  In that case, the consequences for lying might be 3 hours a day in hell, the rest in heaven....\n\nSo, I'm thinking if there is a God, he's just ticked off that everyone is missing the basic message of be good to each other and do your best to be a good person.  And until people stop interpreting supposed facts and happenings in ways that suit them at the time, we're all in big trouble."

In some places it says ""Gehenna"" or ""the valley of the son of Hinnom"" which is an actual place ON Earth; a place where people of Israel were actually burned. Jesus only spoke of this place metaphorically,in parables. The other way ""hell"" was translated was from the word ""tartaros,"" which is Greek, or ""Sheol"", which is Hebrew. Both meaning ""the grave.""  The souls of everyone go to Sheol where they rest until the day of Judgment.  No reference to fire and eternal punishment after death in either of this translations.\n\nWhen the Bible talks about the Lake of Fire (which is NOT Hell), everyone thinks pain and suffering. But the in Semitic Middle East, fire is a symbol of GOD. Jesus said ""He came to send fire on the earth and He yearned for it to be kindled."" (Luke 12:49)\nObviously he is talking about fire in the sense of God, not suffering. Moreover, when the Bible talks about the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, the word ""Brimstone"" is translated from the word ""Theion"" which means ""Divine."" So in other words the ""Lake of fire and Brimstone"" should really translate into ""Lake of Divine Purification""  This is not where man is destroyed, but his sin is destroyed."

It has also been linked to the fact that a lunisolar calendar must have 13 months in some years, while the solar Gregorian calendar and lunar Islamic calendar always have 12 months in a year. Another suggestion is that the belief originated in a Norse myth about twelve gods having a feast in Valhalla. The mischievous Loki gate-crashed the party as an uninvited 13th guest and arranged for Hod, the blind god of darkness, to throw a branch of mistletoe at Balder, the god of joy and gladness.

The meaning of the Crucifixion is far greater than the seeming display of physical vulnerability and pain:  Our vulnerability to each other and to our bodies.\n\nThe Crucifixion was undertaken by Him as the greatest learning tool He could use and teach by.  After the people saw  the ultimate physical abuse taking place - to an extent that leads to death - He then offered the Final Statement:  What God Created. . . cannot be destroyed.  The physical is perishable, but not what God Created.  Notice. . .He reappeared in his physical image again, and remained in it until He desired to leave.  Note:  The physical image he appeared in contained a ""hole"" for the others to see, but the blood, the bruising, the torn and tattered flesh were all absent !\n\nInside of us, and coupled with our human Intellect is a thing called soul or spirit.  Jesus and the Holy Spirit teach how to live through that - more than through the logic of the Intellect.  They both SERVE us in this physical life - the Intellect and the Soul.\n\nJesus can also TEACH how to use our God-given soul or Spirit-Mind to block out or transcend the pains of the physical.  He willingly teaches that WE ARE NOT VULNERABLE ;  to each other, or to the human Intellect !  Not all of us become Masters as He did and master life.  But, Jesus can teach level upon level of God's Thoughts and Knowledge to us - IF we choose to learn it, and ask for that.  \n\nPresently, I am working on that very thing.  Transcendence and Detachment.  To do this, you must have something to ""go up against.""  Something to test against.  I have experienced the inflictions of physical pain - and, according to His instruction, through my Mind, have learned to ""banish"" it.  Many, many of us have learned this.  Ghandi spoke of the horrifying beatings he received at the hands of his opposers.  He was taken to the hospital more than once so bruised, bloodied and purpled that it was not understood how he bore the pain.  He said, that although the body showed the infliction - he did not FEEL it !  We have no idea how powerful our souls or spirit-minds are.  And the joy of tapping into its power.  Many non-notable people, as you have mentioned, and now me too (!) have experienced the gifts of Spirit and some degree of Mastery over the physical.  It's real.\n\nWhen we are taught that after Ascension Jesus rose to rest and sit at the right hand of God and is no longer teaching on earth - we should be aware that there is a slight mis-perception in that.  He DID go before our Creator.  He was allowed to ""speak"" with Him.  But, He was quickly placed in charge of the Sonship and ceaselessly and intensely teaches us through Mind-to-Mind.  We receive His tutoring when we invite Him and then learn to hear his voice through our mind.  \n\nThe Sons of Man (Us) are much more. . .than we appear to be.  Something else Created our Minds.\n\nBest regards, Lana"

They killed animals for food and clothing. They respected the animals as brothers who shared this planet. Nothing was left to waste. \n\nI feel that the animal rights movement is a good one as corporate giants would utterly disrespect animals (and the planet) for profit.

"1","why are marines called jarheads?","","JUGHEAD originally meant mule. ‘Jughead’ dates back to the late 19th century when it meant fool and by the 1910’s it had come to be a general term of abuse and also referred to a mule whose large chunky head denoted stubbornness and stupidity.\n\nJARHEAD started out as meaning mule probably ultimately from the pronunciation of ‘jawhead.’ In 1899 the mule became the mascot of the Army football team (to counteract the Navy goat) which could have had something to do with the military relationship. Of course a military icon wouldn’t have been picked for its stupidity so it is said that it was chosen as the mascot because ‘it reflects the long-standing usefulness of the animal in military operations -- hauling weapons, ammunition, and supplies. Strong, hearty, and persevering, the mule is truly an appropriate symbol for the Corps of Cadets.’ There are those who think that the term ‘leatherneck comes from the idea of the neck of the mule, but that term actually derives from the leather-lined collar which was formerly part of the uniform (1910-15).\n\nJarhead and jughead eventually merged to become slang synonyms for marine. Jughead was originally used to refer to members of a machine-gun company in WWI (‘the JUGHEAD gunners had it off the tripod and were tapping heads with it’). Before WWII JARHEADS was already in widespread use. A 1933 article stated ‘the [Marine] sergeants …moved into the second class cabins, and it took three days and a squad of JARHEADS to get them and their baggage moved to the troop class.\n\nDictionaries and military history websites seem to give varying explanations for the origin of JARHEAD. In addition to the above ideas, here are a few more:\n\nA U.S. Marine. Perhaps from the shape of the hat the Marines once wore. (American Heritage Dictionary of English)\n\nA slang term used by sailors as early as World War II to refer to members of the Marine Corps, drawing the term from the resemblance of the Marine dress blues uniform, with its high collar, to a Mason jar which at the time was made from blue glass. (military history website)\n\nGRUNT, or Marine. Reportedly, due to the ""high and tight"" haircut favored by many marines; it looks as if someone put a bowl on the victim’s head and cut or shaved off all the hair that protruded.\n\nNote: Definitions, dates, and quotes were assembled from Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Cassell’s Dictionary of Slang, Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, various ('repectable-looking) websites.""\n\n\nYou can find more info at the following web site:\n\nhttp://www20.brinkster.com/gunnyg/jarhead.html\n\nHope this answers your question."

I've observed that when i pray and do good SATAN bug me 24 hours and  very bad eekky things comes in my mind about my ALLAH and my religion which is why i've tried to suicide couple of times. I don't know what to do please give me some advice. I can't live my life like this.","Salamu Alaykum,\nMy advice to you is to depend on Allah, Put your full trust in Allah. For Allah Says in the Quran\n""If a suggestion from satan assail thy (mind), seek refuge with Allah. for He heareth and knoweth (all things).""(Ch7 V.200)  \nThe last two Chapters(113&114) in the Quran if Recited help to ward off evil and in Ch.2 V.255. Reciting these with sincerity to Allah should ward off evil. \n\nAllah also says in the Quran:\n""O ye who believe! follow not satan's footsteps: if any will follow the footsteps of satan, he will (but) command what is shameful and wrong: and were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you, not one of you would ever have been pure: but Allah doth purify whom He pleases: and Allah is One Who hears and knows (all things)."" (Ch.24 V.21)\n \nDo not let Satan trick you play with your mind just ignore the thoughts which are bad. A muslim does not get accounted for Bad thoughts. Do not take it to hard on yourself for having Bad thoughts it happens to most muslims. You should never let this lead to suicide then satan would have achieved his goal. Any time you have bad thoughts About Allah rember Allah says""He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is Nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees (all things).""\n(  سورة الشورى  , Ash-Shura, Chapter #42, Verse #11)\n\n""There is Nothing Whatever like unto Him"" This shows us that there is nothing even close to comparison to Allah so anytime you have a bad thought about Allah remember that the thought cant be Allah cause ""There is Nothing Whatever like unto Him"" and just wipe that thought out/ignore it.\n\nAnother thing you could do is to gain Knowledge about ISlam the more you learn the less doors Shaytan has to attack you with.\n\nAlso you should not say ""my Allah or my Religion"" because Allah doesnt belong to us but we(mankind&Jinn) belong to Allah and to Him is our return. The religion of Islam is also for everybody. Maybe you did not mean to say this in the way i interpreted It but just in case.\n\nInshaAllah this information has been Helpful if I said Anything Good it is from the Grace Of ALLAH and if Said anything wrong it is from myself.\n                   Salamu Alaykum WaRahmatuAllahi WaBarakatu"

I met people who were not in favor of arranged marriage but did not want to disobey or shame their parents so they would go through with it when the time was right.  I divorce in that sense would shame the family.  Also because it is arranged and in many Indians case Dowry is exchanged it is more like a business deal.  In the West our parents are not involved.

"1","What is the place and respect of lord SUN in Sikhism?","Sun means surya in hindi & Suraj in PUNJABI","Sikhism is a branch of hinduism , though influenced by sufism. Sikhs are very much hindus otherwise. Most of them follow all hindu beliefs. They may not practice sun practice specially but they celebrate sun related festivals and rever it this way. Sankrati , lohari all are related with sun.\n\nAdded:\nAnswerer below me is ignorant about sikhism even if he belongs to it. \n\n""Hinduism is a generic name given to all the faiths which have roots in India and believe in Parmatma (God), Prarthana (prayer), Punerjanma (reincarnation), Purushartha (Karma) and Prani Daya (kindness to all living beings)."" Sikhism believes in all of these.\n\n The Granth contains specific references to Hindu gods such as Rama and Krishna. The gurudwaras, or Sikh temples, have always been decorated with pictures of Hindu devas and devis. The first desecration of these pictures was in 1906 at Harmandir, and this was the first action taken by separatist Sikhs.\n\nReference is made to the avatars of Vishnu in the Granth Sahib. The Dasma Granth deals with all the avatars beginning on page 169. Volume two of the Dasma Granth is exclusively based on Krishna. It is accepted that Guru Gobind Singh was a staunch believer in Durga Mata (Mother Goddess). In the entire Guru Granth Sahib, the Vedas are respected and referred to as sacred. Guru Gobind Singh states that the Vedas originated from Brahma and the path of the Vedas is the only path for the people to follow. Sikhism heavily bases itself on Karma yoga (the science of actions) and states that if an individual acts only on good deeds, selfless acts with a pure devotion to God, they can achieve the ultimate state of existence.\n\nThe speech of one of the greatest modern Sikh leaders, Master Tara Singh, at a meeting in Bombay on August 19, 1964, who declared:\n\n""Sikhs and Hindus are not separate. Sikhs will survive only if Hindus survive. Sikhs are part and parcel of the Hindu Society. Guru Govind Singhji brought in Gurumukhi the wisdom and philosophy from our scriptures and Puranas.

"1","When in the Bible, It says ""Thout shalt not kill"", Does that Mean do not kill animals and bugs too?","This bothers me. Please answer.","Man was given dominion over the animals because he has reason. It is also in his rational nature that his dignity resides. If you think there is a difference between man because he cans think and choose to do right and wrong, then there must be a difference between his dignity as a person and the dignity of animals. Because of his dignity as steward and caretakers of the animals on this earth, he must treat them with respect and reverence but not as his equals because they do not think and do not make choices.\n\nSince the commandments were given by God to all of mankind in order that he might follow his laws and be in community, it is the law between men in society, and therefore it does not apply to animals and bugs. That does not mean the man should wantonly kill animals for no reason, but it does not forbid him from killing them for food or being their are pests to his crops, and well being. For example, mosquitoes bring to man many diseases, it would not be right for him to refrain from killing them if they cause serious illness or death to his family and himself. \n\nI hope that helps."

"1","how does a baptist lead a mormon to christ?","","Mormons believe: God is an exalted man.  Elohim, the God of this universe, was previously a man in a prior existence.  As a result of having kept the requirements of Mormanism, he was exalted to godhood and inherited his own universe.  God is confined to a body of flesh and bones and yet is thought to be omniscient and omnipotent.  He obviously can not be omnipresent.  There are an infininte number of gods with their own worlds.  These too were previously men, The Holy Ghost, Jesus Christ and ""Heavenly Father"" comprise 3 separate and distinct gods. Heavenly Father sires spiritual children in heaven destined for human life on earth.  All humans, as well as Jesus Christ and Lucifer, are gods heavenly children.  Every human being has the potential of becoming a god by keeping the requirements of Mormonism.  The Morman plan of salvation is built on the idea that all people have eternal life, but only the most faithful Mormons have godhood or enter the celestial kingdom.  In order to obtain this ultimate step, Mormons must exercise faith in the God of Mormonism, its Christ, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; exercise repentence; and be baptisted in the LDS church.  Additionaly Mormons must keep the ""Word of Wisdom"" by abstaning from alcohol, tobacco, and caffiene; tithe to the church; attend weekly sacrament meetings; support the Mormon prophet; do temple works; and be active in their support of the Church.  \n\nIs this Christianity, I think not."

Those actions have repercussions.  You reap what you sow, as it were... though that speaks more of karma than of judging God.  Anyway.  I suggest you keep your own record and take care of things the best way you can, as it seems highly unlikely anyone else is going to do it for you.  ;)"
"1","What is more supreme for you, individual liberty or social order?","This is serious question. please state your country as well, I really need serious answers as well.  I'm doing research. thank you\n\nTerms:\nIndividual liberty: free press, free expression, privacy ...etc\n\nSocial order: stability, normal traditional life, everything going normal, no such problems.  \n\nIdea: the question is whether you think that individual liberty is more important, and it's holy, you can't touch it even if it is for sake of social order.   OR, do you think social oder is more important than individual liberty.  for example: wath your telephone calls randomly (invading your privacy) in order to make society stable, detect crimes and terrorism more easy.   limit your free press (for instance, don't talk about this, don't talk about that) in order to stop any inflamming of feelings in society.  \nThank you","Social order without education, individual empowerment and individual thinking is a time bomb.\n\nUsually and educated, critically minded population will need much less social or legal support to create social cohesion. Common sense will drive debates and dialogue and communications will prevail. When the instances are not doing their jobs such as not protecting individual rights over lobbyist or politically or social and religious agenda, then chaos sets in. \n\nPeople who do not know how to communicate, that havent leran how to think and take responsibility can then take over the common space and reat chaos.\n\nSocial Order tends to hide real issues. It eliminates nuances along with an indivudual sense of accontability and responsibility and creativity.  Social Order only comes with education and a culture of acceptance of diversity. If social order is imposed without any educations and self empowering programs or legislature, it is only a time bomb."

Their inspiration has lead me to do many things, can I say any of the things that I have done are a reflection of their will?  \n\nGeorge Orwell was inspired somewhat by Hitler when he wrote 1984, does that mean that 1984 was partially composed by Hitler and merely penned by Orwell?  \n\nIn that case Hitler deserves co-authorship at least.","Great question!  Good question to know the answer to before digging into religion.\n\nReligious inspiration is inseparable from Faith! Though I like Schneb and all the answers he freely offers total strangers, a truly wonderful trait; I expect you will find even his answer unsatisfactory.  So I'll offer this...\n\nScripture is inspired by God.  ---By Faith---  You see, it's totally possible a person who never communicates with God to stumble upon a Bible and find it utterly ridiculous.  This is, I believe, because he is a natural (you know, naturalism, looking for only natural explanations to physical phenomenon) man who has never applied himself to study of the spiritual realm.  However, a person who takes the basic knowledge of God's existence which God gives every man and spends his life learning more about God will make very much use of Faith-the human means of communication with the divine.  In the end, of the two people, the natural and spiritual, the spiritual will be ""inspired"" or ""revealed"" to know much more than the natural will ""discover,"" because the spiritual will have learned how to commune with His creator, which he will continue to do throughout all eternity.\nSo, to summarize learn all you can in school.  Study all the hard sciences and make ""discoveries,"" but more importantly, spend much time in prayer, in nature, in scripture reading, and allow the Lord to ""reveal"" to you.  In the end your ""inspirations"" from God will be infinitely more valuable than your ""discoveries"" in nature.  \nOh, and don't worry, they won't be in disagreement in the end.  Does that help?\nGod bless!\nGood question!\nThis is an Orthodox Christian response."

It's not a disco or a bar, fer cryin out loud! Wear the nicest clothes that you have. Even if the best you can manage is a t-shirt and jeans, make sure that you are as clean and neat as possible - but GO!\n\nPersonally, I do not think that women should be required to cover their heads. When men are in a place of worship their minds should be on worship, not the desirability of the women, however they are dressed. That is the men's responsibility, not the women's, in my opinion!"

"1","Why do adults fall through what others tell them?","A single mother of 2, 12 yr old and 11 yr old, is dating a 50 yr old single man. The man smokes and drinks a lot while under pressure. He tells the woman to do so and she does. She does whatever the man tells her to. She gets off from work everyday to stay a few hours at the man's house before going home to cook for the kids. She talks to him more than with her kids. The man tells her that kids are nothing but problems and that is why he never have kids. The woman believe him and regret having kids. Why do adults in her 40s have to fall through what other tell them without using their own judgement on what's right and what's wrong?","by the age of 40 she should really know her own mind, she is a mature adult not an impressionable child.  it's likely all of her relationships have been like this, she must be submissive, maybe she has never had a relationship where she felt able to have an opinion or express how she feels.\nBut to regret having children just because this man has given her that idea is out of order, it must be hurtful for the children as well.  She needs to grow up and get rid of him.

"1","whats inri stand for on the cross?","","IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM\n\nSince anyone who would actually see the paintings of the Crucifixion in the Middle Ages (inside a Church) would then already be familiar with the phrase (in Latin), the painters all apparently chose to simplify their paintings by only including the initials of the four Latin words, I N R I. The early Church had also apparently used that abbreviation.\n\nLuke 23:38 also mentions the sign on the Cross, and he mentions that the sign was written in three languages, Greek, Latin and Hebrew. Scholars then chose to follow the wording presented in John, as it is more complete by including the reference to Nazareth, and as it might be presenting the Latin version of the text on the Cross. In all three languages the first word was Jesus, but since Greek and Hebrew don't use the letter J, His Name was spelled beginning with an I. The Roman (Latin) spelling followed that, (IESVS) even though their language included a J. The second word represented Nazareth, or Nazarene, N. The third word represented king, which in Latin (REX) begins with an R. The fourth word represented Jews, (IVDAEORVM) again spelled beginning with an I. You can see that the INRI then says ""Jesus Nazareth King Jews""."

Even in the first few centuries in American history, the ""great melting pot"" of cultures and religions, monotheism was the only acceptable form of religion. It has only been in the last 80-100 years that polytheists have been recognized and accepted into the mainstream of western society. \n\nIt took Christianity some 300 years to gain acceptance as a valid religion. Considering that, polytheism is making a pretty effective comeback into society. \n\n-SD-"

Avoid short answers like ""much better"". I understand it can only be unscientific guesswork, but the question looks interesting for me nevertheless.","Prior to revelation at Sinai, there were no ethical/moral laws.  Each group of people were governed by their own God, pharoah, king, etc. and were at his/her/its mercy.  \nAfter revelation at Sinai, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for 40 years as they learned to live in ""freedom"" with God and His laws as a guide.  Since the Israelites had never lived in freedom, they were doomed to wander in the wilderness until their children became of age and were able to function as a free people under God, their king, in the promised land.\nIn the promised land, everyone was held accountable to God's law -- especially the leaders.  It was a duty and privilege for everyone to study Torah, learn the law, and to assure that everyone received equal treatment under God's law.  Because everyone studied the law, the Levites could not invent and change laws willy-nilly.  They were accountable to God just the same as the lowly sheperd.\nOver time, God's laws have been adopted by other nations and justice for all has prevailed in some countries.\nWithout the laws of the Torah, insane leaders could commit monstrous acts of violence and atrocities without consequences.  Men could kill women and children simply from a fit of anger.  Everyone would live in constant terror not knowing from where the next threat would come.\nIn essence, we owe our freedom from terror to the words of wisdom found in this wonderful book we call our Bible!  \nIn today's world of terrorism, it makes one wonder how those words have become so distorted."

Nowhere does the Bible talk about itself. Some scriptures are sometimes pointed to in the Bible, say: Here where it talks about itself, but we have to look closely. 2nd Timothy 3:16 is the favourite which reads: “All scripture is inspired of God” and there are those who would say, here is where the Bible it talks about itself, it says it is inspired of God, all of it. But if you read the whole sentence, you read that this was a letter wrote by Paul to Timothy and the entire sentence says to Timothy: “Since you were a young man you have studied the holy scriptures, all scriptures inspired by God” and so on… When Timothy was a young man the New Testament did not exist, the only thing that stems he was talking about are scriptures – which are only a portion of the Bible - from before that time. It could not have meant the whole Bible.\n**PLEASE,give REASONABLE ARGUMENT","You are correct that the word Bible is not in the Bible.  I believe Bible is Latin for The Book.  Christian scripture that Paul was referencing was specific to the Old Testament because the New Testament didn't exist yet.  \n\nThe Old Testament become considered ""Bible"" when Jewish scholars selected the books to be included because of their consistency, historical accuracy, and spiritual quality. \n\nThe New Testament books included in the Bible were chosen by the early church around 300 A.D. for their consistency, historical accuracy, and spiritual quality as well.  \n\nIf you read the bible and compare it to other books that were not included by the Jewish or Christian scholars, i.e. the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, it will be easy to see why most of them were not included in the Bible."

My father taught me better than that.  If it's a place where you have to put a quarter in to take a cart out, I find someone to give it to and I don't let them give me their quarter.  Otherwise I usually drop it in the buggy holder, and I'll take an abandoned one along with me if it's nearby."
"1","WHY OH WHY Do people blatantly throw their cigarettes butts down on the ground , sometimes right at your feet?","it is bewildering to me how people can still do this and how it is overlooked by the authorities . what do you think about this subject and what could I do as an Individual to inspire my government to stop these people from this micro toxic litter ( that is MOST disgusting ) ????","Probably for the same reasons people throw pop cans, beer cans, dirty diapers, food wrappers etc. on the ground..........because they are lazy or because there was no other place to put the cigarette butt. As far as the dangers involved in cigarette smoke, people have more to worry about as far as factory emissions and vehicle emissions than they do from a cigarette. Smoke rises! Go into a smoker's house and see where the stains from the cigarette smoke is found. It is found at the ceiling level. There are also more health risks from people urinating outside or pets urinating outside, than there are from a cigarette butt left on the ground. As far as the toxins from the cigarette leeching into the ground or getting into our water supply, the risks are far smaller than the chemicals that people use in their gardens and vehicles every day. I would be willing to bet that there are just as many beer cans and alcohol bottles thrown down on the ground each day as cigarette butts.  Look around and you will notice ALL the trash that is thrown down. It's disgusting no matter what the litter happens to be. Personally, I find it disgusting to see parents toss their child's dirty diaper onto the ground, just so they don't have to ride home in their car with the smelly diaper! They chose to have the child and anything that comes out of that child belongs to them! I hate when people allow their pets to roam around and use parks, other people's yards etc. for their bathroom. That is MOST disgusting!  I do have a concern about cigarette butts though, the cigarette butt can be toxic to children and animals, and a lit cigarette carries the danger of starting a fire. For those reasons I wish people wouldn't throw their cigarette butts on the ground and out their car windows. Littering of ANY kind is wrong and should carry a stiff fine. Unfortunately very few people who litter (any kind of litter) get caught. The reason it is overlooked by authorities is for the same reason other littering is overlooked. There just isn't enough manpower to deal with the situation. Police have more important things to deal with than drive around looking for litterbugs. I do think targeting one group of people for littering is wrong. If you want to protest against ALL littering that is fine, but to just have a problem with cigarette butts is ridiculous. The littering problem is not just cigarette butts. ALL littering needs to be stopped.\n\n\nResponse\n\nThank you Kenlas, I wasn't trying to say that there was no smoke down lower. People talk about the danger of second hand smoke even when they are outside. My point was that the little trail of smoke from a cigarette in comparison to everything the factories and vehicles spew out every day would not really be much of an issue. The majority of cigarette smoke rises almost immediately, leaving very little for others to be concerned about. I was using the ceiling in a smoker's house as an example of smoke rising. People want to believe that smoking and second hand smoke are the only causes of lung cancer, but researchers have NO way of proving that people who have never smoked developed lung cancer from second hand smoke. When they do their so called tests, they use HIGHLY concentrated amounts of cigarette smoke to try and prove their case. They know that the factories and vehicles spew out the same and worse toxins, in far larger quantities, than a cigarette, but because of the expense of forcing those two things to be made safer, they choose to ignore them for the most part and concentrate on a relatively small part of the population. Plus they can pass bills to outrageously raise taxes on cigarettes to help generate money whenever they need more money. I haven't seen them raising taxes on ALL alcohol to help generate more money, even though hundreds of people die due to drunk drivers each year. I don't see them banning alcohol in all public places to help reduce the amount"

For instance, if you want to know what limits people think should be in place in regards to freedom of speech, you would think of questions that measure this more specifically. For instance: Do you feel that the freedom of speech applies to all people? Do you feel it applies to all types of speech? Do you feel that there should be rules regulating people's speech. You might also make a list of potential situations that people might think that free speech should be protected or regulated (Racial slurs, hate speech, threatening language, opposition to government officials, etc...).  You just have to make sure that your questions all answer your big questions and that you can measure your survey afterwards."

If you don't tell her, it could be something that you will regret and will eat away at you, and from what you have said it is already really bothering you. Even though it could alter your friendship, you can't keep acting that you are only interested in her as a friend. Since you care about her so much to memorize a speech for her I don't think it is something that you can keep from her much longer, so go ahead and tell her. She has already told you that she is both a lesbian and bi, so I don't know how interested she will be but at least you will have told her and not keep asking yourself why you haven't done so yet."

Religion is a huge part of modern society, and to be ignorant of (or worse, prejudiced about!) it is to lack understanding of a key factor in today's world.  You just can't fully understand events in Iran, Saudi Arabia, India, England, Tibet, Israel, France, Norway, the United States, or a myriad of other nations if you don't understand religion.  As for which religions should be taught, it should naturally be all the major ones, not just Christianity."

This is perfectly understandable,but if they only looked to the Bible to find the truth they would see the very real reasons for everything mankind is struggling with right now. When you dont have God, life is shallow, vain and shortlived,the world is a cold place, and God has put in place provisions for all of us to get out.

(I'm going to assume we are specifically referring to the God of the Christian/Jewish Bible).\n\nNow I realize that the reasons people choose to deny God not only depends on age, sex, and race, but also on the era and culture they grow up in. I will list some of the more practical and common reasons why I personally believe people today deny God referring specifically to people in America.\n\n1. Most people just don't care. It's true, most people don't care about the issue of God. They care more about their current needs and problems such as earning money, feeding their children, and surviving. So these types of people don't really care about belief in God because they don't see how having that ""belief"" will put food on the table.\n\n2. A lot of people grew up in traditional Catholic homes where the parents were harsh and strict and beat ""religion"" into their kids (not physically) and sternly commanded strict adherence to ""no sex,"" ""go to Church,"" ""do this and don't do that."" Of course when the children got old enough they completely rebelled, ditched Church, immediately started having lots of sex, hated religion, and cared only about the pleasures of this life. A further problem is that the parents teach the children to adhere and practice certain traditions without telling the children the meaning or importance of them. Naturally the children grow up believing these Church traditions are meaningless and useless and are angry that they had to follow them when they were younger. These types of people have felt “repressed” by religion for so long that they want little or nothing to do with it.\n\n3. Self-denial and the art of philosophy. A lot of people whether consciously or subconsciously deny that God exists and use lots of excuses to validate their denial. This is of course the position the NT holds in reference to how people willfully choose to deny God even though He clearly manifests Himself in the things that are seen (the intricate order of the universe, earth, life itself). They may choose to deny God by claiming that, “nothing is real,” “nothing can be proven,” “we can’t really tell if we even exist,” etc. You get the idea. Before anyone believes in God, for one reason or another they fall into this category, meaning that everyone has “inwardly” chosen rebellion and denial of God when we truly “know better.” This position only makes sense to those that are believers. These types of people deny God’s existence based on the fact that since we can never truly know what’s real or not, then nothing truly matters, including God.\n\n4. Sin is fun. If it wasn't people wouldn't do it. People like the temporary (and fleeting) high of sin. They of course gloss over and choose to deny the inevitable consequences (death, suffering, pain, etc.). But regardless, sin is quite tempting and it pays off (if only temporarily) and believing in God would mean they'd have to stop. Who would want to do that? These types of people reject God because everything He’s against feels too good to give up.\n\n5. Pop-culture. ""Rational,"" ""civilized,"" and ""educated"" minds have persuaded our culture, which inevitably persuaded our media, (which in turn persuaded our culture even more), that there is no absolute right or wrong, and that all of us are free to do what we ""feel"" is right and wrong. Once you take away absolute right and wrong God becomes a rather huge contradiction, and no one likes believing in a contradiction. Many religions are seen as “intolerant” and therefore are “narrow-minded.” If there are no absolutes, then God is not ""the"" truth. All religions are “up-for-grabs,” anything can be believed in whether it be paganism, the occult, philosophy, humanism, etc. Anything can be the truth, and th"

Does he killed ?\n How he killed if he is the god? who his father is ?\nif he is the son of God why he is a human?\nmany question ?!!\nwhat is the clear story ????????","Jesus (8-2 BC/BCE– 29-36 AD/CE),[1] also known as Jesus of Nazareth, is the central figure of Christianity. In this context, he is known as Jesus Christ, where Christ is a Greek title meaning ""Anointed"", corresponding to the Hebrew term ""Messiah"".\n\nThe main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Most scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that Jesus was a Jewish teacher from Galilee who was regarded as a healer, was baptized by John the Baptist, was accused of sedition against the Roman Empire, and on the orders of Roman Governor Pontius Pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion.[2] As the Gospels were not written immediately after his death and there is little external documentation, a small minority of scholars question the historical existence of Jesus.[3]\n\nChristian views of Jesus (known as Christology) are both diverse and complex. Most Christians are Trinitarian and believe that Jesus is simultaneously the Son of God and God made incarnate, sent to provide salvation and reconciliation with God by atoning for the sins of humanity. Nontrinitarian Christians adopt various other interpretations regarding the divinity of Jesus. Most Christians believe that Jesus was born of a virgin, crucified and buried in a tomb[4], resurrected on the third day of death, and ascended into Heaven where he resides with God the Father until the Second Coming. Most Christians also believe that Jesus performed miracles and fulfilled biblical prophecy.\n\nIn Islam, Jesus (Arabic Isa) is considered one of God's most beloved and important prophets, a bringer of divine scripture, and also the Messiah. Muslims, however, do not share the Christian belief in the crucifixion or divinity of Jesus. Islam teaches that Jesus is alive in heaven and will return to the earth as Messiah in the company of the Mahdi once the earth has become full of sin and injustice.\n\nThe most detailed accounts of Jesus' birth are contained in the Gospel of Matthew (probably written between 65 and 90 AD/CE)[5] and the Gospel of Luke (probably written between 65 and 100 AD/CE).[6] There is considerable debate about the details of Jesus' birth even among Christian scholars, and few scholars claim to know either the year or the date of his birth or of his death. Based on the accounts in the Gospels of the shepherds' activities, the time of year depicted for Jesus' birth could be spring or summer. However, as early as 354, according to Origen, Roman Christians celebrated it following the December solstice in an attempt to replace the Roman festival of Saturnalia (or more specifically, Sol Invictus). Before then, Jesus' birth was generally celebrated on January 6 as part of the feast of Theophany, also known as Epiphany, which commemorated not only Jesus' birth but also his baptism by John in the Jordan River and possibly additional events in Jesus' life. The traditional date of Jesus' birth is celebrated as Christmas.\n\nIn the 248th year of the Diocletian Era (based on Diocletian's ascension to the Roman throne), Dionysius Exiguus attempted to pinpoint the number of years since Jesus' birth, arriving at a figure of 753 years after the founding of Rome. Dionysius then set Jesus' birth as being December 25 1 ACN (for ""Ante Christum Natum"", or ""before the birth of Christ""), and assigned AD 1 to the following year — thereby establishing the system of numbering years from the birth of Jesus: Anno Domini (which translates as ""in the year of our Lord""). This system made the then current year 532, and almost two centuries later it won acceptance and became the established calendar in Western civilization due to its championing by the Venerable Bede.\n\nHowever, based on a lunar eclipse that Josephus reports shortly before the death of Herod the Great (w"

Ultimately when their Mahdi arrives - he is supposed to lead them in forced conversion to Islam and killing all who refuse so that Islam is only religion in the world.\n\nCurrently you have Bin Laden, also the President of Iran and Hamas leadership, among others that are bucking for the position as Mahdi. Keep your eyes on the Iranian President.., he may end up winning. Non the less, Global force is their ultimate dream to total Islam.\n\nSupposedly this ushers in global peace, but the facts are they fight among their own-selves, do honor killings (making false accusations to get rid of a wife or bothersome relative).. and on and on and on.

He chooses to enter the debate of God/gods but ""must"" does not apply.  Belief in nothing is not a belief system, but trying to disprove faith becomes an avocation.\n\nAgnostics would seem to me to be more engaged in a inner dialogue of an existence of a higher power.

"1","What do you do if you've been fired from a job & your ex-co-worker still calls you and asks you for help?","I was fired in April of 2006, and part of the reason I was fired was because I kept covering for a co-worker (the team secretary) and I was unable to get some of my projects completed in enough time to please my boss...

Specifically, stuff that the IT people should be able to answer, and she asks, saying ""I know you don't work here anymore, but -on the basis of our friendship- I was hoping you could help me.""

The way you handle this varies on your friendship with her. It will not be easy, particularly if you covered for her in the past.

So based on what I've read and come to believe all ""souls"" come from an unconscious God state and are actually an individual mind of God on a journey of consciousness veiled by the bubble of illusion (our existence).  This is a continuous, infinite process from what I understand.  Meaning ""new souls"" are continually coming from the original God state.  The individual ""soul"" goes through the process of evolution of forms until it reaches the human form.  So there are some humans that have never been human before but they have had millions of life times and probably in their last life they were a dog.  Then the ""soul"" goes through the process of reincarnation of human forms because of karmic debt, etc."

With a long militarist tradition, Japan became extremely militarist and aggressive in the 1930s and was practically governed by military leaders. Tojo, an aggressive army General, became minister of war in July 1941 and prime minister in October 1941. After a short attempt to improve relations with the US failed, he ordered to go to war and attack Pearl Harbor in December 1941. He gradually took more ministerial roles, and in Feb. 1944 also made himself the commander in chief, like Adolf Hitler did. When he realized that Japan was going to lose the war he resigned. The military continued to control Japan until the end of World War 2, which came when the Emperor Hirohito which was until then passive, ordered to surrender in order to prevent further inevitable destruction of Japan. After the war Tojo was executed for his responsibility to Japan's war crimes. \nBenito Mussolini, was the prime minister of Italy (1922-1943). A former journalist, he went to politics and formed the Fascist party, whose ideology, Fascism, called for a one-party state, total obedience, patriotic nationalism, and aggressive militarism. The ideology and its implementation in Mussolini's Italy influenced Adolf Hitler's own ideology, Nazism, which was a combination of Fascism with extreme racism. Initially Mussolini led a right-wing coalition, but later Italy became a one party state. His treatment of unemployment made Mussolini popular, but the military aggression of Fascism led to its failure. Mussolini was eager to demonstrate the ""strength"" of his regime by invading weaker neighbors. In 1935 he invaded and occupied the peaceful Ethiopia from Italy's nearby colony in East Africa. In 1936, the two Fascist dictators, Hitler and Mussolini, signed an alliance. In 1939 he invaded and occupied his small neighbor Albania, and Mussolini then enhanced his alliance with Hitler to a full military alliance. Mussolini knew that his military was not very effective, but when the Germans defeated the French and British forces in mid 1940 he thought it was safe enough for him to attack Britain and the collapsing France too and declared war, and in October 1940 he also invaded Greece, and was repelled. Mussolini had a million soldiers in Libya, and he sent them to attack the small British force in Egypt. The Italian Navy and Air Force attacked British ports and shipping in the Mediterranean, from Gibraltar in the West to Haifa (Israel) in the East. Despite its numerical strength and the fact that British forces in the Mediterranean were greatly outnumbered and very stretched, the Italian military could not defeat them anywhere, and was severely beaten by the British, and simply had to call for the help of the much more capable Germans. Even with German help, the British forces only lost their positions in Greece and kept fighting fiercely from their island bases in Malta, Gibraltar, and in North Africa. Mussolini's Italy became a German puppet, and even sent troops to participate in Germany's invasion of Russia. Eventually, British and American forces eliminated the Italian and German forces in North Africa and followed in July 1943 with an invasion of Sicily in South Italy. It was clear that Italy was losing the war, so several days after the invasion Mussolini was replaced and arrested in a remote mountain castle. Hitler sent commandos to rescue his friend from captivity. In April 1945, when German defence in North Italy collapsed, Mussolini was captured by Italian partisans and executed . \nThe defenders\nWinston Churchill kept warning of the Nazi danger in pre-war years. He was elected prime minister of Great Britain after the total collapse of the appeasement policy of his predecessor Neville Chamberlain. Chamberlain failed to understa"

Latin is the ancestor of about 20 modern languages of Europe and Greek is just the ancestor of Modern Greek.  Old Chinese is the ancestor of the half dozen Chinese languages.

"1","Is this adultery?","if I often think about having sex with my engaged one... we never do it-- we're saving it for marriage. It doesn't feel wrong when I think about it, but I just wondered if it was adulterous. Please be practical if you are going to use theology. Thanks.","Jesus said that to look after a woman to lust you've already committed adultery with her in your heart.  The point of this is that Christ is more interested in what we are rather than what we do.  In other words, if its wrong to do a particular thing, it is wrong to fantasize about doing it, because whatever is in a person's  heart is what will flow out of him or her and defines him or her.  The practical side of this is, God knows how strong sexual desires are.  They have th power to drown out everything else.  They can reach a fever pitch almost instantly.  However, they are the weakest of all the qualities in a relationship to hold it together through the trials of life and ultimately, old age, sickness, and death.  That's why you need to cool the flame of sexual energy to allow the foundation to form that will carry you two together for life; love him for the person he is, the friend that he is.  Let sex (after marriage) spring from a beautiful union that has already grown and matured and as a special bonus.  God came up with the idea of sex, but He hates to see a great thing spoiled.  That's why He has rules for things; not to kill our fun, but for our good.  If sex is the foundation it will wither away.  Lastly, give your heart to Christ (if you haven't already) and call out His name for help when this becomes impossible because you can't do this in your own strength."

In actuality, nowhere is the bible is ""Alpha and Omega"" mentioned as dying.\n\nThe oldest Greek manuscripts, such as Alexandrine, Sinaitic, and Codex Ephraemi rescriptus, show that the KJV's use of the term at Revelation 1:11 is spurious. A small handful of other translations dishonestly insert the name ""Jesus"" at Rev 22:12 or Rev 22:13 but secular scholars unanimously agree that the most reliable ancient manuscripts never had Jesus' name there. Revelation 22:13 discussed Jehovah the Father.\n\nIn contrast to the Greek philosophy, pagan tradition, dishonest scholarship, and tortured ""logic"" of trinitarianism, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Scriptures alone quite plainly demonstrate that Jesus and the Almighty are separate distinct persons, and the Almighty created Jesus as His firstborn son.\n\n(Colossians 1:15) the firstborn of all creation\n\n(Mark 10:18) Jesus said to him: 'Why do you call me good?

They simply do not hear you when you point out that it's a pile, no, a truckload, nay, a Matterhorn of horse-hockey.  These same people retain enough sense to enable them to pass their drivers' license tests; to get and hold jobs; to raise children who stay out of prison (the majority of them, at any rate).  \n\nAnd they never notice the contradiction, they never notice that their own brains are divided against them.

"1","Why do churches have their windows up high and covered in stain glass?  Is it so no one can see in or out?","There have been some recent questions about why many JW Kingdom Halls don't have windows.  That got me to thinking, so tonight, as I drove 250 miles around Kansas City, I checked out every church I passed.  I noticed that all of them had windows, but they were up high and covered in stain glass.  Many respondents to the previous questions about Kingdom Halls said that it was because JWs didn't want anyone seeing what went on inside, well the same can be claimed for any church.  In fact, a lot of churches do have things to hide, as has become evident by the number of claims made of child sexual abuse.  I wonder how many churches are as open to inspection as a Kingdom Hall, such as places where children can be taken advantage of?  In Kingdom Halls, the children are not segregated from the parents to where they can be harmed.  Is this what other churches are hiding?","Stained glass is also called ""artwork""; it falls in the same category as sculptures and paintings and frescoes, etc. It is not intended to hide anything, just there to be pretty and inspire those who look at it.\n\nSin, like molesting children, is not hidden by glass, stained or otherwise. Neither is it hidden by walls of concrete, wood, plaster, or steel. It is hidden by people of corrupt mind and heart, buried behind a life of false pretences and lies and slick showmanship. \n\nWe have had child molesting ""preachers"" in my town also.

"1","I'm a married woman, with a crush on my gay male friend....?","I'm married female newlywed, and have a few gay male friends with whom I go out to dance clubs every now and again. One in particular I fear I have a crush on. He is very affectionate with me and we get along but he is totally 100% gay. After each time we meet I am fantasizing about him for 2-3 days later. I've let him kiss me and dance very close with me, both things I don't think hubby would like. I get a lot of enjoyment from the affection from my friend yet sometimes rationalize it saying its all in good fun, he doesn't get anything out of it and it ""doesn't count"". But I do feel guilty bc I do get pleasure from it, love his kisses and know that my husband would not like it if another man kissed me, gay or straight. Tables turned I wouldnt like it either. I'm just so starved for affection, tho. Hubby never has sex with me.. he's just turned off or something. \n\nHelp!","I would imagine that part of why you guys are so close is that there is little chance of anything happening between you.  You are married, he is gay.  There is a line between you that keeps you honest.  \n\nI have always been more flirtatious with women who are attached because I didn't feel anything for them and I knew that they didn't feel anything for me.  I didn't have anything to worry about.  When I was with a woman who I had feelings for, I acted differently, didn't want to make too big a fool out of myself.\n\nYou may want to work on strengthening things with your husband.  Try flirting with him, like before you were married.  Surprise him with a romantic candlelit dinner one evening.  Maybe you can turn things around on the home front"

"1","In the Kaballah, the statement ""God counts the tears of women"",how would you interpret this?","","This may be a long answer. \n\nThe Kabballah says that women are on a higher spiritual plane than men.  The reason is because they have a womb.  When God decided to create the universe, at first he couldn't.  HE filled everything.  So he had to essentially rip a hole in his own being and create a void in the middle of himself.  He then gave birth to the whole universe in the void he had torn in himself.\n\nThe womb of a woman is like this.  It is a void in the middle of her being that gives birth to new little realities.  A mother gets to watch her child grow up and grow old.  She sees the joys and pains of the child all the way until her own death.  When they cry, she cries.  When they hurt, she cries.  When they succeed, she cries.  So the reason that god counts the tears of women is because they are like his own tears.  HE counts them to see the love and care and concern she had for her offspring, just as he has cried for his so many times"

I am sickened by true terrorism where innocent people are killed as we are taught if you kill one innocent person it is as if you have killed all of man kind.

"1","Dreamcatchers..?","I know they catch dreams or they wouldn't have that name,I know the ones I have seen are extremely beautiful,but what is the history behind them and what is it that they do besides the obvious if anything?","The history of the dream catcher has nearly been lost in the turmoil of cultural mixing and destruction that followed on the heels of the European invasion.  Dreamcatcher history is known with some credibility due to the dedicated field work of Frances Densmore at the beginning of the last century.  She conducted a careful and extensive study of many Native American cultures including that of the Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa) living in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, Canada. A simple description can be found in her book, Chippewa Customs, published by the Minnesota Historical Society Press (St. Paul) in 1929 and reprinted in 1979.  She described articles looking like spider webs that were usually hung from the hoop of a child's cradle board.  She said that 'they catch and hold everything evil as a spider's web catches and holds everything that comes into contact with it'. These 'dream catchers' were wooden hoops with a 3 1/2 in. diameter, woven with a web made of nettle-stalk fiber that was dyed red with the red sap of the root of bloodroot or the inner bark of the wild plum tree.   A facsimile of this traditional dream catcher can be seen at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in central Minnesota.  The spider web dream catcher shown at the left is very similar to the original dream catcher that has been a tradition for a  very long time.  In our dream catcher weaving kits you can find the materials and instructions for weaving this classic gift for the newborn.\n\nThe common dream catcher weave seen today is the traditional weave used for other articles, most commonly the hoop for the hoop and stick game of many tribes. Woven with strong rawhide with a hole in the center, a child would roll the hoop along the ground and another would try to throw a wooden spear through the hole in the center.  Stories of the dream catcher legend that describe the dreams going through a center hole are of recent origin.  The original dream catcher had a very tiny hole in the center and the legend describes ALL dreams being caught in the weaving.\n\nFor many years, only Ojibwe people made dream catchers as each tribe made only its original crafts.  In the mid 70’s, dream catcher earrings became popular and many people of other tribes began to make dream catchers.  Not knowing how to weave the spider web or not wanting to take the extra time needed they chose the mid-point weaving style of the hoop and stick instead of the end-point weave of the ancient spider web.  Many people, not knowing the significance of the twig or not being able to find the beautiful red willow of the northern woodlands, began to use metal rings wound with leather or string.  The thread of tradition was lost.  Now in the time of the Seventh Fire, the traditions are being returned to the people.  \nEach tribe and clan, however, has its own oral tradition and memory.  Passing along that memory by storytelling has not been easy with the traditional culture challenged, the tribal languages fallen into disuse, and poverty, drugs, and conflicting values have created a climate of fear, anger, despair, and confusion.  Now there are many legends of the dreamcatcher from many different Native American cultures.  Sometimes Anishinabe tell the story of the Lakota dreamcatcher with the ""Shinob"" traditional spider web, and Lakota tell the ""Shinob"" story with their ""Lakota"" dreamcatcher.  Authenticity is difficult, if not impossible, given the intermarriage among many tribes, with non-Indians, and the loss of the continuity historically provided by traditional elders.  I have encountered a few traditional elders who wanted to learn how to weave the dreamcatcher but they could find no one in their community who would or could teach them how to weave the ancient designs of their culture.  They had come to me.  \n\nIn 1996 I taught Ojibwe people at the Rediscovery Center on t"

"1","Do you think that Jesus is the REAL son of GOD? and what evidence do you have?","","Jesus in Islam\nIslam is a religion which requires belief in not only the Prophethood of Muhammad but all the prophets of God, including Jesus (Qur'an 2:137).\nThe Holy book of Islam, the Quran, relates in detail the story of Jesus, including his birth, mission as a Prophet to the Israelites, and his crucifixion. Muslims believe that this story is in harmony with the Bible too. Indeed, a whole chapter in the Qur'an is named after the mother of Jesus (Chapter 19 - Maryam).\n\nDivinity of Jesus\nIslam presents Jesus as a human who believed in the absolute Unity and Indivisibility of God (Qur'an 3:52). \n\nMuslims consider the doctrine of Divinity of Jesus and Trinity as later changes to the teachings of Jesus. The New Testament itself furnishes abundant evidence to show that Jesus was only a human being whom God chose for the reformation of His people, and repeatedly contradicts the Divinity of Jesus. Jesus always referred to himself as having been sent by God (John 17:3) and his followers, too, considered him a man approved by God (Qur'an 19:37; Acts 2:22, John 3:2). \n\nHe was undoubtedly called the son of God, but this title has only been employed metaphorically and in fact is used for all the chosen ones of God (Matt 5:9, Exodus 4:22). The literal connotation of 'son of God' as a Divine Being and hence the subsequent development of Trinity Dogma was the result of Hellenistic influences on Christianity as it spread in the Gentile world. The Semitic usage of 'son of God' was misunderstood and forgotten and disputes about the exact status of Jesus erupted, as recorded in the early Church history. \n\nJesus prayed to God like all other God-fearing individuals (Luke 5:16), and engaged in spiritual exercises such as fasting (Matt 4:2). Furthermore, Jesus lacked knowledge of the future (Mark 13:32), as only the Divine Being possesses perfect and complete knowledge."

If I died a stillborn does it still count. Is being born a sin in it's self? I don't get it.","simple answer:\n\nbecause he loves you\n\nExtended answer:\n\nThe first issue revolves around the perfection in God's creation. Some Bible students believe the Genesis account teaches perfection only in Eden. Outside the bounds of paradise there was a fallen world with death and destruction. Sin had entered the universe through the fall of Satan and the earth was subject to his dominion. If the Devil had already sinned before Adam and Eve, then evil had already been brought into the universe. Adam's sin, therefore would affect only the earth, not the heavens. Some Bible commentators want to restrict Adam's sin to Eden - the small plot of ground on the earth that had not been tainted by sin. \n\nScripture says Christ’s death was part of God’s eternal purpose.\n\nThen I said, ‘Here I am - it is written about me in the scroll - I have come to do your will, O God.” First he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them” (although the law required them to be made). Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all (Hebrews 10:7-\n\nJesus Paid The Penalty For Sin\n\nThe death of Christ was the payment for sin—the ransom paid to God to satisfy His holy demands. The Bible pictures humans as sinners who had rebelled against God. Christ’s death on the cross paid the penalty for the sin of humankind. Jesus died in our place as our substitute, receiving the punishment that was due us.\n\nThe Bible says.\n\n[Jesus Christ] was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification (Romans 4:25).\n\nThe writer to the Hebrews declared.\n\nSo Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many (Hebrews 9:28).\n\nThe penalty that Jesus paid for sin was not only for the human race; it was also for everything in the universe that had been marred by sin.\n\nBecause the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God (Romans 8:21).\n\nThe demands of a holy God were satisfied by Jesus’ death on the cross."

These self same supernatural affinities could and often would resort to astound the less endowed ""mortals"" thus holding the mankind in a state of bewildered subjugation.  The condition was nothing short of a psychological tyranny.  Odysseus, as a man, could effect events and meet challenges with nothing more than the innate mortal qualities of intellect, sagacity and virtue.  He demonstrated that 'man' by sheer force of will with the employment of virtue could also shape events thus having a dramatic impact upon the life's course.

""Sex, for a Christian, is the order given by God in the first chapter of the Bible, just after the creation of male and female, his very first commandment was: ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth"" (Gen.1:28). The Bible talks with respect and dignity about sex, for the purpose of having children, and always to take place in the context of marriage.\n\nThe Bible is silent on physical techniques of sexual intercourse, but it is very clear that all sex activity have to end with intercourse to have the chance of fertilization. Any sexual activity which does not end in intercourse is immoral and forbidden, be it oral or anal sex, or masturbation. Any kind of homosexuality is actually a form of masturbation, which is the act of having ejaculation or sexual pleasure without intercourse.

And I believe Cannon is a section of the church as well.  Where did this word come from and what does it mean in a religious context?","'Canon,' in this context, comes from a word meaning 'measuring rod.' It refers to the books which are recognized as being the Word of God.\n\nFor Old Testament books, they were not accepted unless people knew that they were written by a prophet.  Most books of the Old Testament have a connection to the book before them; this is known as the colophon principle.  Many of the apocryphal books in Catholic bibles were never accepted by the Jews of the time, but were added centuries later.\n\nFor New Testament books, they were not accepted unless they were written by an apostle or by a close traveling companion of an apostle (ie, Mark and Luke).\n\nAs far as the Catholic church goes, they have their 'canon law,' which they define as ""the name attached to that body of rules or laws for the direction of all faithful in matters of faith and conduct.""  It is their laws which they have added to the Bible.\n\nAs far as a 'section of the church,' I assume you mean a church building; in classical architecture, the chancel is the area where the people sit."

She was not allowed to adopt a successor after his death by the British, and Jhansi was annexed. \nWith the outbreak of the Revolt she became determined to fight back. She used to go into the battlefield dressed as a man. Holding the reins of there horse in her mouth she used the sword with both hands. Under her leadership the Rani's troops showed undaunted courage and returned shot for shot. Considered by the British as the best and bravest military leader of rebels this sparkling epitome of courage died a hero's death in the battlefield. \nThe first name that comes to mind is that of the famous Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi. Dressed in men’s clothes, she led her soldiers to war against the British. Even her enemies admired her courage and daring. She fought valiantly and although beaten she refused to surrender and fell as a warrior should, fighting the enemy to the last.

His response to her fiery speech brought into her life the impact of a visionary who saw in her oratory and brilliance a leader of the future. \n\nThe period from 1917 to 1919 was the most dynamic phase of Sarojini's career. During this time, she campaigned for the Montagu Chelmsford Reforms, the Khilafat issue, the draconian Rowlett Act and the Satyagraha. When Gandhi launched the Civil Disobedience Movement ,she proved a faithful lieutenant. With great courage she quelled the rioters, sold proscribed literature, addressed frenzied meetings on the carnage at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar.In 1930 when Mahatma Gandhi chose her to lead the Salt Satyagraha the stories of her courage became legion. After Gandhi's arrest she had prepared 2,000 volunteers under the scorching sun to raid the Dahrsana Salt Works, while the police faced them half a mile up the road with rifle, lathis (canes) are steel tipped clubs. The volunteers wildly cheered when she shook off the arm of the British police officer who came to arrest her and marched proudly to the barbed wire stockade where she was interned before being imprisoned. Freedom struggle was in full force and she came under the influence of Gopalakrishna Gokhale  and Gandhi. Gokhale advised her to spare all her energy and talents for nation's cause. She gave up writing poetry and fully devoted herself to emancipation of women, education, Hindu-Muslim unity etc. She became a follower of Gandhiji and accompanied him to England. Whenever in England, she openly criticized British rule in India which caught the attention of scholars and intellectuals. \n  \n3.KASTURBA GANDHI \nKasturba Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi's wife joined her husband while he was in South Africa and worked with him for many years there. She was a leader of Women's Satyagraha for which she was imprisoned. She helped her husband in the cause of Indigo workers in Champaran, Bihar and the No Tax Campaign in Kaira, Gujarat. She was arrested twice for picketing liquor and foreign cloth shops, and in 1939 for participating in the Rajkot Satyagraha. \n  \n4.ARUN ASAF ALI \nArun Asaf Ali, a radical nationalist played an outstanding role in the historic Quit India Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi on August 9, 194"

"1","Do you agree with the arguements the book ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" presents?","","Not really, it seems a desperate move to start moving letters around to fit a predetermined theory. The original grail (gradale) was a dish or plate - however, with the absence of such an artifact at some time in the past it became associated with a wine goblet (probably communion related) - then with the further absence of a suitably impressive cup it becomes the geneological blood line. In my opinion it is a dish or plate. The big question is ""why must it be kept hidden?"" The answer is that if discovered the images that are engraved into its surface will destroy the basis of the Christian religion. Consider this: Jesus existed, a clever and honest man, but his occupation was not a carpenter but a ""storyteller."" In his possession was the tool of his trade - a plate engraved with the prehistoric zodiac that preceded the present zodiac, a very ancient planisphere that had been passed down through the family for thousands of years. The images on this plate were used to form ""stories"" or even ""parables"" for others to listen to. The angels, the nativity, John the Baptist and even the crucifixion were stories that could be made up and read from the images on this plate. If this were true it would explain why the grail has never been found - it would destroy Christianity."

To worship Him and praise Him. They were here before we were.Satan it says in the Bible was the praise & worship leader of Gods heavenly choir. His angelic name was Lucifer.\n\n One day satan started to wonder why he wasn't considered an equal to our Creator. Then he started to question Gods authority over him and over the other angels and he began to rally them against God. One third of the angels he convinced to war against God. And the way satan became evil was a little sin called Pride. Through out all of this God never interfered.\n\n I think God was waiting for Lusifer to repent. God loves all his creations until He cant reach them anymore. He waited until satan & his followers came agaist Him ready to battle. Ofcourse God won and cast him down to the earth.\nAll of this occurred before man was created. \n\nI belive that the reason GoD gives us all free will,angels included, is because He is a good parent. I am a mother and I know that I have to let my children make mistakes so that they will, with my guidence, become the kind of adult that I can be proud of & welcome into my home forever. But when they choose not to be good, and I know that I cant reach them anymore, I will cast them out of my house. It will break my heart but I must do it to show the others in my house or the other ones that want to be a part of my house, that that sort of bahavior will not be tolerated. \n\nBecause a parent must love all thier creations, we let them have free will. Understand? Read the Bible and you will see many ways that He has loved us."

"1","Who know about something knows as The Chmelitzk Massacre in Europe?","","The Chmielnitzki Massacre was a furious holocaust in which Cossack troops in Russia and Poland had murdered over 100,000 Jews (out of a world population of about 1,500,000) in the most brutal and painful ways imaginable.\n\nChmielnicki Massacre (1648-1649)\nThe Cossacks, meanwhile, wanted to free the Ukraine from Polish domination — and sought to rule the Ukraine. In 1648, the Cossacks, led by Bohdan Chmielicki, began a series of campaigns by instigating the uprising of the Cossacks against the Jews. Chmielicki told people that the Poles had sold them as slaves “into the hands of the accursed Jews.” Angered by this notion, the Cossacks massacred tens of thousands of Jews during 1648-1649, in a war that would later be considered among the worst of that time period. \n\nMany Polish Jews fled the country, but most were brutally murdered. The massacre was devastating — both in numbers and effect. According to Jewish chronicles, the death toll reached approximately 100,000, and nearly 300 Jewish communities were destroyed. Cossack cruelty was so great that many Jews preferred to flee to captivity under Crimean Tartars, to be sold as slaves. The Deluge, as the catastrophe came to be known, brought devastation to both the Jews and the general population during the years of insurrection, invasions and wars. Famine and epidemics swept through parts of the country.\n\nThe following excerpts describe eyewitness accounts of the atrocities that took place in the regions of Mogila, Zaslav, and Nemirov, between 1648 until 1651.\n\nIn the city of Mogila they slaughtered 800 nobles together with their wives and children as well as 700 Jews, also with wives and children. Some were cut into pieces, others were ordered to dig graves into which Jewish women and children were thrown and buried alive. Jews were given rifles and ordered to kill each other...They surround young women and, as they struggled to escape, cut their clothes from their bodies. Then they performed abominations on them until they died screaming....\n\nThey arrived... (disguised) as if they had come with the Poles... in order that he open the gates of the fortress... and they succeeded... and they massacred about 6,000 souls in the town... and they drowned several hundreds in the water and by all kinds of cruel torments. In the synagogue, before the Holy Ark, they slaughtered with butchers' knives... after which they destroyed the synagogue and took out all the Torah books... they tore them up... and they laid them out... for men and animals to trample on... they also made sandals of them... and several other garments"".\n\nSome were skinned alive and their flesh was thrown to the dogs; some had their hands and limbs chapped off and their bodies thrown on the highway to be trampled by wagons and crushed by horses; some had wounds inflicted upon them and were then thrown on the street to die a slow death. They tore open women and then whipped them forcing them to crawl to their deaths.... others were buried alive. The enemy slaughtered infants in their mothers' laps. They were sliced into pieces like fish.... The infants were hung on the breasts of their mothers. Some children were pierced with spears.\n\nThe Ukraine did eventually become independent — but not for long. In 1651, Chmielnicki suffered defeat and was forced to accept a treaty that did not give him as much control over the Ukraine as he had hoped. In 1654, Chmielnicki persuaded the Cossacks to transfer their allegiance to the Russian czars. Anti-Semitism worsened after the Ukraine was annexed by Russia in 1653, as the Nationalist and Socialist Party of the Ukraine took control over the region. The pogroms of 1881 broke out and spread through the provinces of the Ukraine.\n\nBut even the Chmielnicki massacres didn’t halt Jewish migration to the Ukraine. Jews continued to play a prominent role in the economic recovery of the country during the 17th and 18th centuries. The sufferings endured by "

"1","Is dying on a cross the worst way possible to die, or are there worse ways?","I have heard people suggest that what Jesus went through was the worst pain that anyone could go through.  Should this assertion be analyzed?  If it´s true that many people volunteer to be crucified every year, then can it really be the worst torture possible?  Did Hypatia, who was skinned alive, die a worse death?  Did many people who were boiled alive, flayed with red-hot pincers, and burned slowly after being coated with oil, die a much worse death?  If Jesus died early on the cross, then did the other two themselves on the other crosses suffer even more?  Is it common to be whipped before being crucified, and if so, have many people been whipped 39 times in a similar fashion?  Did Paul himself say that he was whipped thusly on three separate occasions?  Was the whole process that Jesus went through a normal procedure in Roman times?  Were many other people whipped, forced to carry a cross, and crucified?","Well not that cruxifiction is a walk in the park but YES, there are more painful deaths, ironically some of them were contrived by the very same Church trying to ensure EVERYONE believed the doctrine of Christianity as they saw it during the Inquisition. \n\nSome of their death/torture methods\n\nFlaying- Skinning a person alive and rubbing salt into the raw flesh\n\nDisembowelment- You can imagine for yourself\n\nHung, Drawn and Quatertered- Like the name says\n\nBeing tossed unto spikes- If the landing was not a well aimed one, your death would not be mercifully short. \n\nAmazing how barbaric humans can be."

"1","Why do most christians think that your ""soul"" goes to heaven?Would that make resurrection unnecessary?","I mean if Jesus promised that man would rise from their tombs, what would be the point of them being in Heaven, would they then have to be expelled from heaven to come back down to their resurrected bodies?  That would be ridiculous cause why would one want to be put back on earth if they were in heaven?  Any intelligent commentary would be much appreciated.","First of all, you do not have and immortal soul, if you did, then why had no one gone to Heaven before Jesus came to the Earth, 4000 years had came & gone since Adam & Eve, millions of people had died, what did Jesus say to a man of the Pharisees, Nic·o·de'mus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.\n\nJohn 3:13\nMoreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.\n\nJesus Christ spoke about the condition of the dead. He did so with regard to Lazarus, a man whom he knew well and who had died. Jesus told his disciples: “Lazarus our friend has gone to rest.” The disciples thought that Jesus meant that Lazarus was resting in sleep, recovering from an illness. They were wrong. Jesus explained: “Lazarus has died.” (John 11:11-14) Notice that Jesus compared death to rest and sleep. Lazarus was neither in heaven nor in a burning hell. He was not meeting angels or ancestors. Lazarus was not being reborn as another human. He was at rest in death, as though in a deep sleep without dreams. Other scriptures also compare death to sleep. For example, when the disciple Stephen was stoned to death, the Bible says that he “fell asleep.” (Acts 7:60) Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote about some in his day who had “fallen asleep” in death.  1 Corinthians 15:6.\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that the dead “are conscious of nothing at all.” They are not alive and have no conscious existence anywhere. The account of Lazarus confirms this. Upon returning to life, did Lazarus thrill people with descriptions of heaven? Or did he terrify them with horrible tales about a burning hell? No. The Bible contains no such words from Lazarus. During the four days that he was dead, he had been “conscious of nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Lazarus had simply been sleeping in death.  John 11:11.\nThe account of Lazarus also teaches us that the resurrection is a reality, not a mere myth. Jesus raised Lazarus in front of a crowd of eyewitnesses. Even the religious leaders, who hated Jesus, did not deny this miracle. \n\nThink about this too: If Lazarus had been in heaven for those four days, would he not have said something about it?—  And if he had been in heaven, would Jesus have made him come back to earth from that wonderful place?   Of course not!\n\nYet, many people say that we have a soul, and they say that the soul lives on after the body dies. They say that Lazarus’ soul was alive somewhere. But the Bible does not say that. It says that God made the first man Adam “a living soul.” Gen. 2:7,  Adam was a soul. The Bible also says that when Adam sinned, he died. He became a “dead soul,” and he returned to the dust from which he had been made. The Bible also says that all Adam’s offspring inherited sin and death too.\n\nThe Scriptural teaching of the resurrection, however, is not compatible with the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. If an immortal soul survived death, no one would need to be resurrected, or brought back to life. Indeed, Martha expressed no thought about an immortal soul that was living on elsewhere after death. She did not believe that Lazarus had already gone to some spirit realm to continue his existence. On the contrary, she showed her faith in God’s purpose to reverse the effects of death. She said: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.” (John 11:23, 24) Likewise, Lazarus himself related no experiences of some afterlife. There was nothing to report.\n\nClearly, according to the Bible, the soul dies and the remedy for death is the resurrection.

"1","Has anybody here lived in Hawaii?  What did you think of it?  Good and bad.?","","Grew up in Hawaii.  Very high cost of living, service/tourist economy with relatively low wages, affordable housing is very limited.  If you have a high-paying profession and secure a job before going there, and you are a maniac for out of doors activity, particularly ocean sports, don't mind a ""small town"" feel in terms of amount of cultural options/mindset/etc., living in a relatively small place (you can drive around Oahu in a few hours without traffic for example) then Hawaii is heaven.  Its a nice place to live if you have money to travel elsewhere when you want to.  If you're a true city person, fuggedaboudit."

As for the Ten Commandments they do not follow them. It says to keep the sabbath it also says not to light a fire in your home on the sabbath.

This words means that there are some people who immortal until Jesus 2nd coming (is it related to 1000 years kingdom?). Is it true?what do you think?If it's true, have anyone met those guys already?i would like to meet them","JESUS has come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, and he is teaching a crowd that includes his apostles. He makes this startling announcement to them: “Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here that will not taste death at all until first they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.”\n\n‘What could Jesus mean?’ the disciples must wonder. About a week later, Jesus takes Peter, James, and John along with him, and they climb a lofty mountain. Possibly it is at night, since the disciples are sleepy. While Jesus is praying, he is transfigured before them. His face begins to shine as the sun, and his garments become brilliant as light.\n\nHow strengthening this vision proves to be, both to Jesus and to the disciples! The vision is, as it were, a preview of Christ’s Kingdom glory. The disciples saw, in effect, “the Son of man coming in his kingdom,” just as Jesus had promised a week earlier. After Jesus’ death, Peter wrote about their having ‘become eyewitnesses of Christ’s magnificence while they were with him in the holy mountain.’"

Then carefully, tilting the pitcher, pour the clear water down one side.  Then, still tilting, pour in the icewater.  You will only have a couple of minutes to observe.  \n\nIf you look at things through the pitcher sideways, parts are normal, parts are yellow and parts are blue.  If you pick it up and look through the top or bottom, everything is green.  It is still only one pitcher of water, yet depending on how you look at it, things seem different, but yet remain the same.  That is about as close as our finite minds will ever come in this lifetime to comprehending an infinite God."

"1","is behaviour based on the circumstances in which you are raised or do inherent tendencies hold a stronger sway","why do people who are raised by loving, moral families sometimes commit acts that are amoral?","Ahhh...nature versus nurture!  Even the experts cannot say with certainty whether nature and your genetic makeup or your nurturing is what makes up the person. There have been studies done with twins who were raised apart, and found that the twins had MANY things that they did just alike, from little things such as which hand they used to open a letter to bigger things such as they body-type and coloring of the people they fell in love with!  There have also been many studies done as to how poverty, violence, drug/alcohol abuse, sexual/physical abuse and parental abandonment affects children, especially in the birth to age 4 range, and how this shows up in their later life as violence in men and self-abuse in women. So having said all this, I personally feel that it is a combination of both, and sometimes it is neither. There are always the stories of the family who did everything right and still wound up with a drug addicted child or a murderer or rapist on their hands. But if you take a 'normal' family and have them raise a child (by normal I mean average, honest, working, functioning people)you will by and large see differences in that child as compared to a child raised by a disfunctional, abusive, out of control, self-serving family.

If a date doesn't work out as planned or hoped they laugh it off and make the most of a broken situation.\n\n3.  Doesn't need constant attention to every single one of her needs.  She can solve many problems on her own.\n\n4.  Isn't bitchy or annoying with everything she says or with every opinion she articulates.\n\n5.  Doesn't have to be the center of attention all of the time--is content to allow the spotlight to shine on others sometimes.\n\nOf course the exact same things apply to a guy also.  Guys can be just as high maintenance as girls can be."
"1","Why do heterosexual tell us as much, when defending homosexuals?","I have been reading many questions and answers on this site today, about being proud of being gay, defending it, rants about the homophobes. The disturbing issue here is that in nearly all the posts I’ve read, and I read at least 30, the heterosexuals who wrote amazing nodes, I mean succinct, intelligent, and well written, all had to write: ""I'm not a homosexual"" or ""I'm a heterosexual"".\n\nWhy is this? Who cares what your preference is? You just finished writing that you didn't care, that you were cool with homosexuals etc. By telling us all that you in fact are not homosexual in a homosexual post, is quite indicative of not really being okay with the whole thing. Your sexual preference was not an issue; it had no relevance to the post.\nSexual preference has no weight in measuring a person's self worth, so why tell us you are or are or are not?","They want to disillusion the bigots who seem to think that it's gay vs. straight instead of smart vs. ignorant."

"1","How would you feel it you knew there wasn't a God?","","It wouldn't matter much to me one way or the other.  However, I think to most the lack of a higher power means we have to accept:\n\n- Responsibility for learning, instead of defaulting everything to God\n- That we are alone\n- That bad things happen without an evil force to guide them\n- That good things happen without a just force to guide them\n- That there is no divine justice\n- That there is no afterlife.  When we die, we're done.\n- That we cannot seek comfort outside of our own society\n- That we cannot change unfortunate events, or inspire fortunate ones simply by praying.\n\nThat's a LOT for people some people to deal with.  So, I think it would be easy for those who have already dealt with some of these things, and devistating for those who haven't."
"1","Is it racist to assume that people of a certain race will be racist towards you?","Ok...It was hard to word the question, but anyway, I have a family friend who is from the islands.

I initially didnt want to call her a racist (more along the lines of *racially tense*), but her comments have become a constant prejudgement. I was just wondering if anyone else has ever dealt with a person like this and if so, what would you say to someone like that. \n\nIs it because she feels lower than whites or what??","She might feel lower than whites or has been brain washed by other haters.\nI usually give up on people like that because it is hard to make a person care once they have hate in their minds."

Usually, if someone ticks me off, I can often see their side, I think I work harder at dropping my anger when it is outwards rather than inwords.  What is your experience with this matter?","i try to avoid anger, it's a counterproductive emotion and i almost never display it.  for me, frustration is much more common.\n\nbut for the sake of your question, i would rather be angry at myself than at you.  if i did something stupid enough to earn that self-inflicted anger, i'd have no one else to blame.  i'd try and figure out why i did what i did, and how it could be made up, to me or to others.  i must answer to myself every time i look in the mirror, and if anger is my response, well then i must have done something stupid to warrant it.  and i know i can find it in me to forgive myself. :)\n\nif i'm angry with YOU, it's likely going to be accompanied by a fair bit of frustration as well.  and since YOU earned my wrath (i'm not really scary at all, don't worry!) i'd feel upset; i think of myself as a very level-headed person.  what could you possibly do to get me to be that way?  and how can i turn the anger into something else?  this is much worse than being angry with myself, and far less predictable.  not a fan.  eventually, i'll ALWAYS forgive... but in the meantime...

When the Romans came to Scotland, they found two distinct populations, the Britons, speaking some dialect related to early Welsh, and the Picts in the far North, speaking a language unknown to us, which may or may not have been Indo-European - perhaps develpoed from the language of the pre-Celtic inhabitants.\n\nAfter the Romans left, thse two peoples were joined by Anglo-Saxons in the South, and Scots in the West, a tribe who crossed from Ireland, bringing with them the Gaelic language.\n\nSo the ""Scots"" were from Ireland; but today's Scottish people are descended from a mixture of all four peoples (plus newcomers).\n\nWorth noting that Gaelic, still spoken in the Western Isles, has never been spoken in more thatn half the country; Scots English is at least as authentically Scottish. The Picts and the Welsh were absorbed by the others."

After reading the column, take the suggest action at the bottom of this email. After you have read it, please forward it to your friends and family. \n\nAmerica, Not Keith Ellison, decides what book a congressman takes his oath on \nBy Dennis Prager - Tuesday, November 28, 2006 \n\nKeith Ellison, D-Minn., the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, has announced that he will not take his oath of office on the Bible, but on the bible of Islam, the Koran. \n\nHe should not be allowed to do so -- not because of any American hostility to the Koran, but because the act undermines American civilization. \n\nFirst, it is an act of hubris that perfectly exemplifies multiculturalist activism -- my culture trumps America's culture. What Ellison and his Muslim and leftist supporters are saying is that it is of no consequence what America holds as its holiest book; all that matters is what any individual holds to be his holiest book. \n\nForgive me, but America should not give a hoot what Keith Ellison's favorite book is. Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don't serve in Congress. In your personal life, we will fight for your right to prefer any other book. We will even fight for your right to publish cartoons mocking our Bible. But, Mr. Ellison, America, not you, decides on what book its public servants take their oath. \n\nDevotees of multiculturalism and political correctness who do not see how damaging to the fabric of American civilization it is to allow Ellison to choose his own book need only imagine a racist elected to Congress. Would they allow him to choose Hitler's ""Mein Kampf,"" the Nazis' bible, for his oath? And if not, why not? On what grounds will those defending Ellison's right to choose his favorite book deny that same right to a racist who is elected to public office? \n\nOf course, Ellison's defenders argue that Ellison is merely being honest; since he believes in the Koran and not in the Bible, he should be allowed, even encouraged, to put his hand on the book he believes in. But for all of American history, Jews elected to public office have taken their oath on the Bible, even though they do not believe in the New Testament, and the many secular elected officials have not believed in the Old Testament either. Yet those secular officials did not demand to take their oaths of office on, say, the collected works of Voltaire or on a volume of New York Times editorials, writings far more significant to some liberal members of Congress than the Bible. Nor has one Mormon official demanded to put his hand on the Book of Mormon. And it is hard to imagine a scientologist being allowed to take his oath of office on a copy of ""Dianetics"" by L. Ron Hubbard. \n\nSo why are we allowing Keith Ellison to do what no other member of Congress has ever done -- choose his own most revered book for his oath? \n\nThe answer is obvious -- Ellison is a Muslim. And whoever decides these matters, not to mention virtually every editorial page in America, is not going to offend a Muslim. In fact, many of these people argue it will be a good thing because Muslims around the world will see what an open society America is and how much Americans honor Muslims and the Koran. \n\nThis argument appeals to all those who believe that one of the greatest goals of America is to be loved by the world, and especially by Muslims because then fewer Muslims will hate us (and therefore fewer will bomb us). \n\nBut these naive people do not appreciate that America will not change the attitude of a single American-hating Muslim by allowing Ellison to substitute the Koran for the Bible. In fact, the opposite is more likely: Ellison's doing so wi","I am not sure how to respond to this but I do get alerts from AFA also... I will check it out ..Thanks for the Info..."

Britain didn't have a welfare system back then, so there were lots of poor people living in slums in major cities like London. The poor often had to go to workhouses, or if they were lucky, they were sometimes employed as household servants. Alcoholism was rampant in the slums. Women were sometimes forced to take up prostitution in order to buy booze and to survive. There was a high infant mortality rate among the poor.\n\nThis is a very loaded question, but I hope I gave some helpful information."

Just as electrical energy produces warmth, sound or light depending on the device through which it passes, similarly, the energy of consciousness functions through three different but closely connected faculties, referred to respectively by the terms mind, intellect, and personality.\n\nThe Mind\nWith the power of the mind, one imagines, thinks and forms ideas. Thoughts are created in the mind. The thought process is the basis of all emotions, desires and sensations. It is through the minds that, in an instant, thoughts reach anywhere, a memory can be relived and the feeling of happiness or sadness is experienced. The metaphysical mind should not be confused with the heart, the physical organ that maintains blood circulation"

What happens if I'm scared of telling someone the truth, because it can hurt their feelings, then is it okay? Or is it never okay, no matter what?","It depends on what the information is.\n\nIf you are simply sharing information about the person just to be negative about him or her, it's not okay.\n\nIf you are reporting something about the person for his/her or society's benefit, it might be okay.\n\nFor example, if you are saying to your coworker that you don't like so-and-so's outfit, it's not okay, because you are simply being negative for no apparent reason.  A friend of mine says a good rule of thumb for these is to never say anything about the person that you wouldn't say if he/she were there.\n\nIf you are reporting something about the person because you are trying to make life better for that person and/or society, it might be okay.  For example, if you know that your neighbor committed a crime, you might report it to the police without your neighbor knowing.  But you are doing it in the interest of a safer society.  Or if you find out that your friend has an eating disorder, you might tell her parents behind her back, but you do so because you hope that they will help her get the help she needs.\n\nGreat question.

It is often a difficult and life-long learning process (to learn additional languages) but with tremendous benefits. Whenever I hear another language being spoken, I try to find the similarities that underlies all modern language. It inspires me to learn more about that particular language and also about the culture of the people that speak it. I suggest everyone should try to learn a few common phrases in any language, so that they may have the oppurtunity to communicate with someone you might not have otherwise ever thpught to do."

"1","What do you think we learned from the late 60's, if anything? Your answer cann't be 'nothin', or 'GO LSD!'","I just saw a movie/documentary called The Drug Years... It was the second of four movies with this title, showing the late 60's and the impact drugs had on them. Let me say, for the majority of the time, I had this feeling of hope circulating through my chest, because I believe the hippies and the musicians had the right idea. I'm not saying lets all go out and get stoned on LSD, but they were using it to uplift their minds, think outside the box, and LOVE LOVE LOVE all, aside from prejudice, hate, and war... up until Manson used LSD to hack into the ugliness inside of him and went on his sordid killing spree, and Janis, Jim and Hendrix all died at 26, and the pigs shot everyone; that's when the hope seemed to die inside of me... I think it's sad that it took drugs to show this side of ppl in such monolithic proportions, and even more dissapointing that the myopic government came out on-top. I think everyone should have a picture of a flower in the barrel of a gun though!!!","I think we learned a lot. I watched the program, too, and lived through the hippie scene, so I had a lot of feelings and thoughts.\n\nI think, in the end, what we learned is that we don't have to be cookie-cutter copies of the ""norm."" My parents (WWII era folks) honestly did not know that.\n\nBut we also learned that you can't really reject the society around you, because, face it, baby, you IS the society.\n\nAnd we learned that, while perhaps LSD and pot weren't as bad as our parents thought they were, the cows don't get milked when everybody is too stoned to milk 'em.\n\nOh, yeah, we learned to question authority. That's a real good lesson, and one we need to hold on to.\n\n""Free love,"" well, that seemed kinda neat at the time, but it loses its patina when you keep waking up in strange places with strangers. And then there's HIV, of course, and that sure ain't groovy.\n\nHippies were young people, as a rule. And young people are idealistic, as another rule. That's how it should be. But getting older teaches you that throwing out ALL of the old ideas isn't necessarily the best course of action.\n\nWe learned that not all drugs are good, not all people trustworthy, not all ideals worth dying for, and not all revolutions bad. (Or good!)\n\nAll in all, it was an amazing time. Since I couldn't have gotten here without coming from there, I don't know what I'd have been like in a different time, but I think I'm glad I was there."

Love is telling them the good news! Not giving up hope on them! Praying for them! Not joining in with what they believe- not telling them its ""ok"" if they believe something that is against God and what the Bible says- So what is a Christian? Someone who FOLLOWS Christ-\n\nMatthew 4:19\n""Come, follow me,"" Jesus said, ""and I will make you fishers of men.""","Jesus Himself asked Peter, ""Do you love me?   ...then feed my sheep!""\n\nLove is not turning our backs to our brothers and sisters who do not know Christ (though it often times involves less conflict and persecution). That is the opposite of love (and it is sad that such apathy toward the calling to share the Gospel often comes under the deceptive banner of ""tolerance"")."

Ceasar was the first emperor to kill Christians and then Nero who killed Peter and Paul and set Christians on fire as torches to make light for his chariot races on Vatican Hill. That's basically the only time. In some countries now you have some killings but not major ones. The Jewish people went through a hell of a lot more. Especially with Hitler. I don't know why people whine so much. Everyone believes in something different deal with it you know. Just because you don't think it's right doesn't make it wrong. To them your religion may seem weird. I have studied all the major religions and find them quit interesting. I can see the point that they are coming across with. I think the people who want to be ignorant should go do some research before they open their mouths. GOOD POINT!!!!!you made.\n\n\n\nand Genesis...i think you are the one who has to do some research. I don't know where you got your ideas from but they are not right. Other religions do not kill you for caring around the bible, a few countries do but thats not persecution. Muslims kill other Muslims for converting Christianity. Muslims don't like Christianity for the fact they think the trinity refers to three different people.. they are monotheistic. They don't kill us for caring the bible. As a matter of fact your not even allowed in Mecca, their holy city without being Muslim. DO SOME RESEARCH GESH!!!!!! And Jewish people do not believe in Jesus, they just think he was a jewish guy. And they weren't killed because they believed in the true god. Hitler just didn't like them.\n\n\nFirst of all just because a couple of thousand Christians are killed in other countries doesn't make it persecution we kill thousands of people of different religions with hate groups that are supposedly Christians and they don't call it persecution they call it justification. Now 6 million Jews being killed I classify as persecution. Grow up people\n\nSanta Claus was based on a real person St. Nicholas he had lots of money and used to go around at night and throw money into the houses of poor people.

"1","Do Mormons really believe Jesus is the brother of Satan?","I heard this today and wondered if any Mormons could confirm.","Yes, Mormons do believe that.  But, like someone already stated, they believe that we were all brothers in sisters in the ""Spirit World"" (where our souls lived before getting a physical body here on earth).\n\nThey believe that there was a council in the Spirit World, where God (""Heavenly Father""), wanted to conceive a plan for humans to be able to return back to Him.\n\nAccording to Mormon belief, Satan's idea was to make everyone faithful to God and to not give free will to humans.\n\nHowever, Jesus' idea was to give humans the ability to choose with their hearts who to follow.  It basically was the concept that being worshiped by choice is much more rewarding than being worshiped by force or not having any other option.\n\nMormons believe there was a ""war in heaven"" between Jesus and Satan.  God chose Jesus' idea, which made Satan rebel.  While Jesus was made ""Savior,"" Satan was thrown out of heaven.  With him went 1/3 of the spirits - those who chose to rebel, as well."

"1","Do you think all ""creation"" could have been made to be better than this?","If you think there couldn't be a better way then, are you saying everything is perfect?","If you are trying to get at ""Why are there disasters?"" or ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"", then here is my response.\n\nGod loves each one of us (even those of us who don't accept His sacrifice, Jesus) and because this love is just so huge, He is fair.  He doesn't force anyone to love Him.  He lets us choose.  So, why did the sweet lady get her purse stolen?  Because that robber has the same choice that we all make: do we follow what God has told us in His instructions to us (the Bible), have we listened to Jesus and allowed Him to pay for our sins, and have we daily allowed the Holy Spirit to rule our lives?  \n\nSo because we all (even dedicated, born-again Christians) make mistakes, and fall away from God and His word, WE are choosing to live for Him or against Him.  God did make everything perfect- He said that it was after every day- even the sixth day when He made man.  \n\nTo put this all in perspective, though, this life is just a moment in time compared to eternity with Christ.  When we have a bummer week in this life, it seems to last for so long, but 10 years later, we only remember a bit of it.  Same is true when we will be praising God or be banished from His presence for eternity.  Then that will be perfect.  For always.  No more tears.  I have already been praying for you."

"1","R those crazy stories in the bible supposed to have happened?","all those fairytale types of stories is what im talking about. some say they are others say they arent.","The answer depends on which stories and the context in which you are asking.  Much of the Bible relates true history and has been documented by archealogical study.  Some Bible stories are exactly that, stories.  This doesn't mean they are not true in the theological sense.  They are stories told to relate a truth about God and his relationship with people.  Its like telling a story to illustrate a point.  The story may not be true, but the point the teller is making is true.  The key is to know what kind of story you are reading.  There are histories.  There is poetry.  There are songs.  There are philosophical dissertations.  Many forms of literature appear in the Bible.  When reading remember what the Bible is for.  God is trying to help us to know who he is and how he wants us to be.  If we read looking for the answer to these questions, ""Who is God?"" and ""Who are God's people?"" we will find that the answers found in the Bible are always true."

"1","What is Ramadan?","","Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim calendar. It is during this month that Muslims observe the Fast of Ramadan. Lasting for the entire month, Muslims fast during the daylight hours and in the evening eat small meals and visit with friends and family. It is a time of worship and contemplation. A time to strengthen family and community ties.\n\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Islam uses a lunar calendar—that is, each month begins with the sighting of the new moon. Because the lunar calendar is about 11 days shorter than the solar calendar used elsewhere, Islamic holidays ""move"" each year. In 2006 Ramadan will begin on Sept. 24.\n\nFor more than a billion Muslims around the world—including some 8 million in North America—Ramadan is a ""month of blessing"" marked by prayer, fasting, and charity. This year Ramadan precedes Christmas and Hanukkah. But while in many places these holidays have become widely commercialized, Ramadan retains its focus on self-sacrifice and devotion to Allah (God).\n\nWhy this Month?\n\n\nMuslims believe that during the month of Ramadan, Allah revealed the first verses of the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam. Around 610 A.D., a caravan trader named Muhammad took to wandering the desert near Mecca (in today's Saudi Arabia) while thinking about his faith. One night a voice called to him from the night sky. It was the angel Gabriel, who told Muhammad he had been chosen to receive the word of Allah. In the days that followed, Muhammad found himself speaking the verses that would be transcribed as the Qur'an. \n\nAt many mosques during Ramadan, about one thirtieth of the Qur'an is recited each night in prayers known as tarawih. In this way, by the end of the month the complete scripture will have been recited. \n\nFasting\n\n\nMuslims practice sawm, or fasting, for the entire month of Ramadan. This means that they may eat or drink nothing, including water, while the sun shines. Fasting is one of the Five Pillars (duties) of Islam. As with other Islamic duties, all able Muslims take part in sawm from about age twelve. \n\nDuring Ramadan in the Muslim world, most restaurants are closed during the daylight hours. Families get up early for suhoor, a meal eaten before the sun rises. After the sun sets, the fast is broken with a meal known as iftar. Iftar usually begins with dates and sweet drinks that provide a quick energy boost. \n\nFasting serves many purposes. While they are hungry and thirsty, Muslims are reminded of the suffering of the poor. Fasting is also an opportunity to practice self-control and to cleanse the body and mind. And in this most sacred month, fasting helps Muslims feel the peace that comes from spiritual devotion as well as kinship with fellow believers. \n\nEid al-Fitr\n\n\nRamadan ends with the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which in 2006 occurs on Oct. 24. Literally the ""Festival of Breaking the Fast,"" Eid al-Fitr is one of the two most important Islamic celebrations (the other occurs after the Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca). At Eid al-Fitr people dress in their finest clothes, adorn their homes with lights and decorations, give treats to children, and enjoy visits with friends and family. \n\nA sense of generosity and gratitude colors these festivities. Although charity and good deeds are always important in Islam, they have special significance at the end of Ramadan. As the month draws to a close, Muslims are obligated to share their blessings by feeding the poor and making contributions to mosques."

A perennial best seller, the book has been in continuous publication since it first appeared and has been translated into 18 languages. It is widely regarded as a modern spiritual classic.\n\nIn 1920, Yogananda was invited to serve as India's delegate to an international congress of religious leaders convening in Boston. His address to the congress, on ""The Science of Religion,"" was enthusiastically received. That same year he founded Self-Realization Fellowship to disseminate worldwide his teachings on India's ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its time-honored tradition of meditation.\n\nFor the next several years, he lectured and taught on the East coast and in 1924 embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. The following year, he established in Los Angeles an international headquarters for Self-Realization Fellowship, which became the spiritual and administrative heart of his growing work.\n\nThere is a course you can take to learn his meditation techniques.  It's a very accepting group.  I once belonged, when I was interested in learning more about that form of yoga and meditation."

I would start with ""Fear and Trembling,"" as it's accessible (although still difficult).\n\nTo a great extent, the freedom that God has given us does extend to our purpose.  The problem with ""The Purpose Driven Life"" and its ilk (and by the way, do you know *anyone* who has truly changed her/his life six months after reading this book?  I don't) is that it doesn't offer deep changes and insights.  (It's also a bit Pelagian for my taste, but that's another story).\n\nI believe that God created us so that God could have fellowship with us, but the freedom that we're given means that we have a life in which to dance with meaning-making."

""Well this isn't working, time to change tactics""\n\nDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is the definition of insanity!! \n\nComplaining however is whole different thing in itself..Is it really that you're complaining about it... or needing feedback from an outsider's view to see if your decisions are with sound reason..and as long as you're looking for more info on what went wrong..and learning from them.. \n\nGiving up that right to complain happens when you aren't at all conscience that you have any responsibility in what has happened .... blaming circumstances, blaming others, blaming anything else but what you've personally contributed that made this outcome a reality is what voids the complaint department to me.  And it's okay to complain about yourself, as long as you're learning what you did doesn't work, and try a new path next time, and if the same result happen again.. and you complain.. to me that means you're looking for someone else's view to help see what you might have missed in the situation.\n\nGood Example?..Well I am a work-a-holic, and help-a-holic, When I have time I give it.. and where I see troubles I try to help with it. My hubby's granny had many troubles with credit cards, bills, health and a live in son that most of the time wasn't employed..So I took every path imaginable to bring back value and calmness to her life, but you can't help those who won't help themselves.. so as much as I tried to help in different venues, it was fruitless...you can't invite a person to live with you to help them, for them to want to bring the problem with them to you. And I don't hear them complain anymore since my hubby and I have made several offers to help, and they don't accept those terms, it's the only terms we are able to give.

Heidi","Its a lot like anything else. You either have faith in it or you don't.  They did prove its authenticity.  They know it was around at 180Ce.  And they do have a point (those that have answered) that they cannot prove that what the contents say is fact. (meaning this is actually what was said and all that) However if you want to take that route we can say the same for the other Gospels. Those in the bible and those not.  The Gospels in the bible are just as old.  We were not there.  We take what the scriptures say on faith. (for those who believe) So this book is no different.)  I personally feel that this Gospel has a lot to offer in our understanding of Jesus and his Disciples.  Just as the Nag Hammadi Library and the Dead Sea Scrolls.  They give us more insight. More understanding.  And, I feel, They give us something to weigh against the Gospels and other books in the New Testiment."

But let's just try to imagine that you are, say, a Palestinian whose house has just been torn down to make way for an Israeli settlement while your family was still inside and your little brother just died of appendicitis because the Israeli army wouldn't let the ambulance pass the checkpoint to get to the hospital. Or imagine that you live in Haditha, Iraq, and no one can go outside because the US army forces that came to save you from Saddam are having daily firefights outside your door with rebel leaders, and then one day one of their tanks gets hit and they get so mad that they storm your house and shoot everyone inside... mom, dad, babies, kids, grandparents... and then they go on to your neighbor's house and do the same. Or imagine that you live in Afghanistan where the Taliban have been pushed out of power, but that has left no real government in control and so your mom and your sisters can't leave the house because if any men find them on the streets they are likely to be raped and killed. These are real scenes from the daily life of thousands of people.\n\nNow...imagine that some other nation or group managed to destroy our central government and take over our country. Imagine that you lived every day in fear of those people, knowing that they suspect you of being up to no good just because you live here, watching them patrol your neighborhood streets with guns and tanks, seeing them try to question people who get scared and run and then are shot down in cold blood. Imagine that the idea of safety and comfort and home and family has been destroyed and replaced by fear and paranoia, by hunger and poverty and disease. Imagine after days and then weeks and then months and then years of this how desperate you would begin to feel. And yet, if you try to speak out against what is happening, then the world media labels you as an ""insurgent,"" and ""extremist,"" and a ""terrorist."" Imagine how your sense of patriotism and the need to protect to your family would drive you to take action... some action... any action.\n\nSo to answer your one-sided, uneducated question- it isn't so much a matter of old guys brainwashing young guys into comitting suicide, as much as entire societies that are in terrible situations and young kids who still have enough hope left that they can make a difference that they go out and do something desperate."

You really have put some thought into them.\nI also have a feeling that you know the answers to your own questions and ask them just to get people to think.\n\nI believe whole heartedly that some mental illnesses are spiritual conditions.  Have you ever wondered why more and more people are diagnosed with depression, ADD, bi polar, and other illnesses every year?\nI think it is a direct relation to the way God's influence is consistently less every year on society.  People are rejecting His laws and ways more aggressively and openly every year.\nIt's not that these people don't have the symptoms, but it is being misunderstood.\n\nNow, I do believe that some of these people really need medical help.  But many of them are in a bad spiritual state.  They lacked discipline as a child, they lacked good family upbringings, values, teachings, etc.  It all starts in the home.  And it will continue to get worse because the home is becoming more lost and wicked every year.\n\nThen you also have your bonafide posessions.  Remember that in the bible, Jesus rebuked many demons out of people who were lunatick.\nToday, those people are getting doped up instead of the demons cast out of them.  Their bodies are calm because of the drugs, but they are a spiritual mess inside.\n\nIf you look with the Spirit, you will know that some people that you meet are posessed.  I have met a few myself and have had confrontations with them spiritually.  It's not fun, let me tell you.\n\nI think the state of this world is in a mental illness.  Their logic and reason is anything but logical or reasonable.  The way society views and handles issues today is sickening.  \n\nI could go on and on about this, but I think you get the point I'm trying to make.\n\nI can guarantee you that you will never find a true Christian in a mental ward because they are not able to be posessed.  Except for real medical problems like Alzheimers and such, a true Christian is protected from spiritual illness.\n\nAs far as the chemical condition of the brain for people who are mentally ill, you have a cause and effect issue or ""chicken and an egg problem"".\nDid the chemicals cause the condition or did the condition cause the chemicals?  No one knows or will be ever able to answer."

"1","Ancient egyptian slave names?","WHAT ARE SOME ANCIENT EGYPTIAN NAMES FOR SLAVES TO HIGH PHARAOHS","Many ancient Egyptian names contained the name of a god. At times, the god may be assumed, so we have names that contain the phrase ""god is gracious"", or ""whom god loves"", but here the term god undoubtedly refers not to an abstract deity but rather to a specific, assumed deity which might be a local god, or the god to whom the parents prayed. Much of the time, the god was named.\n\nCommon words or phrases were often used in names. These included ankh (life), mery (beloved), hotep (peace), nefer (beautiful) and khenemet (one who is joined with) \n\nMany names could be used by both males and females, and in these instances, an identifier, such as a hieroglyphic man or woman, was appended to the name in order to make it masculine or feminine. However, ""et"" on the end of a name, or sometimes in the middle of it, appears to have been a feminine identifier, and ""pa-sheri"" (masculine) or ""ta-sherit"" (feminine) was somewhat similar to the equivalent of ""Junior"" today. We also find Si, meaning son, or Sit, meaning daughter."

"1","A Serious Question here. I am openning a kind of Debate.?","Why is it that on IM services, people from third world countries are ignored? All that they are trying to do is to make friends all over, but they are given poor response, sometimes even by looking at their country name. They are not even given a chance to prove if they are good or bad. In my personal opinion, they end up acting in a negative way, impersonating as someone they are not. This thing is resulting in increasing number of Liers on internet. Any ideas/opinions/sugessions as to why such classified treatment is given to third world people?","Well, I have some ideas as to why you perceive this to be the case, whether or not it is.  A great many people on the Internet (I do not have IM, so I'm speaking more generally) are using English as a second language.  If they take their time, really carefully compose their sentences, we wouldn't even know that they had not been using English for many years.  Their English teachers would be very proud of them.  But IM goes too fast for that; you have to be quick to keep up with the dialog.  So a non-native speaker who has not been using English very long will start to get incomprehensible.\n\nOf course, there is also some hostility and resentment on the part of some people toward what they feel is an ""invasion"" from ""foreigners.""  In any country with a good bit of socialism (housing, medical care, whatever), it is easy to feel that the newcomers are getting preferential treatment over the citizens.  I know this has happened a great deal in England, for example, and to a lesser but still noticeable degree in the US.  This builds up an attitude that anyone from a third world country who tries to learn English is trying to ""come over here and use up our scarce resources.""  It may or may not be true of a given person, and there's no reason to assume it is true, but the inflated bureaucracy that is in place to ""care for"" immigrants is horribly expensive, and breeds resentment."

It's a representation of an idea that is important for some people, but that has been used and ABused by different powers to manipulate and control humanity, by the fear of the unknown and the panic of ""eternal damnation"", a very powerful invention they've come up with.\n\nSo, god represents a lot to different people, but it's a relevant social concept for all of us, too.

"1","Poll – How do you interpret this Scripture passage about women?","NOTE: Below is the particular passage… but more reading maybe required.\n\n1 Corinthians 14:33-35\n[33] For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints, [34]  women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.  [35]  If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.  (NIV)\n\nPossible Interpretations:\n\nA) Women should not speak at all… in gathered assemblies. \n--- Which, to me, doesn’t make sense --- in light of 1 Corinthians 11:5\n\nB) Women are supposed to show respect and not disrupt the assembly by noisy discussions, talking in the background, and etc.\n\nPlease try your best to prove your point --- your thoughts in this matter are important.","This passage has gotten a lot of attention over the years - It seems everyone knows this passage - whether they know anything else about the Bible or not!\nMany (most?) overlook the fact that this command does not stand alone. Paul had already given this command for silence twice in the same passage - once applied to those who speak in tongues, and once to the prophets, and finally to the women. In all three cases, a close examination of the original language will show that the exact same words are used each time, however, most translations render it differently for the command to women.\nIn these three verses, ""be silent"" had to do with taking turns. It is not a unilateral command to for all time - it is a call for order and direction; for the proper use of the giftings God has bestowed on the various members of the church.\n\nPaul was making sure that women were not left out of the church! He knew that they were at a disadvantage in the culture, with little (closer to NO) opportunity for education. Paul sought to eradicate that, so that by their husband's instruction, they could function as peers. This might seem like a small thing today, but at that time it was HUGE. Even while he was correcting the chaos of the church, he was providing a way for the women to better themselves. His words were not harsh authoritarianism, relegating women to to some narrow role. On the contrary, they were opening new doors of opportunity for those who society had excluded and ingnored.\nClose examination of other Scriptures will reveal that Paul considered, Chloe, Priscilla, Stephana, and Phoebe, to be Annointed by God to leadership positions withing the church.\nPriscilla instructed Apollos, and neither Luke, nor Paul criticized this fact.\nThere is considerable evidence to suggest that Priscilla could have been the writer of the book of Hebrews.\nPaul even mentions pointedly that Phoebe was a deacon of the church in Chencrea."

We in the family are all very proud of Stash, he made a name for himself in the greater Milwaukee area.

He started off with the usual Polkas, but grew more in love with the rap scene \nthere in Milwaukee. You might know Milwaukee is considered one of the hotbeds of rap. He and the boys from the Butcher Block had many a jam session in the chopping room of the shop. Stash, God bless him, would keep that bloody apron on and let the music flow. Many a good time was had with the Old Milwaukee beer and Kielbasa. \n\nIt was there in the back room of the butcher shop that Stash and the boys came up with ""Play That Funky Polka\nWhite Boy"" a song that flew to the top of the charts.

After about 3 months of knowing him I converted to Islam and he was happy for me, he was a good Muslim at the time. But after 1 year of being married, he has started to do haram things. He is constantly flirting with girls online, not praying, he has made jokes sometimes that he is Christian (he stopped because when he was joking like that, he got very sick and had to go to the hospital and he knew it was punishment from Allah) constantly starting fights with me when I point out what he is doing is against Allah\nAny advice on how to get back my pious husband who I fell in love with? Any discriminatory questions will be ignored.\nThank you..","Assalamu' Alaikum Sister!\n\nPray to Allah (SWT) to guide Him and turn him towards Him. You should also talk to him on your own and tell him that his actions are hurting his deen and you. Listen to Islamic lectures with him, either in a Masjid or at home on tapes. Encourage him to pray by telling him of its rewards and punishments. Tell him about the sin of flirting with the opposite gender (fornication of eyes, hands, etc.). \nThere is also this website you can go to and order a book called ""a gift to bride"". It's a really good book that can guide any married woman. And it only costs about $9. The website you can get it from is www.madania.org and then go to library.\n\nThere is also another website with a huge section on marriage.\nhttp://lightuponthetruth3.tripod.com\n\n\nPS: also you should consult a pious person aobut your husband declaring himself as a christian.

Some places it got messed up and modified, sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.  When we look at figures like Noah and Abraham, they knew the stories and held on to the faith that had been passed to them, where as others didn't.  They added there own stories and eventually it all got written down.\n\nI am sure you know stories of your own family that go back generations but have never been written down.  You can see the variation in the story that each branch of your family tells.\n\nWhere Revelation comes in (and this is where it is often gotten wrong) is that it confirms the story and brings it to a higher plain of understanding.  It is not like the Hebrews didn't know the Genesis account and the book fell out of the sky one day and hit Moses on the head.  Rather God work with Moses to confirm the story and the Lord of History revealed what was clouded and lost."

So can we say that all the name of GODS mentioned in the different religious books (ALLAH, LORD, JEHOVA etc.) designate the same power?? If it is true so why there is so much hate between religions??","A very good question.\nThere are several questions within your one. \nI believe: ( through research and not belonging to any one religion)\n\nReligions define God by a name which is inherent in the human mind to tag something to understand it( tree, dog, human).  With the understanding of infinite thought and probabilities the One religions refer to is the same God.  The Source.  The source of light, dark and all existence.  This is one entity or energy.  \n\nThe paths we as humans choose to find this source is our differing religions each with their merits and flaws.  We seek the same source.  Eventually. \n\nThe Source is no 'man' or 'woman' sitting on a throne being wise, judge mental and all knowing it (It) is simply everything.  That was, will be, is or may be.  It is the fabric which which binds everything.  Before man began to categories or define it.\n\nThe second question within yours hints at the 'prophets' question of the being the only way to the Source. Jesus, Mohamed, Quetzalcoatl, Buddha etc. (note we are speaking only of the prophets of Light) each proclaim that their way is their path God. The ultimate source.\n\nHumans are different in their perceptions of everything so it is reasonable that God would have conceived of different paths to reach the One, ie enlightenment."

"1","True or false are women much cleaner than men?","","Anytime a man and a woman are together, the potential for magic or mayhem exists. Our world has yet to accept the very special gift we’ve been given in being so different. We have not learned to utilize the awesome power available to us in the man-woman dynamic. There are many games to play in this world, but nothing can bring more joy than the man-woman game. There is no finer playing field than relating with the opposite sex to experience all aspects of love and life.\n\nIn order to effectively relate to one another, we must understand and appreciate, the underlying makeup of men and women. Women bring the appetite and desire to the planet. Men bring their capability to produce. In order to move efficiently around the game board of man-woman, we need to recognize women are better than men in the area of desire, and men are more effective than women in producing to satiate those desires.\n\nWe were not created different by accident. The plan has always been perfect, but we have resisted the perfection of our differences. This resistance has been the source of the majority of man-woman breakdowns.\n\nWomen are best at what they want. Men are best at making it happen. Women are the ones who wanted indoor plumbing. Women are the ones who wanted beds up off the floor. They wanted a roof over their head. They wanted more blankets and food for their children. Women are the ones who wanted transportation and markets to do their shopping. They wanted materials to make different clothes; ones for winter and ones for summer. Women have always wanted their basic needs of food, shelter and clothing met. Women wanted, and men provided. Life was simple. It’s not to say that women didn’t make things happen along the way. The truth is, women made everything happen simply by expressing their desires. They wanted more pleasurable experiences.\n\nTimes have changed, and the women of today need to allow men to be men, and empower them to do more of what they do best. Men want women to know they are completely capable of producing whatever women want and need, as long as they are given the opportunity.\n\nOver the past several decades, women have taken on more of the male role of producing. If this continues, we will end up with too much male energy on the planet. The planet doesn’t need more male energy - it needs more feminine energy.\n\nWomen are coming into their power in new and wonderful ways. It’s time for them to pull back from producing so much, and move more into directing. This will allow men to support women in moving things in the direction of the feminine. This will bring balance back to a world where the feminine energy is wanted and needed.\n\nRomance goes out the window when women take on a man’s role. In the times when chivalry was alive and well, women were definitely more feminine. They were happy to be female. They played their part with grace and ease. Men were heroic and romantic. They were happy to court women and women were delighted to be courted. Can you imagine if women were galloping off to slay dragons for their men? When women do the man’s job, it leaves little room for men to be their heroes. There is no game to play, or dragon to slay. It results in no romance.\n\nMark lived in Texas with Allison. Allison had a vacation magazine that had a beautiful picture of an island with gorgeous turquoise waters. She lit up every time she looked at it. One day Mark said to her, “Would you like to go there?” She said, “Yes, that would be like a dream.” That was all she said. The next day Mark bought tickets for them to go. She was simply enjoying the picture and thinking about how much fun it would be to go there. She was not trying to manipulate him in any way. This is different than a woman who asks, “Would you take me there?” or, “Why can’t we go?” There’s no opportunity for men to be the hero if women get their own ‘production’ muscle involved.\n\nWhen a woman expresses her desires, sh"
"1","Please Help?","Okay I'am writing an essay for my health carwe college course, and I just need to know what does Le medidecine liberale mean? its french I think it means the lberal medicine, but I cld be wrong, and what does it symbolizes? is it a special saying?","In contrast to Britain, following the Second World War, France was not a pathbreaker in the domain of social policy. Although the Laroque Report was instrumental in laying the foundations for a social security system based on the notion of national solidarity, unlike the Beveridge Report, it did not reassess the role of the State in assuming responsibility for the general welfare (2). Nor was its influence as broad as that of the Beveridge Report. Whereas the British State increased its control over the health system in one swoop through the nationalization of hospitals and the creation of the NHS in 1948, the French State increased its control more gradually while involving business groups - the palronal - and trade unions in the management of the social security system. As a result of exercising such prudence before tampering with (lie financing of medical care, the French health system is char acterizcd by the co-existence of NHI and private medical practice under fee-for-service reimbursement - what the French call la medecine liberale.La medecine liberale  \n       As far as the provision of medical services is concerned, in French - particularly the medical ambulatory care sector, the French profession - are deeply attached to a set of principles associated with la medecine liberale: selection of the physician by the patient and vice versa, clinical freedom for the doctor, professional confidentiality and, above all, fee-for-service payment. In the hospital sector, the French are committed not merely to the co-existence of public and private non-profit hospitals but also to proprietary hospitals (cliniques) which account for almost 20 per cent of the total number of beds. \n       La medecine liberale can be traced to an often idealized past when the health sector was a cottage industry. Office and home visits were the predominant modes of medical practice and physicians were neither concerned about primary prevention such as occupational health programmes, nor about the diffusion of medical technology, nor about regional teaching hospitals. Since the passage of the first health insurance law in 1928, French professional medical associations have sedulously cultivated an image of the personal, symbiotic doctor-patient relationship. The principles of la medecine liberale were first elaborated in a document called la Charle Medicale, in 1927. In 1955, they were codified by executive decree in the 'Code de Deontologie Medicale.'  \n       Despite the strength and centralization of French public administration, there are few countries where private fee-for-service practice has been more established than in France. Since the Second World War, however, as in other industrially advanced nations, French physicians have practised in a socio-economic context whose growth and changing patterns have transformed the health sector from a cottage industry to a major industrial complex. In the face of such change, the French state has wavered between protecting the prerogalives of la medecine liberale and adapting the health sector to the demands of a modern economy. On the one hand, policymakers have acceded to pressures from the medical profession and the hospital industry; on the other, they have' protected the right of access to medical care by extending health insurance coverage and introducing controls over physicians and hospitals."
"1","what is the NIRVANA level?","how come some pple when become a ""nirvana"" commit suicide?","When a person reaches their nirvana, they have acheived a high level of inner peace, a personal heaven.  When one has reached that state, he is often aware of the eternity of Life (or, at least, the probability or possibility of it).  \n\nWhy does one commit suicide when he reaches his nirvana?  There may be two reasons:  (1)  The person has reached a high level of consciousness and believes he can do no harm (to himself) by leaving this body - and, perhaps, feels he must ""go beyond"" to learn more; (2)  The person has reached a false state of nirvana and, during a brief ""high"" (peaceful state), he decides to ""go beyond"" thinking it is even more peaceful (and longer lasting).\n\nIn the case of #1 above, the question arises ""When does one 'know' he has reached the True state of Nirvana - that is, the highest level of heaven or personal peace.

Actually, I don't hear anything about Hinduism, either, but I  hear NEVER about the Jewish religion or ever see them anywhere.","Several of us will pop up when we see the word Jewish, Judaism, Torah, etc. in the question.  I for example just found your question by putting the word ""Jewish"" in the search for open questions.  I used to scroll through all the questions but that has become too tedious lately and I don't answer on Christian or general Bible matters because I have no need to impose my beliefs on anyone else. \n\nPersonally I think it's time there were subcategories under R&S, so that we can all have a forum to discuss things without constantly being interrupted by people who are not respectful.  To me that's like someone going into a section on mathematics and saying ""i hate math"".  If you don't like the topic, just stay away.  For example when someone asks a question about Jesus, I don't think it's necessary for someone atheist to comment, ""he's a figment of your imagination"" and by the same token I as a Jew, would NOT comment ""he's not the messiah"" even if that's what I believe.  I don't feel it's my place and it is not relevant to the question being asked. Everyone has a right to their beliefs and I don't need to chime in with my opinion every two seconds.  In fact the ones who do this are probably insecure with their belief systems and feel a need to be loud about it.   \n\nAnd for questions asked about Judaism I only answer the ones asked respectfully.  You can tell when someone really wants to know or they just want to spout their own prejudices and are not open to answers. If you scroll through my answers you can see I have answered many questions on Judaism that were asked in a thoughtful and respectful manner.\n\nWell, I hope that answers your question somewhat... :)"

Also mexicans are too religious but they are religious because 'yes'... Do you believe in GOD? 'yes' Why? 'I don't know but I believe'... hmmm I'm not like that... Also mexicans say that it is better to do something even if it is not well done but it is done... and I think that if you are to do something (anything) you have to do it in the best possible way.  Also mexicans have a saying 'There's more time than life'... and they don't care if they arrive on time or not... as they see the future events as a 'question mark'... because of what I already said, they do not see unpunctuality as an offense and I do.\n\nI hope that answers what you're looking for."

Which language should be learned first, Japanese or Korean?","there is no similarity between korean and japanese, other than the fact that the grammar is very similar.  vocabulary-wise, many words in both languages are based off of chinese characters.  however, japanese uses chinese characters (kanji) and pronounce them by pure japanese words, and koreans simply have pure korean and sino-korean vocabulary mixed together... in essence, almost two words for everything.\ni've studied both korean and japanese, and personally, i found korean to be much more enjoyable.  then again, i'm sure this is only personal preference.\ni studied korean intensively in korea, and it takes a while to attain even a basic level of fluency, due to the fact that the grammar is almost completely backwards from english.  however, in korea, most korean people are very helpful and willing to work with you.  when i went to japan, i noticed that most japanese people either ignore you completely if you talk to them, or rattle off as fast as they can even though they know you won't understand it.\nif you're choosing whether to study in either country, i'd certainly recommend korean."

"1","How can a person be speaking in tongues without using the language center of their brains?","There's been some articles on studies done on persons Born Again and speaking in tongues. The studies show that the individuals aren't experiencing mental breakdowns or personality disorders that may result in hearing voices.\n\nTwo items of interest is that none of the test subjects spoke any known language, which was explained that they were speaking the language of the angels. But, when the Apostles received the Holy Spirit and spoke tongues, it was for a purpose, to spread God's Word to many nations, all with different languages.\n\nThe other item of interest was that the test subjects were not using the language centers of the human brain. You would assume, that regardless of what language they would be speaking, they would be using the language center of the brain, unless they were speaking gibberish.  \n\nI imagine someone has an explanation, but it seems to me that in everything, God uses what is available. Wouldn't he also use that portion of the brain meant for languages?","It seems that they are speaking gibberish, but that they don't know it.  They essentially trick themselves into having this religious experience.  This is not saying that someone CANNOT speak in tongues through the Holy Spirit, but only that if they did, only that the examples we see today do not appear to be actual supernatural experiences.  Every linguist who has studied various individuals speaking in tongues has stated that what is being spoken is not an actual language (not just a known language, but that it isn't language).  There are those also that believe they have the gift of interpreting these tongues.  But, when a recording of someone speaking in a tongue has been brought to several interpreters, the interpretations are not the same.  \n\nPeople can trick themselves into believing they are speaking in tongues, or that they understand these tongues, but when put to the test, these ""miracles"" do not seem to be miraculous at all.  These people are not bad people, just fooled."

"1","how do you do an effective lectio divina?","","THE ART of  lectio divina begins with cultivating the ability to listen deeply, to hear “with the ear of our hearts” as St. Benedict encourages us in the Prologue to the Rule. When we read the Scriptures we should try to imitate the prophet Elijah. We should allow ourselves to become women and men who are able to listen for the still, small voice of God (I Kings 19:12); the “faint murmuring sound” which is God's word for us, God's voice touching our hearts. This gentle listening is an “atunement” to the presence of God in that special part of God's creation which is the Scriptures.\n\nTHE CRY of the prophets to ancient Israel was the joy-filled command to “Listen!” “Sh'ma Israel: Hear, O Israel!” In lectio divina we, too, heed that command and turn to the Scriptures, knowing that we must “hear” - listen - to the voice of God, which often speaks very softly. In order to hear someone speaking softly we must learn to be silent. We must learn to love silence. If we are constantly speaking or if we are surrounded with noise, we cannot hear gentle sounds. The practice of lectio divina, therefore, requires that we first quiet down in order to hear God's word to us. This is the first step of lectio divina, appropriately called lectio - reading.\n\nTHE READING or listening which is the first step in lectio divina is very different from the speed reading which modern Christians apply to newspapers, books and even to the Bible. Lectio is reverential listening; listening both in a spirit of silence and of awe. We are listening for the still, small voice of God that will speak to us personally - not loudly, but intimately.

And many nations will certainly go and say: “Come, you people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” For out of Zion law will go forth, and the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem."" - Micah 4:1, 2; Isaiah 2:2, 3."

"1","Why blame Judas? Why blame the Jews?","In the bible, Jesus gave his life for our sins. He knew in advance that he would be crucified, and according to the text it was Gods will that this be done.\n\nIf this is the case, why do we consider Judas a traitor - was he not carrying out God's will?\n\nWhy do so many blame the Jews for the crucifiction when it was God's intention that his son be sacrificed?","For the first part it is simple ...\nThink about this: we are all God's creation and one way or another we carry on God's will. One of the assets given to us is free-will, the will to do as we choose. God's purpose now is to guide us on the right path, but it is us who must walk it. Judas did not know God's will at the time, it was much later that people were aware of what Jesus' death actually ment.\nThe fact that God intended it doesn't excuse Judas' act. It was Judas' choice to betray his teacher and this alone makes his act evil, just like any treason. God doesn't mind-control anyone. He chose to betray Jesus to the romans, thus he is a traitor and his treachery is ten-fold since we are talking about the Son of God (something Judas really believed or he wouldn't be an Apostle).\nAlso the fact that he's a traitor doesn't mean christians should hold a grudge against Judas. After all, he was forgiven for his actions did lead on the right path.\n\nAs for the accusations against the Jews, whatever they had done then, it's all done and it subscribes to the same things I've said above."

How do I tell my parents (They are Christian)?","In order to convert, you have to go through a process.  It involves many things, including meetings with a Rabbi.  You should go to your local synagogue or temple and see what their requirements are to convert.  It is a significant process and not fast or easy.  Several friends have done it and they are very happy with being jewish.  Start attending the local jewish house of worship and ask about conversion classes."

Do they contradict or complement each other?","When the Bible says that God created the rainbow you need to remember that up until the flood, no one ever saw a rainbow because it never rained on the earth until afterward. (The earth was watered by underground springs) God knew that rain was going to cause a refraction of the sunlight, so He ""established"" it as a reminder that He would never again destroy the earth by flood. It may be that at that time, God created the refraction process at the time of the flood. We have never seen or met God. It may just be that when God creates something, the scientific physics are created as well."

"1","Is there really God?If is how many?If one God,how come there is a lot of different religion in the world?","I've been wondering this question since I little.I ask my parents but they couldn't answer that question too,they only answered,believe in what you believe now.And my catholic teacher told me that,there is really God,if not how the world and human be created?What is your opinion about the question above?","Do you really think anyone on Yahoo Answers has the answer to what many philosphers have been trying to figure out for thousands of years? Ehh... I'll try.\n\nI have spent countless nights trying to get some sort of answer myself. It's really hard for me accept that there is a God though. Either that, or it's hard for me to accept the God that my parents tried to drill into to my head since I was a baby. (They are fundamentalist Christians by the way. the outrageous ideas make me sad that there are more people out there like them.)\n\nI think there might a God because it seems very unlikely that such a complex life could have happened by accident, or by an explosion of matter. The way that DNA is constructed, cells, and just the way that the human body functions seems all too perfect for it to happen by some random chance. \n\nHowever, I as I said before, I don't know if I could ever believe in the Catholic or Christian God. Supposedly, God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. That means he is all-good, all-knowing, and all-powerful. I'm sure that you are well aware of the sorrow, suffering and pain that a billion people feel every day due to war,starvation, genocide, poverty, and most importantly evil. If God was all-good, he would not allow this to happen. If God is all-good, but he can't stop it, that means he is not all-powerful. If said God is not all-powerul, then he cannot be God. \n\nGod cannot be omnicent or all-knowing, because humans have free will, and those two are contridictory. One might argue that everything needs a creator. Even the Universe. Something cannot create itself. So God created the universe, but who or what created God? \n\nPerhaps there is a God, but it is likely that all of those rules, and dogmatic views that Christians teach is not accurate. The texts of the Bible have been PROVEN to be altered by numerous kings, who put into it what they wanted. Similar to how George W. Bush is running the country based on his morals. I don't know, you decide.\n\n The answer will probably never be solved, and people will always be kept wondering. I believe in God, but I don't believe in organized religion.\n\nRead this, you would find it interesting. It's a converstaion between an ordinary man and God.

Do you think gay men sit around thinking, ""Gee, I'll go pack some fudge just to piss off my preacher?"" The medical and psychiatric communities have already figured out that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. It is not a condition, disease, or ailment and therefore cannot be cured, treated, vilified. These so called ex-gay religious groups fooling themselves. A person can choose who or what gender they engage in sex with, but they cannot choose who they are attracted to.

"1","Nicolatians believe.....?","In the bible.","The doctrine of the Nicolaitans was mentioned in the Apocalypse of John to the churches of Pergamos and Ephesus of the seven churches of Asia in Revelation 2. It was a symbolic name of a party that represents the hierarchy of a ruling class over the rest of the people, developing a ""pecking order"" of fleshly leadership. Jesus hated this and warns the people to repent or else ""I will come upon you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth."" The same warning illustration is applied to those that abused grace, which led to licentiousness from the example of Balaam, seducing Christians to fornication and tampering with idolatry. The individual overcomer is allowed to eat of the hidden manna and given a white stone with a new name written in it.\nThe Early church father Iranaeus, identified the Nicolaitans in his treatise ""Against Heresies"" in the second century as they who are an ""offshoot of the knowledge which is falsely so-called,"" mentioning that they ""lead lives of unrestrained indulgence."" There is no absolute proof that the heretic Nicolas was the Deacon of the same name from Antioch of the seven deacons in the book of Acts, but Iranaeus supposed him to be so. Ignatius mentions the Nicolaitans also, so there was in fact a heretical group existing at that time. Nicolas the deacon was perhaps confused with another Nicolas, the bishop Nicolas of Samaria who was a heretic in the company of Simon Magus.\n\nThe root of the word Nicolaitans comes from Greek nikao, to conquer or overcome, and laos, which means people and which the word laity comes from. The two words together especially means the destruction of the people and refers to the earliest form of what we call a priestly order or clergy which later on in church history divided people and allowed for leadership other than those led by the spirit of the risen Lord Jesus Christ. A good translation of Nicolaitan would be ""those who prevail over the people."" This clerical system later developed into the papal hierarchy of priests and clergy lording over the flock. The Council of Trent stated, ""If anyone shall say that there is not in the Catholic Church a hierarchy established by the divine ordination, consisting of bishops, presbyters and ministers, let him be anathema."" It is not the question of the ministries but rather in the separation of them into a hierarchy over the people. This very idea was taken over by the Protestants with their own corruption of leadership roles and coverings. The Church of Ephesus was commended for hating the deeds of the Nicolaitans. The wrong separation of the clergy from the laity is a great evil in God's sight and He hates the lust for religious power. There is an ungodly spiritual authority in the Church today, which is nothing more than the prideful spirit of control, manipulation, domination and intimidation and a rebellion of the rightful authority of God.\n\nFaithful believers who have put on Christ Jesus, are all God's laity. Peter exhorted us to \n\nFeed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind. Neither as being lords over God's heritage but being examples to the flock. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.\nShepherds serve the sheep but the wolves that clothe themselves with so-called leadership and spiritual authority serve themselves, thinking that they serve God. In essence, this makes them false christs. Early church leaders were established as overseers, not a ruling hierarchy."

Easter isn't about easter baskets and bunny rabbits that hop giving eggs and treats to kids and so forth. So when did the easter bunny become the spokes person for Easter instead of the real reason why we celebrate it... Jesus Christ?","EASTER A BRIEF HISTORY\n\nThe name “Easter” comes to America from Ostera or Eostre, the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring. The origin goes back to 2000 BC in Babylonia honoring the goddess of spring Ishtar. Ishtar the mother/wife of their god Tammuz brought him back from the underworld. In Phoenecia she became Astarte, in Greece Eostre, and in Germany Ostara. Consider also a Phrygian honoring Attis and Cybele or a heretic Israelite honoring the Canaanite Baal and Ashtoreth. All of these are fertility celebrations of death and resurrection.\n\nEASTER IN THE KING JAMES\n\nThe word “Easter” occurs in the King James Bible ONE TIME and is mistranslated. It should be translated PASSOVER.\n\nActs 12:4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. \n\nEaster G3957 pascha (pas'-khah) Of Chaldee origin (compare [H6453]); the Passover (the meal, the day, the festival or the special sacrifices connected with it): - Easter, Passover.\n\nH6453  pesach (peh'-sakh) From H6452; a pretermission, that is, exemption; used only technically of the Jewish Passover (the festival or the victim): - passover (offering).\n\nH6452 pasach (paw-sakh') A primitive root; to hop, that is, (figuratively) skip over (or spare); by implication to hesitate; also (literally) to limp, to dance: - halt, become lame, leap, pass over.\n\nTHE ORIGINAL PASSOVER A SHADOW\n\nExo.12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. Exo.12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. Exo.12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as He hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. Exo.12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? Exo.12:27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. \n\nWhat did it say in Exo.12:26? What mean ye by this service?\n\nWhat did it say in Exo.12:27? It is the SACRIFICE of the LORD'S Passover.\n\nThis was a shadow, that is a silhouette or likeness, of Christ’s crucifixion. Israel was in bondage to the Egyptians. We were in bondage to sin.\n\nCHRIST OUR PASSOVER\n\nI Cor.5:6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? I Cor.5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us: I Cor.5:8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. \n\nChrist our Passover is SACRIFICED for us.\n\nIT IS PROBABLY TRULY DISGUSTING TO FATHER \n\nAs with most Christian holidays, Easter has been secularized and commercialized. We have Easter bunnies, eggs, baskets, bonnets, parades and etc. \n\nKnowing now the origins of Easter, the fallacy of Easter and the sacrifice Christ made for us; I am truly ashamed of myself. We should not be celebrating Easter. We should be celebrating Christ our Passover with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. \n\nWhat is your answer to a child who asks, “What mean ye by this service?” I pray your answer is not Easter.\n\nWhat does God think, about what He sees and hears during this special time of year?"

To sense something is one thing but to actually see it is another. Different religions offer different remedies and I myself have tried a few with some sucess but never attempted to dispell a spirit unless it was obvious that it wanted to do someone harm.

"1","If you won $2 Million after tax in the lottery would you retire?","What would you do?","I would leave my job because with all that money it would be wrong to keep hold of a job that someone with no money or unemployed could do.

A syndicate won quite a few million, l think about 10 employees got about £500'000 each at a local supermarket. But they haven't left their jobs because they feel the company have been good to them and have worked there for donkeys years. The 10 jobs could go to the unemployed people who are desperate for work and trying to live on the dole. Why can't these people help in charity shops, work in animal shelters or open their own business to keep busy?. They may love working on the check-outs - but there are other people that are jobless, it's ridiculous!. So yes, l'd carry on working, but either voluntary or through my own business - after a very long holiday around the world of course!."

I would be convinced if God, with all his infinite power, proved His existence. So why wouldn't He just reveal Himself to people seeking Him? \n\nYou can't really have a relationship with the unproven.\nI keep hearing analogies like if your spouse went away for a week, but you still trust them. Well duh! You already know they exist! Christians, are there any better analogies?","Why doesn't he stand on the side of the road like a billboard?  He does, all of creation testifies to His existance. Study something as simple as a leaf- it's astounding the detail that goes into it.  You seem to like analogies- I do too- so look at it this way: if you see a beautiful Monet, you can admire the brushstrokes, the colors and the composition and no one has to try and convince you that there was an artist!  ""No, no,"" you might say, ""I believe that thousands of years ago all those colors were just thrown into the air and they happened to land on the canvas in this fashion.""  The creation (the painting) testifies to the existance of a painter (the creator)\n\nMatthew 7:7 says if you seek Him you will find Him.  A friend of mine grew up in an orphanage in India and as a small child, wanted to know if there was more to God.  Jesus appeared to Him in a vision and told Him who He was.  Then he began praying for a bible and miraculously enough, some missionaries (this was back in the 1950's- people didn't travel as much as they do today) happened to pass through their small villiage and visit the orphanage so he could have a bible.  He's a missionary now, going to my church and traveling back and forth to India.  \n\nWe have a relationship with God through the Holy Spirit.  It is the Holy Spirit that works on this earth.  I've seen people's deaf ears open. I took a drug dealer to church once, and the power of God there made him start to convulse on the floor- THE NEXT DAY 1.He called all his contacts, 2.quit selling and using drugs and 3. started a street evangelism ministry for the homeless in Houston.  I know God exists because He works in my life- the Holy Spirit can give me a check in my spirit and keep me from going places, and can teach me through revelation. \n\nI have personally prayed for people and God has shown me specific situations in their lives to talk to them about.  One woman I met in a Burger King (she was an employee there) God put it on my heart to pray for her.  As I began to pray I said, ""God let her be a light to Chris."" and she stopped me, took about 3 steps back and wide-eyed asked, ""how did you know my husband's name was Chris?""  Well, I didn't.  I had never met her before; I just prayed what God wanted me to- and He wanted to show her that He knew her, He saw her, He knew her situation and that He cared.  It was pretty cool!\n\n Just yesterday I was reading Psalm 2 about how God fights our battles for us, and I asked Him to do that for me.  Well last night we went to dinner at this restaurant, the food was awful, we were over charged for our meals, but it was such an exhausting day that I didn't feel like fighting our waiter. We still tipped him (since i was a waitress for years) Well the guy comes back with our check copy AND a bag of pasta (the pasta was the large size we'd been charged for, but had not recieved) saying ""the kitchen accidentally made this- you guys want it?""  fresh bread (he hadn't been refilling our bread basket as he should have) and our leftovers.  And my friend, without knowing about my conversation with God that morning said, ""Man, we didn't even have to fight him (the waiter)"" \n\n I know this is an insignificant story, I could tell you more miraculous ones, like how I was woken in the middle of the night to pray for my sister who was busy totaling her car (but walked away with only a small scratch on her knee after clearing a 5' tall fence!) how I was healed of a degenerative family disease, how the power of God has touched my home, but it is the daily testimonies, the small things, that grow our faith. He just wanted me to know yesterday (because of all the battles I'm going through right now) that He cares even for the smallest skirmishes. E-mail me if you want to know more.  I could tell you story after story of the miraculous things God has done.  "
"1","why don't people understand who is their creator?","","We live in a  world that is influenced by Satan and his demons. Satan hates God and Jesus Christ, and he hates mankind. He has put upon people, spiritual blindness and deafness, so that we can't see or hear or understand the Love of our God. What better way to hurt and steal from God, that which Jesus Christ has bought with His life.

"1","Imagine that you were not going to go to Heaven because you committed the unpardonable sin?","Would you still try your best to give glory to God and be thankful to Him for the life you have now?  I wonder how many so called Christians would turn their back on Him if they knew they were not going to Heaven.  Shouldn't we look at what we can do to give glory to God rather than just expecting God to do for us?","Jesus mentions a sin that is unforgivable in Matt. 12:31-32 and calls it blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.\n\nNo. A believer cannot commit the unforgivable sin. How can someone who has been born again (John 3:7), made a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17), and received eternal life (John 10:27-28) actually commit the unforgivable sin? He cannot. Jesus Himself said that we have eternal life, not conditional life: ""My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give eternal life to them, and they shall never perish; and no one shall snatch them out of My hand."" Besides, it says in 2 Cor. 5:17 that the Christian is a new creation in Christ. We are different, no longer slaves to the old nature (Rom. 6:14). We are regenerated by the Holy Spirit.\n     There is no biblical support for a believer committing this sin. It just hasn’t happened. Also, if you are worried that you may have committed the sin and can’t be forgiven, then don’t be concerned. If you are worrying about it, then you haven’t committed it. If you are worried about it, then that is a sign that you have not committed it. If you had, you wouldn’t be concerned."

This is reflected in the following verse\n""Now no person knows what delights of the eye are kept hidden (in reserve) for them - as a reward for their (good) deeds."" Quran 32:17.\n\nSince there is no means to describe heaven, God uses similtitude of things that people likes in this world to describe heaven.\n""A similitude of the Garden which is promised unto those who keep their duty (to Allah): Underneath it rivers flow; its food is everlasting, and its shade; "" Quran 13: 35. \n\nIn earth, sex has got a specific purpose other than enjoyment, that is procreation. There is no need of procreation in heaven so enjoyment there would not be similar to that in earth. There are verses that suggest that will be no weariness in heaven\n\n""And they will say: ""Praise be to God, Who has removed from us (all) sorrow: for our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving Ready to appreciate (service)\n  Who has, out of His Bounty, settled us in a Home that will last: no toil nor sense of weariness shall touch us therein.""

"1","Q about davinci code again....?","what is wrong with the idea that jesus christ was married? is it a sin? does it change him from being jesus christ","No, wouldn't change anything regarding His divinity.  The problem would be in the christians who couldn't accept the fact that He could have been a real man, which He was.  Not a normal man of course, but He was a man in ancient Israel at a time when it would have been extraordinary for any man of His age to have not been married and had kids.  The same principal as the one where Mary was suppose to have been a virgin all her life.  Wouldn't have made sense, especially since He had brothers and sisters, but for some reason, people want to believe that Joseph didn't get the marriage annuled if she'd never sleep with him.  Just kinda silly.\n\nJesus was divine, He rose from the dead and assended into heaven, and the concept that He could have been married and had kids would have nothing to do with that divinity.  I personally don't believe He did marry or have kids, but the idea that He may have would not destroy my faith.  I think a lot of christian's faith relies on what they were taught and they simply can't accept the idea."

"1","God, according to biblical religions is not perfect. Hard to answer questions.?","Adam & Eve experienced reason after eating the fruit of knowledge. Why would God want to create man without reason*? Why is reason given to us by the snake**? Either man was not meant to have reason or man was not ready for reason. When would we be ready for reason? If Eve would never have eaten the fruit, would God eventually have give man the fruit of knowledge***? Or would He allow man to live out their proverbial life in ignorant bliss, like children not aware of the due mortgage and a NSF notice on the checking account.  What was man capable of knowing before he ate the fruit? After man ate the fruit what did he experience differently? Why did God forbid the fruit? A test? Maybe we passed and got free reign of our own destiny? Why did man have to leave Eden**** after eating the forbidden fruit, because we purposefully disobeyed God? Was leaving Eden the result of receiving reason? Did we know that that was the punishment? Did God make us aware of the complications of eating the forbidden fruit, or were we too ignorant to understand such a complicated concept? Did we do an “Awwww, Damn!” When we realized what we did, did Adam slap Eve. B-itch! Was the forbidden fruit, sex? Did Adam knock up Eve and gained reason when she missed a month. No wait. That was her punishment – the menstrual cycle and a painful child birth. Why would God give some women a death sentence, then? That’s not a loving god. Why are people expected to love a god that might punish your wife at child birth for the sins of the first woman eons ago? \n\n*Is reason a gift? Ignorance is Bliss – child? Not aware.\n\n**Who is the snake? Why a snake? Fear of reptiles? Species stereotype. Why would we have fear for one of God’s creatures? Some snakes are genetically engineered “Badass, f--k you up killing machines (example: spitting cobra)” that’s why!\n\n***Is there a parallel reality where man actually didn’t eat the fruit? F--k theory M.\n\n****Where was Eden, is Eden susceptible to climate change? Would climate be changing if man never ate the fruit? Why fruit? Isn’t fruit positive? What is real forbidden fruit, poison vegetation?","Temptation is the forbidden fruit."

"1","Why can't God be a woman?","If God the creator is a man, wouldn't it follow that men should be the ones creating life by giving birth? \n\nAccording to some, we were created in God's image, if I'm not mistaken.","I wrote a paper about language used for God while I was in college, I'll just paste parts of it in here where it fits in between my thoughts now.\n\nGod being referred to as a man is a perfect example of the overuse of a metaphor. the metaphor is supposed to bring out certain feelings and allow the reader to relate better to the subject at hand. the overuse of a metaphor obviously proves to have problems, when in this case, referring to God as a woman somehow tends to turn heads.\n\nit seems everyone is hitting it with saying that God is neither male nor female. biblically, there are referrences to giving God both male and female characteristics, as well as comparisons to animals and inanimate objects. God is all things. whoever quoted the I Am scripture got it right.\n\nmale references:\n\n""Along with God as a father, there are other male images for God in the Bible. God is referred to as a shepherd in Psalm 23 and Ezekiel 34 (103). God is referred to as “. . . LORD Most High, the great King over all the earth” in Psalm 47:2 and a judge and king in Psalm 96:10 (103-104). God is portrayed to have great strength and courage. In Psalm 24:8, God is referenced as being a warrior. It says, “Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.”""\n\nfemale references:\n\n""God is also referred to in feminine aspects. In Isaiah 49:15, God is given the characteristics of a nursing mother. Isaiah 66:13, states that “As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem” (104). God is given the characteristics of a midwife in Psalm 22:9-10 and gives birth in Deuteronomy 32:18 and Isaiah 42:14. Characteristics of women by giving birth can also be found in John 3, when God gave his “only begotten son.”""\n\nanimal references:\n\n""God is also equated with animals throughout the Old and New Testaments. In Matthew 23, as well as Luke 13, God is spoken of as a mother hen gathering her chicks under her wings. In Deuteronomy 32 God is referenced to be a mother eagle, and then again a few animal references are made in Hosea 13:7-8. It states, “So I will come upon them like a lion, like a leopard I will lurk by the path. Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them and rip them open. Like a lion I will devour them; a wild animal will tear them apart” (98).""\n\ninanimate object references:\n\n""Throughout the Bible God is also referenced as inanimate objects. In Deuteronomy 4:24, God is “a consuming fire” and in Psalm 84 God is “a sun and shield” (98). In Deuteronomy 32, God is a rock. However, “‘Rock’ applied to God implies a set of qualities, particularly ones that focus on stability and reliability, that rose in the consciousness of the believing community at a particular time” (102).""\n\nit is also important to note that God's name, which is ""’ehyeh ‘asher ‘ehyeh,"" or roughly YHWH is found over 6,000 times in the old testament. it is roughly and most often translated as ""I am (who I am),"" and is a form of ""to be."" due to the fact that jews regarded God's name as sacred and should never have been spoken, they often substituted YHWH with ""Adonai"" (which is ""kyrios"" in greek and ""dominus"" in latin). all of those forms are masculine and translate as ""lord."" lord obviously has masculine, dominant conotations. since all these forms are masculine, the masculine idea of God was pushed over God's name. God is often also referred to as ""elohim"" which has no gender. the shortened, ""eloh,"" however is feminine and means goddess, so the addition of ""im"" at the end could make the translation of the word merely mean, “god,” “gods,” “goddess,” or “diety.”\n\nwhoever stated that the term for spirit was ruah and was feminine was also correct. it is important to note that the spiri"

My truck veered off the highway. As soon as I felt the truck leave the highway, I woke up and found I was heading downward on the gravel part of the side of the highway.

His grandson, Patrick, was created Baron Glamis in 1445 and the 9th Lord Glamis was created Earl of Kinghorne in 1606.  \n\nThe 3rd Earl, a Lord of the Treasury and an Extraordinary Lord of Session, was created Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon, Lord Glamis, Tannadyce, Sidlaw and Strathdichtie in 1677.  \n\nThe family, once the richest in Scotland, spent its fortune in the English Civil War. In the 18th century, it recovered when the 9th Earl married a wealthy heiress by the name of Mary Eleanor Bowes. The family name was then changed from Lyon to Bowes. But as soon as the first Bowes died, the 11th Earl changed the name to Lyon-Bowes. The 13th Earl eventually changed it to Bowes-Lyon."

All the pastors ever did was talk about how if we did one bad thing and did not ask forgiveness, we were going to ""hell"". People who did not accept Jesus...""going to hell"". \n\nSame thing with Islam. ""Non-beleivers"", oh, they get to kill us by law of their Qu'ran, PLUS we all go to hell. Double Jeapordy!\n\nI read a portion of the Upanishads that speaks of a hell for the unfaithful and/or unbeleivers. Wow.\n\nI beleive in a Supreme Being, ""God"" if you will. Why would that Great Being create us Human Man, and desire for us to be divided by  worship? It makes no sense. All these things were put here for all of us on Earth, and yet, we war and fight in the name of religions, divided by our view of ""GOD"", even the lack thereof.  Shouldn't this quest be a personal one? Shouldn't one's relationship with their creator be divine unto itself, and need no restrictive guideline to fall into?","Yes, I totally agree that organized religion is divisive and exclusive.  And that our spirituality and quest for a relationship with God is personal.\n\nOrganized religions teach us to live fear-based lives in order to control the masses and advance their own agenda.  They teach people to be mindless sheep and just accept what they are told without question.  They teach us to hate people who follow other religions.  Hate is not God.  Love is God.  We are all on different paths and different points on those paths to the same place.  God.\n\nI feel that if we are really to follow Christ's teaching we will love our neighbour as ourself and leave the judgments to God.  I don't personally believe in a place called hell.  \n\nI think we create our own hell for ourselves within ourselves.  Hell is here on earth.  Where people kill in the name of God (or whatever name they give God).  \n\nI can never accept within my heart that God loves some and not others or that God loves some more than others.  No.  God created us all and loves all of her creations.  \n\nAs far as hell goes, I think that if people believe in hell, they will get it, because our beliefs are powerful creators of our own reality.\n\nI believe in God/Life/Love.  I am trying to live a love-based life, and not a fear-based one as taught by organized religion."

"1","Da Vinci Code...should I read the book? watch the movie? or neither?","I am trying to decide if I should stay away from the hype, but it's every where.","The book is an excellent mystery that will keep you turning the pages.  I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie because the movie may be hard to follow if you have not read the book.  At least for me it would have been.\n\nFirst thing you must realize if you are going to read the book, is that it is fiction, and should be taken as FICTION ONLY.  Even though there may be parts which ARE true, you should not get your information about history, religion, and art from a book of fiction.  Absolutely assume that it is all fiction.  Then if you want to later find out where the truth is, you'll just have to do the work of consulting scholarly works, history books, and the Bible as well as the other Gospels that did not make it into the Bible.\n\nSo if you are looking for a good fiction and awesome mystery story, read it and see it.  If you are looking only for historical truth on the matters covered, then do not read it or see it, because it is a terrible source for factual information.  As I say, even though some of the information may be true, you won't be able to know the truth from the falsehood, and there is DEFINITELY falsehood in the book.  Afterall, it IS a fiction novel."

However humans and apes do share a common ancestor.  This ancestor was not human or ape but it was the foundation from which they both evolved on two separate and distinct paths (evolutionary tracts). In fact most people have heard the apes are the closest species related to humans, but the truth is, Chimpanzees are the closet to us, genetically, physically and in mental capabilities. Apes and Humans diverged on separate evolutionary tracks about 8 million years ago while Humans and Chimps only diverged at about 5 million yrs ago.\nThere is a 4% genetic-sequence difference between chimps and Humans, which means that our DNA is 96% identical. But we did not evolve from one another, we just shared a distant, now extinct relative.  Hope this clears things up."

Imagine a village where the needs of the village include fishing, home building, cooking, pottery making, weaving, hunting, etc. We could imagine everyone trying to do everything, but we'd soon see that it just makes more sense for some people to spend more time doing the things they are good at. But for them to trade this gets difficult. A close-knit village might manage it, but a larger group needs some way of keeping track of who does what. Some systems just have everyone pitch in. This can be a logistical challenge. Other systems, like capitalism, allow people to earn their own living. They need currency to make trading more efficient. (otherwise you'd have to try to pay the home-builder in fish, and a person can only handle so many fish.)"

For instance, I worked with Americans for most of my working life, and I found the people I worked with to be intelligent and hard-working.  I was always amazed by their sheer enthusiasm and stamina.  I had good energy levels, but they left me behind.  So ..... I would say that from my own experience I made lots of friends (I still e-mail friends on the East and West coast to this day).\n\nHowever, there is a broad concept in the British Isles that most Americans are dumb and loud-mouthed.  That they are war-mongerers, and greedy.  That they pollute the planet with their gas-guzzling cars and will not sign the Kyoti Agreement because it will affect their lives too dramatically.  In London the American Embassy has refused to pay the London traffic congestion charge because they have deemed it a tax ... notwithstanding that every single Londoner has to pay this charge and it is more in the way of a toll than a tax.  So .... all around me I hear complaints about Americans, but I have nothing but good experiences.\n\nMost people here (as in America I am sure) generalise.  Not all Brits have bad teeth, for example!!!!"

I am a Classics Major, and have participated in Archaeological digs. I appreciate any bit of history. Aha! Keyword there- history. Just because you found something that could be an ark does not prove God exists. I'm sorry. The bible was written by man, therefore is loaded with flaws and corruption. It is mans interpretation of what was supposed to be God's word. Therefore, it is WRITTEN HISTORY. Of course some of the stories hold truths, because they were written by men! Of course they will include something like a MASSIVE FLOOD. It still doesn't prove God exists.  It could prove there was a massive flood(which we already know has happened on several occasions..melting of the ice caps, perhaps?) and ""Noah"" built it to stay safe. And, maybe Noah did exist. Do you know him personally? I don't. He could have been a raving lunatic listenign to voices in his head, or had seizures (remember your nice 'friend' Saul? I mean Paul? Those were seizures!)","No. god decided to contradict himself by taking away free will for a bit, so he could get the humans to write his book for him.\nAnd of course, that's ignoring all the inconsistancies in the new testament, like made up prophesies and the evidence to support that the old testament was actually copied from ancient Sumerian stone tablets...\n\n:)\n\nTY, shawny  :D"

"1","What do you consider taking up an offence?","In the Bible we are told to not take up an offence.  I have always found it interesting that if you follow the command to take up your cross you would have to lay it down to take up the offence.  As a Christian, laying down my cross is something I don't want to do, so I try very hard to not take up an offence.","Quiet Warrior,\n\nYou have a very good way to look at it. I am reminded that Jesus said, “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.” He was certainly asking His Father not to charge His judges and tormentors and executioners with their offenses against Him, but also they REALLY didn’t understand what they were doing.\n\nIt is very easy to see that they offended Him, but not quite so easy to see that they really didn’t understand what they were doing. Pilate seemed to have a sense that he condemned an innocent man; the high priest uttered prophetically, “It is better for one man to die for all the people,” and the crowd shouted, “His blood be upon us and our children.” One of the thieves realized that Jesus was a good man, and even one of the Roman soldiers realized after Jesus died that He was really the Son of God.\n\nHowever, none of them really understood the significance of what they were doing. That is also true of the people who offend us no matter how deliberate or shrewd they are. If people really understood the nature of their acts, then they wouldn’t do them.\n\nWe all look at an event like 9/11 and are horrified by the carnage, and it is incredible to us that anyone could commit such acts. Osama bin Laden and the other masterminds and perpetrators, in spite of their obvious planning and forethought, had no real concept of what they were doing. If they had your understanding, then they couldn’t have done it, could they?\n\nI can’t understand serial killers or child molesters or rapists or men who hit women, etc. The only way to really understand those things is to be capable of doing them, so I’m thankful that I don’t understand the way they think. By the same token, they don’t understand the way you or I think. It is foreign to them. If they really understood what they were doing then they couldn’t do it, could they?\n\nAnyway, this line of thinking helps me to forgive just as yours does. It is also good to see that if I don’t forgive others, then God can’t forgive me. That’s a really good motivator.\n\nGod bless."

"1","Where did the F word originate and was it originally used as another word for sex?","","F**k is an English word which, when used literally as a verb, means ""to engage in sexual intercourse"". It is generally considered to be an offensive profanity. Its origins may be Germanic, akin to the synonymous German ""ficken"", which had the original meaning, ""to strike"".\n\nIt is unclear whether the word has always been considered vulgar, and if not, when it first started to be considered vulgar. Some evidence indicates that in some English-speaking locales it was considered acceptable as late as the 17th century meaning ""to strike"" or ""to penetrate"". Other evidence indicates that it may have become vulgar as early as the 16th century in England, although neither set of evidence is inherently contradictory to the other, since many words have multiple connotations. The etymology (origin) of the word is uncertain.\n\nThere are several urban-legend false etymologies postulating an acronymic origin for the word. One legend holds that the word f**k came from Irish law. If a couple were caught committing adultery they would be punished ""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge In the Nude"", with ""F U C K I N'"" written on the stocks above them to denote the crime."

I can personally attest that this is true in my life and in the life of my children.\n\nBut remember that this is in the Old Testament.

"1","The legacy of colonization?","Are the problems of modern Africa the result of colonization by the European powers in the late 19th century, or did Africa derive more benefit than harm from colonization?","Yes. Europeans imported the concept of nationalism to Africa, which is meaningless to people that have expressed loyalty toward their own ethnic group or culture than their ""nation"". If you look at a place like Nigeria, there are several different languages spoken there besides English.\n  At the Berlin Conference of 1888, when European nations carved up Africa for themselves, that did it irregardless of the cultures in the region. Nationalism is one issue that African nations are going to adjust to.\n  Also, I would have to agree with the first answer, European customs have done away with the modes of government that have worked for them, long before Europe was even interested in African colonization.\n  Another issue is the issue of education. Europe used Africa for raw goods and resources and left Africans in a poor position to function well on their own. One example is the Congo. The Belgians robbed the Congo of their natural resources( Congo is one of the most resource abundant nations on Earth, yet it is one of the poorest) and left the Congelese uneducated. All of the professionals in the Congo such as doctors, etc were all Belgian.By analogy, Botswana also was colonized by Britain, and they are well-educated and have incorporated ancient customs with Western ideas.\n  In short, nationalism, education, and erosion of some of Africa's ancient forms of government are some of the causes of the problems in Africa today."

I go over to the water pipe and I turn off the water...I stop the flood.  As I pass a window, I see an antelope.  He stands up but his leg or hoof is broken and he just looks at me.  He trys to come over to the window but can't and so he sits back down.  I know the Antelope means to 'do' something.  But if the antelope is hobbled, does that mean by my stopping the flood( of information), I have halted my abilty to 'do'?  or IF I stop the flow..see what i am getting at?

My advice is to look at all the information that is coming into your life and only keep what feels truly good in your heart."

(not lower level courses).","I haven't taken any such course in Spanish, but I have for other languages.  Advanced courses frequently don't have textbooks because textbooks explain grammar and have short readings and exercises.  At the higher levels of language, you're expected to know the grammar, so you might use a grammar *reference* but not a textbook, and you'll probably be reading real literature instead of readings constructed to use limited vocabulary.  And your composition assignments will probably be defined by the teacher.  \n\nI can recommend this book for advanced grammar reference: A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish, by John Butt and Carmen Benjamin."
"1","When you're in a shopping mall, is it easy to tell what city or state you're in?","If you were to walk into four shopping malls in vastly different areas of the US, would it be easy for you tell--for example if you were in Buffalo, Minneapolis, Denver, Seattle or Mobile?","Except for speech patterns of the customers, and the obvious difference in apparel--like tons of winter stuff up north and none of it down here in the south--today's malls are clones.   Even the strip malls look the same.  \n\nI travel a lot, and it's almost impossible to tell where I am anymore by the interior or exterior of a mall.   The newer strip malls in Florida all strive to look like Miami-cool, even in Pensacola or St. Augustine.   I think it's a shame that they don't play up the differences and uniqueness of a city, but these malls are apparently also the work of the developers who spin out the cookie cutter housing developments.    Ever tried to find a specific house in a new development where you can't see the house numbers?  \n\nIn Florida, just look for the split level, pink/gray or sand color stucco exterior with white trim, with requisite garage as you first turn in the driveway.....good luck.   I like the older neighborhoods that have a little character.  I also like it better when the post offices were in older buildings, instead of the blue and brick clone, and when I could tell if I was in California or Florida or Detroit.\n\nOh well.

"1","Why does church take some books so offensively if, sometimes, they are fiction?","","I think the church has a lot of different motivations for why they take offense to certain books.  There is the simple offense, where people deem certain content inappropriate because it is morally questionable.  For example, a group of parents discover a book that includes violence or sex inappropriate for their children and want to protest or boycott to have the offensive content removed.  The motivation is straight forward not surreptitious.  The solution is to restrict expose for the children you are responsible for, but it is extreme to try to decide what is appropriate for other people.  The second reason is not so pure.  The church may fear the challenge of different ideas.  They may feel that it weakens their power or control over people and situations.  Case in point, literature that is pro-birth control or not anti-abortion may be banned by the church because it challenges what they say and they may loose control over people when individuals read the information and become educated by the information.  The church used to only allow the Bible to be translated into Latin so that only a select few could read it and they would only share ideas that they wanted people to be exposed to.  This gave them control to manipulate the masses; it robbed people of their right to make their own decisions and to educate themselves.  I believe the church still engages in this practice and it is manifested in the church becoming offended and banning."

"1","How were other religions formed???","After the first religion that was started after Jesus' death? Where can I find information about it???","1)  Christianity was NOT the first religion.  \n2)  Judaism was technically not the first religion, either.  Judaism did not come about until Moses.  While God was worshiped before Moses, as we read in the Bible, there was no formal religion.  Adam, Noah, Joshua, etc., had no formal religion as we typically think of; therefore, when Pagans claim that their religion is the oldest, technically they are correct, and the Bible confirms it.\n3)  Other religions start for various reasons.  L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology) and Joseph Smith (Mormonism) seemed to be financially motivated.  Islam seemed to be more racially motivated.  Most New Age and modern Pagan beliefs seem to be motivated by the desire to BE God (they desire ""special power"").  That is really what almost all false beliefs (including most false religious sects) are about...  getting to be God.  Deciding for one self what is right and wrong.  Wanting to be like God.  That is what Satan tempted Eve with in the Garden, and that is what drives us away today."

And I would probably say that Christianity has been used to justify the deaths of more people than Islam.  Terrorists pluck off a few at a time, maybe a thousand in a big attack.

"1","Are people basically good or evil and why do you think this is so?","","I think that all people are good. For some reasons some of them follow the good some others evil or bad. It deppens on their life, religion, mind, education e.t.c Theories of goodness inquire into what sorts of things are good, and what the word ""good"" really means in the abstract.\nAll religions and most philosophical movements have been concerned with good to some degree. It can define ""good"" and ""bad"" for a community or society. It affects everyone's life, and maybe all life on Earth, in the way people organize themselves in societies, and even how they think.\n\nThe duality of 'good versus evil' is expressed, in some form or another, by many cultures. This concept describes a hierarchy of moral standards applied to human behaviour. In more casual  use, the word ""evil"" can characterize people and behaviours that are hurtful, ruinous, or disastrous. Those who believe in the duality theory of evil believe that evil cannot exist without good, nor good without evil, as they are both objective states and opposite ends of the same scale.\n\nIn modern slang, ""bad"" has become a synonym for ""good"", as in ""Man, that's a bad piece of music.""  The ability to choose between good and evil is also a major theme of the philosophy. \nIn our life we have this abbility and we try to follow the better way. Usually our good is not your good.\nIf you want to learn more see Wikipedia"
"1","Why is agnosticism the fastest growing ""Religion"" in the world?","Objective reasons only, please. No sermons.","I am sorry you have received some really harsh answers to this question.  I believe your answer can be found in the definition of agnosticism.  \n\nThe doctrine that certainty about first principles or absolute truth is unattainable and that only perceptual phenomena are objects of exact knowledge. \n\nThe belief that there can be no proof either that God exists or that God does not exist.\n\nAsk yourself one more question, especially in regards to the root of all churches, the Catholic Church.  What is it they claim their Holy Trinity to be?  He or They are the answer to all questions.  The beginning to understanding and the end to suffering.  This to me is a wonderful belief to hold.  It gives some a sense of comfort.  However, this belief for many is difficult to understand given scientific reasoning, current global situations, and the reputation of the Christian faith.\n\nAgnostics are easy to equate in this manner.  Say you had been blind your entire life, and all your life everyone told you the sky was blue.  You would form this idea of an unidentified ""blue.""  Then one-day science comes along with a cure for your ailment.  The first thing you want to see is the sky.  When you look at it, it looks nothing like your idea of ""blue.""  Had you been wrong your entire life?  No.  Your concept of the idea of ""blue"" has no shifted from an idea to a reality.  Same thing with agnostics.  They have an idea of a higher power.  Yet since they have not physical proof of this power, it remains an idea.  Nothing more than that.\n\nI hope this helps."

"1","The clash of  parents and children.?","This clash is between Chinese parents and Chinese-American children. This can occur as a result of differences in the birthplaces or be a simple result of time (among other issues). How does this affect the children in comparison to your culture?","It really depends upon the culture. I knew a girl who was Saudi, but raised in Venezuela (another culture repressive to women). She was a student of mine in college and clashed frequently w/her traditional parents, since she wanted to become a doctor. \n\nKids and parents of all cultures usually clash, to some degree or another. Even parents (like a lot of aging Hippies I know!) who are pretty loose on discipline, have fights with their kids and sometimes the kids suffer from not enough discipline, whereas in our culture, it's usually TOO MUCH discipline (esp. if kids are hit...that's just wrong!). \n\nWhat you're describing sounds like basically the same thing that every immigrant group has gone through in some form: the older generation wants to keep tradition but the younger generation wants to be Americanized. \n\nThe main thing is to realize the kids aren't doing this out of lack of love or respect. You need to let them go and mesh with the new society, but be there for them if they need a place to come back to, and they usually do. \n\nDon't alienate your kids just because they're not exactly like you!"

Is it because they fear others who are different and believe they think as different as their appearances may be?","It is because they are too full of themselves that they judge others. I have also noted at times that they fear those who are different in appearance and thinking. I judge people by how they treat others and not how they look."

"1","What do you think of this....?","I know several people that are getting medicaid, foodstamps and other forms of welfare because they are not married and have children. What the government does not know is that these women are kliving with the father of their children and these men make plenty of money to support them and they do. I think this is disgusting and unfair to those people out there who really need help, they should be ashamed of theirselves. what do you think and do you think that the government should maybe do a little more investigating before approving these people.","agree with you. It's something I think about quite a lot. Where I come from to work is kind of a privledge and a pain in the ass at the same time, but taxes do take a sizeable chunk out of anyone's income. People on a benefit admittedly do not receive a large income, but it's a pain in the ass when they say that they should be on one because ""boo hoo"" they are a single parent or whatever. And when the people who are working and basically, apart from all the rest of it, paying for them through their taxes, quite possibly have things which they could choose to say ""boo hoo"" about also. Anyway - that is just regarding your basic everyday run of the mill single parent family, which honestly probably does need quite a lot of help. If someone is together with someone else and passing themselves off as single so they can claim more benefits, then that is shitty yes. If they have plenty of money coming from someone else I don't think they should be chasing welfare stamps as a lifestyle option."

"1","Shadow people?","Have you ever witnessed a shadow person when other people were around and you all are convinced you saw it?","Shadow people are rather disturbing. I find it completely strange that every story I hear of shadow people are incredibly similar... even from people who would never believe in that kind of thing... and have never even heard of shadow people before. A friend of mine explained her experience to me. She discribed it as a solid black figure, tall, standing on her stair case. She also explained it as wearing a cape (later on I found out that it is common for shadow people to be discribed as hooded) I had at the time never heard of anything like this before. Then a few months later another friend brought it up... this time he knew something about them. After that I did my own research... The stories check out... but the question remains- What are they? Most interestingly they are a relitively recent phenomenon. I am thinking that they are something quite separate from ghosts... I have never heard of someone being physically harmed by a shadow person.. but people do find them terrorfying. Who knows what they are! I know this doesn't answer your question... but I hope it helps."

I belive in freedom of religion. And I don't have one. Why is that such a bad thing for religious people? Same with people who believe in the devil. They say the same thing. Why is religion such an important thing? It only seperates different religious people. This is the same as racism in a sense. Racism is when you think one race is better than the other and with religion believers of god believe they are better than people who dont have a religion. I don't understand how they are better if they are like this. Religion should be a choice, not a neccesity. Noone should have to be told what they belive in. Why does the USA revolve around god? They right IN GOD WE TRUST on money and make you swear to god in court. I don't have anything against people with a religion, but it bothers me that they try to force it on others.","God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to."

"1","Does Morality Depend Upon Religion?","Would like to know if Religion fosters morality or is morality inherant in human being?","Wow, what a great question.  Let's first see if we can 'agree' on what morality means.  The traditional definition is that morality means a system or set of beliefs that define what is good or bad.\n\nTo that end, religion and religious traditions, whether Eastern or Wester, certainly due provide a system of beliefs in what is right or wrong - or morality.\n\nThe real question, is this . . . which religious tradition (i.e., Judeo-Christian, Hindu, Islamic, etc.,) provides the ""best"" system for morality? To answer that question ones must become familiar with the sacred writing and teachings of a given relgious tradition.\n\nMust morality depnd on religion exclusively?  Not necessarily, but it is hard to think of one signficant moral tradition or belief (e.g., don't steal, don't kill) that is not rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition.\n\nI believe the statement that morality is relative is simply ridiculous.  Moral traditions created by man are relative; but the Judeo-Christian view is that God gave the Law and thus Judeo-Christian morality is based on the character and nature of God, which is anything but relative.  God is absolute, and the final authroity on what is true, good or not."

Instead, the focus drifts toward diversity, sensitivity, and other sch nonsense.

"1","who has seen the DaVinci Code? What do you think about the theory?","","Da Vinci Code Broken?\n\nDa Vinci Code controversy - It is everywhere! Dan Brown's book claims Jesus in not divine or God, and the gospels as we know them, have been changed, and after Jesus stay here on earth, men raised his status to the level of God. Could any of this be true?\n\nAncient secrets of the Church, hidden for centuries have actually been revealed and published in books prior to the fictional writings of Brown in the Da Vinci Code. Baigent and Leigh have produced other books from researchers point of view over the last two decades, including ""Dead Sea Scrolls Deception"", ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"", and ""Messianic Legacy."" These books were the talk of the religious communities when they came out in the early 90's and certianly they have fueled an ongoing interest into just exactly who was this man Jesus, what was his message and what happened to him?\n\nIslam claims to ""break the code"" so to speak, over 1,400 years ago. The answer, according to Muslm scholars has been in the Quran for over fourteen hundred years \n\nSome may be surprised to learn, Muslims believe in the miracle birth and other miracles associated with Jesus. They actually consider him as the ""Messiah"" and they even say, ""peace be upon him"" when mentioning his name. However, they are quick to negate any connection between God and Jesus as a partnership or God-head, and they rule out the notion of God having any son (or daughter for that matter).\n\nHere is how Muslim scholars present their understanding and ""break the code"": \n\nHow Muslim scholars ""broke the code"": \n\nCreation itself tells us there is a creator and from the beginning of time – Allah, (the One God in Arabic) alone is to be worshiped. This is clear teaching throughout the Old testament (Torah), the scriptures that Jesus himself read and taught from. God is one not one of three; for example: ‘He is God; there is no other besides Him’. (Deuteronomy 4:35). The same is mentioned in the book of Mark in the New Testament, chapter 12, verse 29, when Jesus, peace be upon him, had been asked about the Greatest Commandment he replied, ""To know, O Israel, the Lord your God is One Lord; and you have to love Him with all your heart and all your mind and all your strength.""\n\nAccording to the oldest and most authentic copies of manuscipts and scrolls available throughout the centuries, Jesus, peace be upon him, never claimed to be God, or the creator, or the One to pray to, nor did he tell his followers to revere him as God. These notions appear on the lips of others who came along decades and even centuries later. \n\nWhile Jesus was on earth he did not claim to be the creator or ask us to revere him as God. His miraculous birth is a sign of his prophethood: “Verily, the likeness of Jesus before Allah, is the likeness of Adam. He (Allah) created him from dust and said “Be!” and he was” (Quran 3:59). Like all the great and noble prophets of Allah such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, Isaac and David, Jesus came with one message: Worship, love, obey and submit to the one true God, Allah, the creator of everything and do not worship anything besides Allah.\n\nThroughout history, people have taken to worship things or people alongside Allah, or just worshiping something else like power, status or money. Even the names of religions seem have more to do with the creation and less or nothing to do with the Creator. For example: Buddhism – Buddha (the name of a man), Confucianism – Confucius (the name of a man), Hinduism – Hind (the name of an area), Judaism – Judah (the name of a tribe) and Christianity – Christ (the name of a great prophet).\n\nIslam is different. Islam is a word coming from the verb ""aslama"" and it carries the meaning of ""surrender"", ""submission"", ""obedience"", ""sincerity"" and ""peace"" between you and Almighty Alla"

We are not vegetables, nor minerals, we are animals and animals do not behave like other animals of another specie.\n\nFear and anger are instincts.

Salvation comes through the Lord.\n\nAs for temple rites, they are not secret.  They are SACRED.  that means very special and important, and of God - so they ought not to be spoken of carelessly.  everyone is welcome to go to the temple, as soon as they have prepared.\n\n[as for that stuff on tv, etc (that some individuals answering earlier have referred to) - please.  that stuff is so not true.  and the people perpetuating those false ideas know it.  and God knows it, and he knows they know it.\n\nif you want to learn about mormonism, inquire from current authorities in mormonism.  to use an analogy, what kind of information about american history or culture do you think you would get if, instead of talking to americans, you asked Al Qaida?  come on, now, people.]\n\nGod lives.

"1","Going Crazy..?","I am a 27 year old male and a crossdresser. I am surprised to even find myself doing this.\nI feel stupid to say ""I dont know if im gay or not"". I have fantasies about men (being a girl and not), and got off to a few guys before. I've never actually had physical contact with another guy. If I find out I'm not, I will be devastated because I will have felt I was faking it all these years. WTF DO I DO? And please, It's not a sin for all the close-minded, just in case you'd like to know. I don't think people would kill themselves because of what they CHOOSE to be. Just makes sense to me. Thank you.","Dude, if you're going to be that explicit, don't be so vague in the title.  That was disgusting for me to read, and I didn't even finish the whole thing.  ""Going crazy?"" seems like something completely different.  \n\nLook, I'm not trying to trash you though.  Maybe you have vagina-envy.  If it feels natural, you should think about pursuing a sexual relationship with a man, and seeing.  Cross-dressing does not mean you are gay, but it definately doesn't mean that you're not.  You should find out yourself, because no one else can answer this for you and just accept yourself for whatever you are.  There's nothing wrong with being gay, and there's nothing wrong with being not gay.\n\nIf you find that simply fantasizing about being a woman(sorry hard for me to think about) and having men is all you like, and actually don't like being with a man, that's ok, too.  Keep on fantasizing if you like it.  You may find that you are a female trapped in a man's body.  There's no way to tell.  The reason for all the confusion is because you're telling yourself that you need to be a certain way, which is rubbish.  Thinking you need to be a certain way is purely influence and it's not natural.  We are what we are, and the only way to be wrong in what you are is living a lie.  Find the truth, and love it because the truth is beautiful, no matter what the truth is.  The truth will set you free.  This may be a cliche, but it's true.  \n\nKnow this;  Most things you believe to be a necessity, you find later to be unnecessary.

"1","why do people celebrate Christmas if its not even mention in the bible?","","THE ORIGIN OF CHRISTMAS\n\nIt was not until several hundred years after Jesus lived on the earth that people began to commemorate his birth on December 25. But that was not the date of Jesus’ birth.\n\nConsider the weather conditions at that time of the year in Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The Jewish month of Chislev (corresponding to November/December) was a month with cold and rainy weather. The month after that was Tebeth (December/January). It saw the lowest temperatures of the year, with occasional snows in the highlands. Let us see what the Bible tells us about the climate of that region.\nThe Bible writer Ezra shows that Chislev was indeed a month known for cold and rainy weather. After stating that a crowd had gathered in Jerusalem “in the ninth month [Chislev] on the twentieth day of the month,” Ezra reports that people were “shivering . . . on account of the showers of rain.” Concerning weather conditions at that time of the year, the congregated people themselves said: “It is the season of showers of rain, and it is not possible to stand outside.” (Ezra 10:9, 13; Jeremiah 36:22) No wonder shepherds living in that part of the world made sure that they and their flocks were no longer out of doors at night when December came around!\nThe Bible reports, however, that shepherds were in the fields tending their flocks on the night of Jesus’ birth. In fact, the Bible writer Luke shows that at that time, shepherds were “living out of doors and keeping watches in the night over their flocks” near Bethlehem. (Luke 2:8-12) Notice that the shepherds were actually living out of doors, not just strolling outside during the day. They had their flocks in the fields at night. Does that description of outdoor living fit the chilly and rainy weather conditions of Bethlehem in December? No, it does not. So the circumstances surrounding Jesus’ birth indicate that he was not born in December.\n\nSo why was December 25 chosen? Some who later claimed to be Christian likely “wished the date to coincide with the pagan Roman festival marking the ‘birthday of the unconquered sun.’” (The New Encyclopædia Britannica) In winter, when the sun seemed weakest, pagans held ceremonies to get this source of warmth and light to come back from its distant travels. December 25 was thought to be the day that the sun began its return. In an effort to convert pagans, religious leaders adopted this festival and tried to make it seem “Christian.”\n\nThe pagan roots of Christmas have long been recognized. Because of its unscriptural origin, Christmas was banned in England and in some of the American colonies during the 17th century. Anyone who even stayed home from work on Christmas day had to pay a penalty. Soon, though, the old customs were back, and some new ones were added. Christmas once again became a big holiday, and that is what it still is in many lands. Because of the connections that Christmas has with false religion, however, those who want to please God do not celebrate it or any other holiday that has its roots in pagan worship.\n\nhttp://www.watchtower.org/library/w/2000/12/15/article_01.htm\n\n\n."
"1","Why do people move to the west, but hate freedoms and modernity?","","I think it's weird too. I think they move because they know that the west is a better place to live, more money, better healthcare, better education, and tolerant of religious diversity.\n\nBut some of them, when they arrive, they complain about how immoral it is and how it conflicts with their religious ideals and corrupts their children. \n\nIt's all part of the same package, if you don't want to be 'tainted' by our immorality or have your children growing up in our culture, you shouldn't move here. If you move to another country you should be respectful of their culture. If you don't agree with it don't go."
"1","What do you think about Indonesia??","","I think Indonesia is a beautiful country with very nice, friendly people. It has a very interesting culture and great places to visit. An of course the food is excellent!  I have been travelling though Indonesia for two months and I had a great time. I went to Java, where I visited Jakarta, a very busy city with a rich history. I also went to Bandung, where you can buy custom made jeans, really great! Yogjakarta is a beautiful town as well, with a lot of culture, really the cultural capital of Java! I also visited Bali. Bali is partly very touristic, for example the beach resorts Kuta, Sanur of Jimbaran. However, I loved the seafood in Jimbaran and had a great time in Kuta. I also enjoyed my time in Ubud, an artistic village in the middle of rice fields on Bali. Beautiful sights and I was fascinated by the Balinese culture and their religion, Hinduism. The Gili islands are great for diving and snorkeling. For peace and quiet, visit Gili Meno or Gili Air, if you want some more action, Gili Trawangan is maybe more for you. Anyway, all three islands look like real Bounty islands and you feel as if you are in the add...\nI would recommend everyone to visit Flores. What a beautiful island, with not that much tourism yet. People are very friendly, nature is breathtaking (for example watching the sunrise on the Kelimutu volcano, a great experience!) and the sights are so interesting.\nI really love Indonesia and find it a very diverse country. I was very sorry to hear about the earthquake and I really hope that Indonesia will have less problems with nature and disasters in the future, it definetly does not deserve it."

"1","Why is it that...?","When I ask ""How would God feel about one person on His planet calling another person on His planet an 'illegal alien' ?"" ...I get a lot of answers that state: He would agree with that, because God wants us to follow to laws of the country...\n\nBut when it's about gay marriage, it's all of a sudden allowed to try to use God's Word to change the laws of the country.\n\nWhy that double standard?","you do understand that being against illegal immigration, and gay marriage is a consistant   stance.  Both are against the laws.  Many state constitutions make sodomy illegal.  This does not make some same sex relations outlawed  but when marriage laws were made it was for a hetero sexual relationship, and not consumated until they had sex.\n\nI disagree about God's position that a person would be somehow illegal.  While He gives us free will to govern and make our own decisions but that does not entail Him agreeing what we do is a good idea.  God did for some reason disperse us and have different languages given to us.  He never how ever made us draw lines in the sand and say this is mine stay out.  \n\nSomething you might find interesting is the study of linguistics.  They have found there are over 7 core languages which would not be true if man had developed along the lines proposed by evolutionary types of progress. It is evidence that either there were over 7 iniyial groups or there was some type of Tower of Babel type incident in our past.  Certainly there maybe explanations we have not yet thought of,  but it is another one of those discoverys which back the Biblical account,  though not proof.\n\nMany of God's rules had to do with stopping diseases from spreading.  Paul it is my opinion calls attention to the prostititis desease associated with anal sex.  There are others.  So far other than using Biblical guidance we have not found a way to stop STDS.\n\nI have no Biblical direction on Illegal immigration other than to call attention to the fact that If we just limited any persons income to say 1000 times the lowest income then borders would not be a problem for labor.  Jesus did point out it is wrong to accumulate as capitalists seem to think it is their God given right to do.\n\nNo way should any person be allowed to accumulate so much wealth that the only thing left for them to buy is power.   If this were the rule (limited income) then the whole immegration problem as well as many other problems would disappear.  Therefor God has expressed a directive (2 actually including no charging interest) which has to do with immigration and if it were not ignored we would not be having this problem\n\nso do what God says and decrease desease and increase fair distribution.\n\nHe just has this knack for bringing these things back to the basics.\nwhose picture is on this coin??\ntoo tired to be coherant\nyeah Dems. boo bush"

"1","christians help me with my confusion?","why is it that people say that when Isaiah prophesied about Imanuel, that he was talking about Jesus? Mary didnt name  her baby Imanuel. She called him Yashua/Jesus.\n\nIs it possible that the prophesy refers to someone else!\n\nAlso the hebrew word from which ""virgin"" is derived in Isaiah is actualy a mistranslation(intentional?) from the word that means ""young woman""?","Immanuel, ""God is with us."" The simple fact is that it is quite common in the Bible for human beings to be given names that have the purpose of declaring or reflecting a particular attribute of God, e.g., Eliab, Eliada, Elzaphan, Eliakim, Elisha, Eleazar, Tavel, Gedaliah.\n\nIn Isaiah 7:14 the Hebrew states ""hinei ha'almah harah veyoledet ben"" ""behold (hineih) the young woman (ha - the almah- young woman) is pregnant (harah) and shall give birth (ve-and yoledet-shall give birth) to a son (ben)"". The Christians translate this as ""behold a virgin shall give birth."" They have made two mistakes (probably deliberate) in the one verse. They mistranslate ""ha"" as ""a"" instead of ""the"". They mistranslate ""almah"" as ""virgin"", when in fact the Hebrew word for virgin is ""betulah"". Aside from the fact that if you read the context of that prediction you will see clearly that it is predicting an event that was supposed to happen and be seen by king Achaz who lived 700 years before Jesus!"

"1","Can the Trinity be rationally and logically explained ?","Some might say that explaining such things is beyond our knowledge ! and therefore we can't understand it ! They only say: We believe in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost !!! A And all 3=1= God.But I say that God has given me a tool- thinking - to ration and balance things logically. \n\nAnd rationally and logically 3 is not equal to 1, and that will lead me that christians worship 3 gods not one !! \n\nSomone said that we could explain this belief by giving the example of Water and its three states ( Ice, Liquid, Steam) that they are all water !! But this explaination is not valid ! Why ? \n\nBecause we are still left with three states not one, and when they are three with different characteristics, they are still not one !! \n\nI want a rational and logical proof that 3=1 !!!","By saying the trinity, you are saying,""There are 3 distinct persons united in one God."" They are not just names of the same God.They can co-exist at the same time and yet they are one. Taking this definition, It is actually not a mystery. The key to unsolving this mystery is understanding ""one"". The one is not the numerical number one. Below are the 2 definitions of one.\n\nA) Yachead – Absolute unity; the numerical number one\n– Abraham offered up his only (Yachead) son (Genesis 22:2,12)\n– They shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only (Yachead) son (Zechariah 12:10)\n\nB) Echad – A collective unity; more than one person, one crowd, one nation etc.\n–People gathered together as one (Echad) (Ezra 3:1)\n–The Lord or God is one (Echad) God (Deuteronomy 6:4)\n–In that day, there shall be one (Echad) Lord and His Name one (Echad) (Zechariah 14:9)\n\nFor example there is one nation, but in it there is many distinct different persons. So likewise God is one(echad) God.\n\nExample 2: There is one Sun to rule the earth,The sun manifests in threefold power,Light, fire and heat. They can co_exist at the same time. \n\nNow for the sake of study, Christians have seperated the father, the son and the holy spirit, to be able to learn about each individual in a more comprehensive manner.\n\nBut the truth is they are always together and they are inseperable.\n\nso all these to say that \na) God is one in operation but 3 in revelation\nb) The three are distinguishable but indivisible\n\nHope this helps"

In regard to this it would make sense that the actual execution stake had the shape of a cross.\nChristians have made the cross into something it was never meant to be.

"1","What was the common unit of currency in the Old Testament?","","The Hebrews probably first used coins in the Persian period (500-350 B.C.). However, minting began around 700 B.C. in other nations. Prior to this precious metals were weighed, not counted as money.\n\nSome units appear as both measures of money and measures of weights. This comes from naming the coins after their weight. For example, the shekel was a weight long before it became a coin.\n\nIt is helpful to relate biblical monies to current values. But we cannot make exact equivalents. The fluctuating value of money's purchasing power is difficult to determine in our own day. It is even harder to evaluate currencies used two- to three thousand years ago.  Have a look at the chart on the website pasted below."

"1","Are we evolving passed the need for religion?","Religion has evolved throughout history...   It has become more complicated or un-complicated (depending on your view) as time has moved on.  Religion explains the unexplainable to us.  So, if we can understand things now that we couldn't understand before will we eventually not have a need for religion?  Is it possible that these belief systems are now failing?  If so, do you think we should replace it with another, or leave organization out of belief?","I'm not sure that you're correct that we actually understand more now than we did before.  It is still a common assumption that we only use 10% of our brains.  What would we know if we were able to use the other 90%?  We still have no idea what really exists outside of our immediate environment, however far that goes into space, we can only assume that we've only scratched the surface.  Despite all the things that we can create, we cannot get close to re-creating a telescopic lens as diverse as the human eye, nor can we create a shock absorbing device nearly as complex as the knee.  Yes, we are making incredible progress in certain areas, but we will never know everything.  Secondly, my relationship with Christ is not a result of me wanting to understand the world in which I live.  It is a result of a desire to be with the one who created me.  So, to answer your question, some religions may fail, they will be proven useless.  However, a relationship with Christ will never be unnecessary."

Was the cross Jesus was crucified on made of dogwood?""\n\nThe Bible does not tell us what type of wood the cross Jesus was crucified on was made of. Roman history does not go into specifics as to how the crosses were made or what type of wood they were made of. As a result, we cannot know for sure what type of tree was used to make the cross. There is a legend that it was made of dogwood. This is unlikely considering the typical size of a dogwood tree. The legend of the dogwood tree, author unknown, is as follows:\n\nIn Jesus' time, the dogwood grew\nTo a stately size and a lovely hue.\n\n'Twas strong & firm it's branches interwoven\nFor the cross of Christ its timbers were chosen.\n\nSeeing the distress at this use of their wood\nChrist made a promise which still holds good:\n\n""Never again shall the dogwood grow\nLarge enough to be used so\n\nSlender & twisted, it shall be\nWith blossoms like the cross for all to see.\n\nAs blood stains the petals marked in brown\nThe blossom's center wears a thorny crown.\n\nAll who see it will remember me\nCrucified on a cross from the dogwood tree.\n\nCherished and protected this tree shall be\nA reminder to all of my agony.""\n\nAgain, this is just a ""legend."" It is a nice poem, but there is no Biblical basis to it. The legend of the dogwood tree is very likely not accurate.\n\nthank you,"

"1","When did Amish religion originate? Where?","When and where did the Amish group originate? What are some disadvantages of being Amish?","Like the Mennonites, the Amish are descendants of the Swiss Anabaptists (1525). The Swiss Anabaptists, called the ""Swiss Brethren"", had their origins with Felix Manz and Conrad Grebel. The name ""Mennonite"" was applied later and came from Menno Simons (circa 1496–1561), who was an Anabaptist leader in the Rhein Lowlands. Simons was a Dutch Roman Catholic priest who converted to Anabaptism in 1536 and was baptized by Obbe Philips after renouncing his Catholic faith and office. He was a leader in the Lowland Anabaptist communities, but his influence reached gradually into Switzerland.\n\nThe Amish movement takes its name from that of Jacob Amman (c. 1656 – c. 1730), a Swiss Mennonite. Amman felt that the Mennonites were drifting from close adherence to the teachings of Simons and the 1632 Mennonite Dordrecht Confession of Faith. Much of the laxity was in the area of shunning excluded members, also called the ban (or Meidung in Pennsylvania German). However, the Swiss Mennonites never did practice strict shunning as the Lowland Anabaptists did. The ban meant that believers would terminate contact with a non-conforming member of the Mennonite society. Amman insisted upon this practice, even to the point of a spouse's refusing to sleep or eat with the banned member until he/she repented of his/her behavior.\n\nThis strict literalism brought about a division of the Swiss Mennonites, who, because of unwelcoming conditions in Switzerland, were scattered throughout Alsace to the Palatinate. This division occurred in 1693, and led to the establishment of the Amish. Because the Amish are the result of a division with the Mennonites, some consider the Amish a conservative Mennonite group—and, indeed, some Amish would not disagree with this title. Some Amish began to migrate to the United States in the 18th century. Many would eventually settle in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania; the first immigrants actually went to Berks County, but later moved, motivated partly by security issues, tied to the French and Indian War, and land issues. Other groups settled in or spread to Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Maryland, Tennesee, Wisconsin, Maine, and Canada."
"1","How can I make skateboarders go away?","I live in a condo complex and a bunch of kids have recently discovered that the parking lot, rails, steps and walls near my property are good for skateboarding.

What I want to do is beat them as hard as I possibly can, but they're not worth going to jail for yet.\n\nI was a kid once and have been in the situation where we asked to move, but we always did.

Christians WILL go through the ""Tribulation"" - I think it has already begun, to be honest.\n\nThe idea of a ""pre-Tribulation Rapture"" was unheard of in the writings of the Apostolic Fathers - heck - many of them thought the Diocletian Persecutions and the the persecution of Nero Caesar were pretty much a ""tribulation"", no?\n\nYou don't see that idea until the 1800's - and now, it's being perpetrated by fictional books like those ""Left Behind"" novels.\n\nNonsense."

"1","How do we know that Jesus was resurrected from the dead?","","There is, of course, no conclusive, CSI-type evidence that proves Christ's resurrection.  But consider the following:\n\nThose who felt threatened by Christ's resurrection (Jewish leadership, Roman authorities) were unable to produce a body to disprove the resurrection of Christ.\n\nThe fact that women are the first to find the empty tomb actually lends some credibility to the story.  A concocted story from first-century Judaea would not have placed women (who were not considererd reliable witnesses and who did not even have the right to testify in court) in such a prominent position in the story, because it would have made the story less believeable among contemporaries.\n\nMany people who knew Christ during his lifetime and who had witnessed his death sure didn't act like their rabbi was dead and gone.  On the contrary, Jesus's disciples behaved as though they KNEW that he was not dead - they risked their lives preaching the Good News.  Why would they all have done that if they knew it was a lie?  What's the point of dying for something you know to be untrue?\n\nDoes any of this prove that Jesus was resurrected?  No - and that proof will never be available.  The resurrection was, is, and always will be a matter of faith.  These are just a few thoughts to consider as you make your reasoned faith-judgment."

We can't know something God doesn't want us to know.  God is omnipotent (all powerful).  You can't out think God.

We initially agreed that neither one of us had any problem sharing space to look through the items, but when I left and came back later, the old guy started shouting ""Hey, why don't you take that box of stuff over to the table over there, and get out of my way""?  How typical, I thought.","I think it is not only elderly that have this sense of impatience...I think it is American culture in general.

"1","question to parents teaching religous practice to their children..?","though i am not religious, i have studied (and continue to study) religion very in-depth.  i have to say that the thing that ""irks"" me the most about religion is the belief of absolute truth that people have about their particular religion, that they pass on to their children.  i was curious if any of you out there could reassure me or share how you teach your own children about your religion?  do you make it clear to them that there are other people out there with different beliefs, and teach them about those beliefs too?  personally, the existance of religions other than catholocism was never even mentioned to me when i was younger..  i just need to know that there are people out there that are sharing the big picture with their kids.","I don't have children yet, but I plan to.  And when I do, I plan on teaching them the fundamentals (at the very least) of all major faith's (and some not so major).  Because I don't think there's merely ""one"" true path to the Divine, I will encourage them to seek out and choose their own way.\n\nI feel it's absolutely essential to encouraging tolerance and understanding among their peers.  I think it's good for them to understand what makes people think differently, and what our similarities are.  As they grow into adults and enter the work force, they will be that much more prepared to handle the dynamics of a multi-cultural environment."
"1","Could it just be the faith?","Whats the one thing most major religions have in the common? The Bible. Each religion has applied it diffrently, but they all use it.

"1","Can any Christian explain this to me with actual evidence?","Why is the meteor impact off the Yuccitan Penninsula and also off the coast of Austraila NOT in the bible if the bible records the birth of the earth and its historical beginnings?","no.  you're going to get a variety of responses ranging from the reasonable, like david's to the utterly ridiculous, like a lot of the others already here.\n\nas for the claims that the crater in the yucatan is supposition or ""only a theory"" (ever heard these words before?) there is a lot of evidence for it:\n\n""Probably the most convincing evidence for a worldwide catastrophe was the discovery of the crater which has since been named Chicxulub Crater. This so-called smoking gun is centered on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and was discovered by Tony Camargo and Glen Pentfield while working as geophysicists for the Mexican oil company PEMEX. What they reported as a circular feature later turned out to be a crater estimated to be 180 kilometers in diameter. Other researchers would later find that the end-Cretaceous extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs had lasted for thousands of years instead of millions of years as had previously been thought. This would be the final piece of evidence that convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extra-terrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change (which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period).""\n\nIt seems to be a bit more than a layer of clay in the ground.\n\nwhether this is worthy enough for biblical mention is debatable, but it seems that such a large impact would have had tremendous effects on any living species at the time, including (as creationists claim) humans.  why is there no mention of it either in the bible or other human cultures?  probably because it happened long before any humans were around.  it would have been a very important event, more important than a lot of the mentioned events in the bible.\n\nand if it is mentioned in the bible, please provide a passage."

"1","If you speak more than a Language, what controls whom to speak to in a specific language?","most of us speaks more than a language. So what part of the brain decides the language to be spoken with with certin people?","Languages are learnt by absorbing it's dialects by the subconcious mind. When you learn a language when you are grown up it is harder to learn it. The same language would have been learnt easily had it been learnt in childhood. For example , if you begin to learn chinese it is extremely difficult when you are grown up as your concious mind interferes with the learning process but have you noticed that the chinese children have mastered it since their early years? The same Logic holds true for all languages.\n\nNow coming to the central point of using a language. This is governed by your mood & your requirement of Communicating. The best of the best speakers communicating in many languages  ALWAYS curse , use unusable words in THEIR MOTHER TONGUE. But when it comes to meeting their needs they revert to what will benefit them the most. For example ,according to your moods, governed by the subconcious partly residing in the Right brain you will pass comments on a woman/man you have a crush on, in a language she/he won't understand in a Public place. So you can see that the usage of language is governed by your mind especially the subconcious."

"1","Why do people ........?","why do people hate christians????? explain? what do people have against them?","Most people hate christians, becuase that they think that Christians are trying to convert them into something that they don't want to be. When in reality God is calling them to a relationship with Him. They are taking their frustrations with God out on the person that is happy being in a relationship with Him. Not out fault your mad at God! \n\nAlso, you have to remember that God said that the church would be persecuted because of Him. We are called to be strong through it all and and keep pressing toward the mark! \n\nNon-beleivers have to remember that every person that claims to be a christian is not one. Just because Bush says he's Christians doesnt' mean that he speaks for all Christians, just because Bobby Joe from around the corner claimed to be a christians and you caught him doing something contrary to Christians beleifs doesn't mean that he speaks for me. That's the biggest problem, they hate people judging them when the person judging is doing the same thing they are doing. The reality, however, is that God is judging and that is all that matters!"

But then I decided to finally just put all the reasons aside and I sat down with open mind and heart and read the Book of Mormon and then prayed about it like it asks the reader to at the end, and you will receive an answer if its true or not. There isn't going to being any fireworks but a spirtual sense of connection.  Do you think that the gospel being one of its main principles is faith would have proof to validate itself, of course not because that would eliminate the need for faith.  I got my validation from  my prayer after I read it rather then trying to criticize it and go by known ""facts"".","I was married to a mormon once, and her daddy was a bishop.  For her sake I tried to validate mormonism, but Joseph Smith was a lying con artist who victimized the weak and ignorant.

Would this make you love God more or less?  \n\nPlease justify your answer.","Yes, I would still love God. I like him, and I like spending time with him just learning and growing. I love him because I want to, not because I'm afraid of hell.\n\nI think that your question goes a little deeper than just that though. Something to think about: if I do something wrong, like steal, I have to be punished, maybe even sent to prison. If I wasn't, then justice would not be served and I would get away with it. Now I'm just one person. What if we let the whole world get away with stealing? We would have total chaos. We punish our criminals because we believe in justice. \n\nGod can't let us get away with out sin either. If he did, the world would be totally chaotic. If he didn't punish us for the things that we did wrong, then he would no longer be just. \n\nSo if God is just, then how is it possible that we can go to heaven? Jesus (God's Son), lived on the earth and never sinned. He died on the cross to take our place and received the punishment that we deserve. And since he conquered sin (he never sinned), he rose from the dead on the third day, conquering death as well. SO, if we as individuals accept Jesus, allowing him to take the punishment instead of us, then we get to have a relationship with God, and spend eternity praising him and enjoying him forever.  \n\nIf we weren't punished for our sins, then God would not be just. Being just is an important part of who he is. In fact, if he were not just, he would be completely different, and so would our world. (Just picture living in a world with no punishment for crimes)."

Zen is a form of Mahayana Buddhism. The Name Zen is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese Character Ch'an which was the name given to the Dhyana teachings of Buddhism. \n\nA few of the more distinctive teachings of Zen(Ch'an) are:\n- Zen puts a great deal of emphases on meditation. This includes traditional sitting meditation, walking meditation and meditation while performing daily tasks such as eating, working, etc...\n- Zen puts little emphases on textual studies. Zen practitioners do read the sutras, but unlike many other forms of Buddhism, the sutras are not considered the paramount in the achievement of enlightenment. \n- Some forms of Buddhism, such as most schools of Tibetan Buddhism as well as Pure Land schools of Buddhism have many ceremonies, and rituals. Zen has many fewer and less 'secretive' practices.  \n- The Use of the Koan.  Most other schools of Buddhism believe that Enlightenment comes from a deep understanding of the doctrines of Buddhism. Zen teaches the enlightenment is a spontaneous response that is NOT perpetuated by classical study and knowledge... It just happens. A koan is a question, statement or story that generally contains aspects that are inaccessible to rational understanding, yet may be accessible to intuition and thus lead to enlightenment. \n- Generally speaking, Zen puts less emphases on Buddha the man and more on Buddha's teachings. \n\nI hope this helps."

Thanks.","Some of these questions would take a while to answer but I will try to keep this as simple and short as I can,\n\nWho are Judaism's religious leaders?  Most religious Jews study the writtings of their Sages and Rabbis that have lived throughout the ages.  A Rabbi is basically someone who  teaches Jews about Judaism.  Anciently, there was a court called the Sanhedrin that interpreted the laws and how to live by them.\n\nWhat does Judaism think about the worship or use of idols and images?  Strictly forbidden to worship or have images of God.\n\nWhat would their house of worship be?  Anciently it was the Beit Hamikdash (Temple) in Jerusalem.  Today its mostly done in a Synagogue.\n\nWhat are their beliefs about the ""Good Life"" and life after death.  \nThis one would take a lifetime to answer and there really are no clear answers.

"1","What is the best way to over come your fear?","U have to deal wit negitive, disappointment, and rejection. how do u look over that?","Everyone feels nervous or afraid at one time or another.  But, if you want to be successful and do everything you  want in life, you’ll need to overcome occasional attacks of fear. Eleanor Roosevelt once said: “You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing which you think you cannot do.”  It may make you feel uncertain to even think of attempting to do things that scare you, but isn’t it even more frightening to miss out on your dreams and aspirations? \n\nHave you ever done something that initially scared you, but then in retrospect you realized that it was not as scary as you originally thought? Your imagination had actually taken your fear and magnified it in your mind. Remember, your imagination is incredibly powerful. \n\nBefore you can eliminate fear from your life, you’ll need to identify exactly what it is that you fear. Start by forming a written list of things you want to do, but have avoided because of fear. It doesn’t matter if you have a few or a lot of items on your list, it is up to you to name them and begin to delete them – one fear at a time. Then, for each of your fears ask yourself the following questions. Each answer will help you understand more about your fears and move you closer to overcoming them.\n\n1. What is it that is making me afraid?\n\n2. Is this a fear I want to overcome and delete from my life?\n\n3. Am I allowing this fear to keep me from achieving my dreams?\n\n4. If I did the thing that I fear what would happen to me physically?\n\n5. What would happen to me mentally?\n\n6. Would the opinions of others matter to me if I did this? If so, why? \n\n7. What’s the worst thing that could happen if I did this? Could I live with this outcome?\n\n8. What’s the best thing that could happen if I did  this? Would this outcome make me happier than I am right now?\n\n9. If I never overcome this fear would I feel regret later in life?"

Well, I am sorry, but they come no where as close to doing that as the people who are roiting in violence do.\n\nIf you do not want the world to think of Muslims as terrorists, then you need to stand up and denounce the actions of those who ARE acting in a terroristic way. Burning down embassies over a religious insult IS behaving in a terroristic manner."

"1","A simple question about GOD?","IF GOD IT'S THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF EVERYTHING. THE CREATOR!\nCAN GOD CREATES A PLANET SO BIG THAT NO EVEN GOD COULD CARRY IT?","Read this and substitute mountain, stone, rock whatever with planet.\n\nI am glad that I save these long answers. . . I would hate to type it in again (for the 6th time)\n\nGod and Omnipotence\nThe paradox of the stone, as presented by Wade Savage:\n1. Either God can create a stone that God cannot lift, or God cannot create a stone that God cannot lift – there are no other possibilities. \n2. If God can create a stone that God cannot lift, then there is at least one thing that God cannot do (i.e., lift that stone). \n3. If God cannot create a stone that God cannot lift, then there is at least one thing that God cannot do (i.e., create that stone). \n4. From the combination of 1, 2 and 3, it follows that there is at least one thing that God cannot do. \n5. If God is omnipotent, then God can do anything. \n6. Therefore, God is not omnipotent. \n\nWhat this argument apparently shows is that omnipotence is impossible (or, that the notion of omnipotence is incoherent). Thus, God cannot be omnipotent (as nothing can be).\n\nSuggested solutions to the paradox St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274):\nAquinas defines as “absolutely impossible” any thing where the “predicate is altogether incompatible with the subject” (his example: “man is an ***” (in the non-metaphorical sense)). With this in mind:\nWhatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it is more appropriate to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do them.\n\nThat is, to be omnipotent involves being able to do all things that are possible. For example, it is not considered a limit to my powers that I cannot draw a square circle. That’s impossible, so it’s no failing that I can’t do it – it cannot be done.\n\nBUT: surely I can make a thing that is too heavy for me to lift, so that task is not impossible, so if God can’t do it, that really is a limit to his power.\n\nGeorge Mavrodes (1926-):\nMavrodes responds that although “a stone too heavy for Simon Cushing to lift” is not a contradictory notion, “a stone too heavy for an omnipotent being to lift” is a contradictory notion.\nMavrodes’s argument in full:\n1. Either God is omnipotent or he is not. \n2. If God is not omnipotent, then the fact that he cannot do something (either make or lift the stone) is unsurprising. \n3. If God is omnipotent, then, by definition, there necessarily cannot be a stone that is too heavy for him to lift (otherwise he would not be omnipotent). \n4. If there necessarily cannot be such a stone, then it is an impossibility. \n5. By Aquinas’s reasoning, even an omnipotent being cannot perform impossibilities. \n6. Therefore, by definition, inability to create a stone too heavy for one to lift is no barrier to being omnipotent. (In fact, only non-omnipotent beings can create objects too heavy for themselves to lift.) \n\nBUT: both Aquinas and Mavrodes assume that God cannot do impossible things. Is this right? Descartes, for one, thought not. Descartes believed God could make 2+2=5. Why? Because otherwise you are suggesting that God is bound by the laws of logic. But if God created the laws of logic, why should he be bound by them? Couldn’t he have made them differently?\n\nHarry Frankfurt:\nHowever, if we assume that God can do impossible things, then God can create a stone too heavy for him to lift (which is supposedly impossible). Furthermore, if he can do that, then he can go one stage further and lift that stone (also impossible – but what’s the difference between doing one impossible thing and doing two?) \nBUT: doesn’t that mean that the stone he created was not a stone too heavy for him to lift, and that we’re back to the situation of him being unable to create such a stone? Not according to Frankfurt:\nIf an omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible, then he can not only create situations which he cannot handle but also, since he is"

Things like it's not the things we have but more so the way we live on earth.","Not sure what your question is but maybe you were trying to find the poem you heard.  If so, here it is:\n\nHow Do You Live Your Dash\n \nI read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a friend.\nHe referred to the dates on her tombstone from the beginning... to the end. \n\nHe noted that first came her date of birth and spoke the following date with tears,\nbut he said what mattered most of all was the dash between those years. (1934-1998) \n\nFor that dash represents all the time that she spent alive on earth...\nand now only those who loved her know what that little line is worth. \n\nFor it matters not, how much we won; the cars...the house...the cash,\nwhat matters is how we live and love and how we spend our dash.\n \nSo think about this long and hard.. are there things you'd like to change?\nFor you never know how much time is left, that can still be rearranged. \n\nIf we could just slow down enough to consider what's true and real,\nand always try to understand the way other people feel.\n \nAnd be less quick to anger, and show appreciation more\nand love the people in our lives like we've never done before. \n\nIf we treat each other with respect, and more often wear a smile.\nRemembering that this special dash might only last a while.\n \nSo, when your eulogy's being read with your life's actions to rehash...\nwould you be proud of the things they said about how you spent your dash? \n\nby Linda Ellis"

"1","Why are Christians a target throughout the world?","","You've got to remember.  It's not about what we perceive as reality.  The Bible says there is a war in the ""invisbles"". . .the unseen.  It is a war against the principalities and powers of Satan.  Their objective is to supplant God.  Ålways has been.  God's objective is to redeem man, to get man back into fellowship with Him.  So, as Christians, we are in the family and Satan knows to bring whatever he has to bear against us.  Sex, war, terrorism. . .whatever.  Satan knows the Bible a whole lot better than we do and he is not afraid to jack us up royally.  He is the father of lies.  Satan's goal for us is self-destruction.  Since we choose to love God and follow Him, the only way Satan can really hurt God is to get us to choose to self-destruct.  He gets us where our weakness is and then just lets sin take it course. . .the end being self-destruction.  The world is just a part of that process.  There are really only two religions in the world.  Christianity and Hinduism.  Christianity says"" you need a God"".  Hinduism, which comes in many forms from  Mormonism to Humanism to whatever says 'you can be your own god.""  If you'll recall, that's just the same old lie Satan used in the garden and is still using today.  Hope that helps."

"1","Jesus, Bacchus, Dionysos, Osiris - your views on similarities in their worship?","I found some stuff on wikipedia about many things about the stories of Jesus and a number of rituals commonly performed by Christians. It really almost floored me to see the common thread that runs through all of them - if you don't know what i mean, look up Bacchus on wikipedia and check that out and it will have links to the others mentioned above. The one thing that I never even thought about is the implied cannibalism - eating the body, drinking the blood. I am not trying to be offensive (though I am likely succeeding in the view of some people), but it's amazing that I have never hear that addressed, nor any of the other similarities to the other 'gods'. (Don't wig about that word or capitalization, please. If He can forgive, He can forgive typos.)\n\nI know that there a lot more bona fide adults who reply to these questions, so I hope that I can get some interesting views on it. (Other than saying that it is morally out of bounds to talk about).","Many Christian customs are borrowed from idolatrous practices because they were fun and for political purposes to keep us all on the same page. Continuation of the same old story of man and thier governments. \n\n   The original sect of the Nazarene which was a sect of Judaism obeyed the first five books of the Bible which forbid the worshipping of Yahu'eh as the other nations worshipped their idols. Yahushua is Yahu'eh the Saviour. The flesh is the Son of man created by Yahueh thus the Son of Eloah/God. Eloah is a tile for Yahueh. \n\n   Satan counterfieted many of the seed of the woman issues in pagan religions to confuse this issue. The truth is though that none of the women that claimed to be virgins were but were vestel virgins secretly practicing temple prostitution in fertility worship through Nimrod, Astoroth/Easter/Istar/Semiramis/Artemis/Diana the many breasted idol ect... to numerous in names to mention. \n\n  Then after Yahu'shua the Messiah of Nazareth came about 2-300 years culminating in the reforms of Constantine the Great, a Mithra Sun Worshipper supposedly converted to Christianity, all the traditions and custom of this sun male, and moon female, fertility worship of images entered in and nearly wiped out true Messianic or Christian beliefs. This is the great falling away and grevious wolves the original 13 apostles warned us about in many places in the New Testament some even telling us this was already starting in it's infancy in their day.Jude 4, 1John, Paul's writings etc...\n\n  Why? So if you want to be decieved and ultimately worship&#92;bow down to idols which are demons with thier leader Haylel ha Satan or the Adversary then your true intention of your heart willbe revealed to all so that when you are not allowed into the kingdom of Yahueh our God it will be just and apparent to all. Yahushua of Nazareth told parables so that those that would not see & would not be in his kingdom which is a paraphrase of verses written to this effect in the New Testament quoting Yahushua."

They are portrayed as having once lived on earth before eventually ceding their direct rule to a line of human kings.\nTexts like the Am Duat ""That Which is in the Underworld"" from the New Kingdom, which are part of a larger tradition of religious texts like the Book of the Dead tell of the gods holding court in the underworld.\nHowever, Egyptian temples were also perceived by the Egyptians as houses for the various deities.  Statues were kept in the temples, they were bathed, dressed, had makeup applied to them and were ""fed"" daily by the priests and taken out on ""visits"" to other deities or to be paraded during various festivals.\nStatues in a broad sense in ancient Egypt were thought to be able to hold the soul or part of the soul of people and gods in order to receive offerings or to interact in some way with the living world.\nThere also seems to have been a belief that statues of various deities had healing powers as there are accounts of Egyptian deity statues being sent to other Near Eastern kings when those kings fell ill."

"1","Matthew 23:9 - ""Call no man Father""?","I posed a question recently about why Catholics call the Pope ""Holy Father"", and received one reply quoting the Bible and saying, ""In the bible it says ""call no man Father"" Are we to take this literally? Are Catholics wrong to call their priests ""Father""?","On occasion, you will encounter one of our separated brethren who will criticize Catholics because we call our priests ""father"", citing the verse above ""And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your father, who is in heaven."" (Mt 23:9 KJV) If one takes this passage literally, this might seem to be a fair criticism.\n\nWhat does this individual call their male parent? Daddy? Papa (which, incidentally, is Italian for Pope)? When they fill out a credit application, what do they put in the block which asks for their father's name - God? Obviously, there is meaning of this scriptural passage other than the literal one. This meaning is that there is only one Creator, from whom all ""fatherhood"" comes (Eph 3:14-15). This does not preclude addressing someone as ""father"", so long as you understand that all fatherhood (both biological and spiritual) originates with God the Father. We are all member's of God's family, a fact we acknowledge every time we recite the 'Our Father' or the Creed.\n\nSt. Paul calls himself a ""father"" in 1 Thessalonians 2:11 ""As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one you, as a father does his children."" (KJV) and again in 1 Corinthians 4:15 ""For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel."" (KJV). In both of these passages, St. Paul considers himself a spiritual father just as the priest is today. This same interpretation is presented by St. John in 1 Jn 2:13-14 where he says twice ""I write unto you, fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning."" (KJV).\n\nFinally, you might ask this individual if he or she is familiar with the New International Version (NIV) of the Bible (a common modern Protestant translation). If so, refer him or her to Matthew 23:10, the passage immediately after the one quoted to you: ""Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Messiah"". Even they have Sunday School teachers."

"1","Why is accpetable for Black's to slander White's, but not the other way round?","This happens mainly by rappers etc. who can refer to White's as ""crackers"", ""milk bottles"", ""white boys"" etc. But when a white person refers to a black person using slang they are looked down upon and called racist? Especially when black people seem use these phrases between themselves.","Jeff A, take off your pointed hood and open your eyes.\nLet's look at it from a bigger picture and ask ourselves a couple of questions.\nWhat percentage of the Global population living under the poverty line is black, asian, colored?\nNo matter how you look at it, there is a corelation between the color of skin and prevalence of poverty.\nNow, slavery and colonialism have various debilitating effects. These effects take a lot of time to heal. Every civilization in the past has at one time or the other had slaves from other conquered cultures e.g Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Nevetheless, in none of these cases has the proportion of slaves to citizens come close to the prevalence of the United States. At the height of slavery in the US, there was 1 african slave for every 4 citizen.\nIn the case of previous civilizations, the negative effects of slavery have been greatly healed by the passage of time. It has been barely a century since slavery was abolished in the US, and just a copule of decades since civil right reforms were implemented in the south. It is over optimistic, to the point of naivette, to assume that societal and racial relations in the US would be normalized after only a copule of decades.\nThis brings to mind a skit in an episode of ""Family Guy"" where a colonial white man removes the shackles from his african slave and says ""Okay, its over now. We're cool, right?"".\nIt is understandable that minorities unconsciously feel slighted about the past and wish to strike back. In roman history, an army of escaped and former slaves led the Thracean Spartacus led a bloody revolt against the Roman populace.\nIn modern US society, It is sometimes taken as a subconscious mental victory that it is politically incorrect for a white person to say ""Ni99er"" while black people can refer to each other that way. These irrelevant mental victories help to heal racial problems in the society.\nBeing born and raised for the first 20 years of my life in a West African country, I have the advantage of being able to look at the US society from an outsiders perspective.\nFor anyone who says that the current US society is racially fair, I ask them to research the average family income for a black, hispanic, asian then caucasian family. Numbers dont lie, but ultimately, time heals all wounds (hopefully)."

"1","Don't Fundamental Christians have essentially the same relationship with God as Muslims?","I recently asked a question inquiring on the differences between the relationships of Christians, Muslims and Jews have with God.  Many people answered that Christians can have a personal relationship with God.  While a Muslim answered that Muslims are slaves to their mighty god.  Don't many fundalmental christians have more of a muslim attitude towards God?  Isn't it ironic how Fundalmental Christians act towards Muslims when they really think the same way?  Are my lofty assumption true or false?","Is it true Muslims consider they can not have personal relation with God ?\n\nMuslims believe all the prayers are to be directed only to God without any middle men like saints, prophets or any one else. Is that more personal than a person thinking God can be approached only through a middle man ? \n\n ""And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very near; I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right way. "" Quran 2:186.  \n\n ""And certainly We created man, and We know what his mind suggests to him, and We are nearer to him than his life-vein. "" Quran 50: 16.  \n\nMuslims consider their each 5 times prayer as a munajath, that is, a personal conversation with God.\n\nThe word servant can seen used for believer and unbelievers equally in Quran in the sense, even a non-believer is subject to God given natural rules and limitations"

"1","Do you think that racial discrimination exists?","Socially or at the work place? How widespread do you think it is and who gets discriminated against?","Racial discrimination exists and both socially and at workplace... \nThe following  is an episode featured on oprah's show that i myself had watched..\nDaniel, a barber from London, is one of few black men who actually knows what it's like to be white. Daniel conducted a radical race experiment. Through prostetics and makeup, he posed as a white man for three months.\n\n""I was invisible all of a sudden,"" Daniel says. ""I walked down the streets of London, and people didn't watch what I was doing, where I was in location to them, where I was in location to their pocketbook or their car. The other difference I found is when I go to shops, that's when they did look at you. They put the change in your hand rather than slam it on the counter and look to the next person. There's a difference in interaction.""\n\nAnother lesson Daniel learned was not to completely hold stock in his prejudices. In disguise as a white man, Daniel went to the dog races and chatted with a kind spectator. The man was someone whom normally Daniel would have judged to be a threat for a black man. When Daniel returned later as himself, the man treated him equally as kind.\n\n""It made me question myself,"" Daniel says. ""I have to look about how I look at other people and how I judge a whole race or a whole group of people, and if I don't want them to do that to me, then I can't do that to them. It made me look the other way."""
"1","is it a sin?","is it a sin for a black person and a white person to marry or be in  a intimate relationship?i was always told this growing up. however I personnally don't think so and no body has ever showed me where in the bible it would say such a thing. i WANT serious answers only... NO racial crap.... i just want proof that it is or isn't so i can show my family.","First we need to understand the concept of sin. In Christian theology sin is anything that separates us from God, other people or ourselves.  It is not, as some think, a list of thou shall nots.  One person's sin may not be another's, up to a point of course. The basis of the Law of Moses is the 10 commandments. And Jesus taught us that there are 2 things that we must do.  We are to love God, and love our neighbor. \n\nThere are some problem with mixed marriages from a  sociological POV. This is true for race, religion, social class, and culture.  It is easier to live with someone that is more like us and raised with the same social expectations and so on. Marriage is not easy, especially as children come along and you have different ideas of how they should be raised.  The more two people are able to agree on family customs the easier it is to live a happy married life."

People write prayers and wishes and leave the note in between the stones, as it is believed that they will come true.\nWhen Israel was in Arab hands the Western Wall was turned into a garbage dump, but when Israel took back Jerusalem in 1967, the wall was cleaned up, and access to it was allowed to everyone."

OR okay, she can be scared that her g/f will try and kill herself (again). Bottom line, that girl is controling your friends life and its a very bad situation. Tell your friend to seek professional advice on how to get out of that relationship. She is being emotionally abused and needs to get out ASAP. Tell your girlfriend to call a hotline, get advice on how to leave and then just be there for her during the transition and so forth. IF your friend refuses to try harder and at least another month goes by then yes, move on. It may be very hard but at this rate its not fair to you. Good luck!"

"1","Why do NY called Big Apple ?","","I never really asked myself why New York City is also called ""The Big Apple"". Today I found the answer... At least a possible one.\n\nI went to Harlem and walked around for a couple of hours. I happend to come across the ""Uptown Saterday Nite"" Festival which is part of the 2005 Harlem Week. Nothing sensational but on the corner of 135th Street and 7th Avenue I noticed this old red building with a sign showing an upside down apple saying ""The Big Apple"". I took a photograph and went on.\nAfter coming home I did a little research on the internet, looking for this particular sign in Harlem. That's how I found out about the history of this sign and New Yorks nickname.\n\nIn the 1920's Jazz musicians picked the term ""Big Apple"" up from horseracing people who considered New York races and gigs to be where the big money was. Since a horse, up for a big purse in New York City, can't get paid off in big money himself, the lingo promised him a big apple. At this time a night club opened in Harlem called ""The Big Apple"". Some historians think that New Yorks nickname may have come from this long forgotten club. The club is gone, the sign, with its upside down apple, is still there.\n\nFor another theory you may want to read this article from the Society for New York City History."

"1","Can someone give me examples and the meaning of the indicative and subjunctive mood?","Is conditional, and imperfect moods too? If so, what do they mean?","The subjunctive mood is used to talk about imaginary or unreal situations or a desire like ""If I were an animal I would be a dog""...you're obviously not an animal and never will be...and you're right it is often used in conditional sentences...another case of subjunctive is when it's used with wish like ""I wish I were a millionaire"" or ""I wish I had lots of money""...In English you use the past tense to form the subjunctive and if you need to use the verb to be, use ""were"" with all pronouns (I were, he were, she were, we were, etc) although when speaking many people say ""If I was""...\n\nThe conditional mood is the one that expresses lack of certainty and it occurs especially but no only in conditional sentences.  There are five types of conditional\n\nthe zero conditional expresses a situations that's always true or often happen, for example ""If I have a headache I take an aspirin""\n\nthe first conditional expresses a situation which is likely to happen in the future, for example, ""If it rains this afternoon I won't go out""\n\nthe second conditional is about a situation which is unreal or unlikely to happen, like ""If I became the president of the US, I would abolish taxes""\n\nthe third conditional talks about a past situation which has already happened and therefore it's impossible to change, like ""If I had gone to the party yesterday I would have had lots of fun""\n\nthe mixed conditional is similar to the third only that the consequence of the action is still visible in the present like, ""If penicillin hadn't been discovered, many people would die from infections""\n\nThe indicative mood is the one we use to establish a fact or something that is true like ""The Earth is round"". ""I am a student"", ""I went to a party yesterday""...It's the most commonly used mood and there is an indicative form for present, past and future\n\nThere is no such thing as the imperfect mood...the imperfect is a verb tense, although it is not called so in English...the English equivalents to other languages' imperfect tense are for example I was eating or I used to eat, that is, the past progressive, etc...in English only the subjunctive has an imperfect form which is the one I explained to you before (I were, she were, etc) as oppossed to the present subjunctive which is not very common and can be seen in sentences like ""She requests that he come to the meeting tomorrow""...as you can see the -s is not used with the third person in this case...\n\nok I hope I was clear enough, please let me know if you still have any doubts!"

Since this seems to be more about general communication than actual speeches, its a lot less formal most of the time. If you are worried that people will make fun of you, try to stay current with whatever is going on in the group your involved in. If you are in a group of people who like movies, you know that if you havent looked up movies in a while you might be a bit out of place. Theres no real set science to being able to talk in groups. It really does help to be comfortable with your views and opinons. People usually want to hear other peoples opinions. A lot of times people feel nervous talking in groups but if you start getting involved you find that people will be affirming and it gets a little easier. Im not saying you have to be the life of the party right away. If someone says something you agree with, say that you feel the same way. Take baby steps. Soon you might feel a little more comfortable as people are a little more positive. Just keep working at it, and dont get frusterated if you end up saying something a little silly at times, because we all do."

"1","Where did AIDS come from and do you think there is a cure somewhere that hasn't been exposed?","This question came from my friend insisting that AIDS is a man made disease (which I believe) and that Majic Johnson has the cure. Some person told me it came from a monkey another said from gay people (although I absolutely don't believe). What do you think?","I thought this was an amazing article. It was just published a few days ago:\n\nWASHINGTON - Twenty-five years after the first AIDS cases emerged, scientists have confirmed that the HIV virus plaguing humans really did originate in wild chimpanzees, in a corner of Cameroon.\n\nSolving the mystery of HIV’s ancestry was dirty work. Scientists employed trackers to plunge through dense jungle and collect the fresh feces of wild apes — more than 1,300 samples in all.\n\nBefore that, it took seven years of research just to develop the testing methods to genetically trace the primate version of the virus in living wild chimps without hurting the endangered species.\n\nUntil now, “no one was able to look. No one had the tools,” said Dr. Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. She led the team of international researchers that reported the success in Friday’s edition of the journal Science.\n\n“We’re 25 years into this pandemic,” Hahn said. “We don’t have a cure. We don’t have a vaccine. But we know where it came from. At least we can make a check mark on one of those.”\n\nScientists long have known that nonhuman primates carry their own version of the AIDS virus, called SIV or simian immunodeficiency virus. But with one exception, it had been found only in captive chimpanzees, particularly a subspecies that in the wild populates mostly West Africa.\n\nIt was not known how prevalent the virus was in chimps in the wild, or how genetically or geographically diverse it was, complicating efforts to pin down the jump from animal to man.\n\nHahn’s team tested chimp feces for SIV antibodies, finding them in a subspecies called Pan troglodytes troglodytes in southern Cameroon.\n\nChimps tend to form geographically distinct communities. By genetically analyzing the feces, researchers could trace individual infected chimps. The team found some chimp communities with infection rates as high as 35 percent, while others had no infection at all.\n\nEvery single infected chimp had a common base genetic pattern that indicated a common ancestor, Hahn said.\n\nThere are three types of HIV-1, the strain of the human virus responsible for most of the worldwide epidemic. Genetic analysis let Hahn identify chimp communities near Cameroon’s Sanaga River whose viral strains are most closely related to the most common of those HIV-1 subtypes.\n\n“The genetic similarity was striking,” Hahn said.\n\nThe first human known to be infected with HIV was a man from Kinshasa in the nearby country of Congo who had his blood stored in 1959 as part of a medical study, decades before scientists knew the AIDS virus existed.\n\nPresumably, someone in rural Cameroon was bitten by a chimp or was cut while butchering one and became infected with the ape virus. That person passed it to someone else.\n\nThe Sanaga River long has been a commercial waterway, for transporting hardwood, ivory and other items to more urban areas. Eventually, someone infected made it to Kinshasa.\n\n“How many different transmission events occurred between that initial hunter and this virus making it to Kinshasa, I don’t know. It could have been one, it could have been 10, it could have been 100,” Hahn said. “Eventually, it ended up in an urban area, and that’s where it really got going.”\n\nSomewhere in all that spread, the virus became more deadly to people than it is to chimps, who seldom are bothered much by SIV.\n\nThe research seems to settle any question of HIV’s origin, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health’s AIDS chief.\n\nWhen tracing a virus’ evolution, “it’s important to get as close to the source as you can,” he said. “It’s of historic interest.”"

He will break the cross, kill the pigs and become a just Judge."" \n\nSome Muslim scholars interpretation on this saying is: ""Jesus will not  break the cross one by one and also kill the pigs one by one which is quite impossible but rather it signifies that people will turn into the folds of Islam in abundance leaving their old beliefs. He will then become a worldly Judge for humans not of his own will but of the will of He who send him which is Almighty God.""\n\nHope this answers your question."

"1","anyone know how to learn how to see ghost or spirits?","","In my opinion it is impossible to teach yourself to see ghosts, you either can or you can't (and I know a couple of people who can, including myself when I was younger, the former owner of my parents house, which he build, doesn't want to leave, and he's a fairly nice old man).  \n\nI will argue that all ghost are not demonic spirits, yes, some are are really, really bad (like the one is my sister's apartment in State College, PA, he stalked my sister's roommate in certain instances, which is how I found out she can see ghosts), but for the most part there is as much a mix of good spirits to malevolent spirits as there are to good people vs. malevolent people. \nNow, you can experience ghosts with out being able to see them.  Before I go any futher I have to say, there is no scientific evidence that either confirms or denies the existence of ghosts, spirits, whatever you want to call them.  Having personal experience with instance that are within keeping of arguements made toward the existence of ghosts (yeah I know that is hard to read, but i can't phrase it much better), I happen to belive in them.  Since ghosts take space they have a subtance, while this substance is generally not visible to the average person, the electromagnatic patterns show up on pictures, including digital cameras.  So, if you think you have a ghost take a bunch of pictures, they will show up as a ball of light, where there is nothing.  However, I wouldn't recommend using a cell phone cam because the resolution of those suck, so distortion for bright lights in the background may interfere with an accurate picture.  See the source for tips to photograph them.\n\nI will agree with the statement that if even if you could learn to see them, you don't want want to.  There is nothing scarier then seeing a pure black spirits (one that is completely evil).  Yes, if you have the ability to see them, most of them are a shade of grey.  The color spectrum is  from pure white (good) to pure black (evil), most of them are a shade of grey, though I never remember seeing a pure white spirit, a couple that were a really light shades of grey, but never white.  Just in case you are wondering, it was around the age of 12-13 that I could no longer see ghosts, though I can stil ""sense"" most spirits."

Such religions are inherently predatory and destructive of the cultural systems that they encounter in their role as the aggressor.”\n\n\nChristian churches have formed terrorist organisation in non christian countries. In north east India they have been using all methods for conversion including conversions at gun point. In some states they have literally banned practising hinduism in last four years. 20 hindus were killed only in 2001 for not converting.\n\nOnce they get considerable number of converts they turn more aggressive and resort to more violent tactics, They have been trying to break india and make a separate christian nation now.

"1","Are we ALL capable of murder?","What do you think drives the most apparently 'sane' people to murder?\nWhat would drive you?\nIs it a tragic human flaw that causes us to kill each other for sport, revenge, fury, love and NOT the basic animal instincts of hunger and protection; or the belief that we are more superior than others?","Forget about the whole ""we're so much better than animals"" thing. Our animal instincts still affect us, even though it's not apparent. The ""fight and flight"" instinct is still prominent in our systems.\n\nSo when man murders outside of ""he'll kill me first"" then it's a mental thing that they are willing to do. Does that mean that we're all capable outside of that, sure. We just decide that a person's life isn't as important as ours (which is what hunters have when they hunt, no hunter things of the animal as an equal).

"1","Would you listen to them?","I honestly can't believe the things I am hearing from Jehovah's Witnesses. I've been talking to them and find them humble and eager to teach. I was raised a Catholic, have studied many different religions, but none of them compare to Jehovah's Witnesses. I have always found all religions to be hypocritical in some way, but not with the JWs (and trust me, I've been trying to find something wrong w/ them). Every single one of their teachings they back up with the scriptures- it's even kinda annoying! lol. I don't know what made me open my door up to them that day, but I did. Anyways, my question is would u listen to them? Give them a chance? If not, why not?","These facts about Jehovah's Witnesses are perhaps relevant to this question. The more one compares this Christian religion with others, the more remarkable it is shown to be.\n\n1. Jehovah's Witnesses have no paid clergy. Yet they remain tightly organized with more than 6.5 million active Jehovah's Witness preachers (about 16 million associate themselves with the religion). Even fulltime preachers and workers at their branch offices are unpaid volunteers.\n\n2. There is no elite class among Jehovah's Witnesses. Even the few 'anointed' among them enjoy no special privileges in their congregations on earth. An anointed person (one of those relative few with a heavenly hope) is not elevated above his fellow congregants in any way, and he may not even qualify for appointment as a simple 'deacon' or elder. There are no titles; EVERYONE is addressed as 'brother' or 'sister'.\n\n3. No person benefits economically from the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Even the 8 to 20 men who serve on their Governing Body receive simply room, board, medical care, and reimbursement for certain personal expenses according to the exact same provision as every other branch volunteer.\n\n4. About a hundred men have served on Jehovah's Witnesses' Governing Body committee during the past 125 years or so. The vast majority of them have spent the vast majority of their adult lives volunteering for their organization's purposes, and the vast majority have died faithfully and near-pennilessly while still under their legal 'vow of poverty'.\n\n5. Amazingly, Jehovah's Witnesses did not splinter as a sect from some other religion. Instead, a truly tiny but sincere group of bible students studied only the Scriptures to determine the will of God. Thus their religion remains absolutely independent of and not carrying the sins of Christendom's history, yet carries the authority of Christ's teachings.\n\n6. Despite the distortions of anti-Witnesses, throughout their modern history Jehovah's Witnesses have refused to claim divine inspiration or infallibility for their teachings. They have pointed to the bible (and not any particular translation) as the only inspired infallible means of knowing God's thoughts. For over 125 years, their teachings have been presented as merely the results of sincere bible research by imperfect but godly humans.\n\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/jt/article_07.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20040601/article_02.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/people/who.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/people/statistics.htm"

He wants you to believe, He wants to reveal Himself to you, He wants to make Himself real to your heart.\n\nLearn about Jesus - read Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\nLearn about the early church-  read the book of Acts\n\nObey God - maybe there is something you haven't been willing to do that He wants you to do - Trust Him, love Him, obey Him.\n\nGod bless!!"
"1","What do you all think about so many ""respectable"" members of society soliciting children for sex online?","I live in Dallas, and we recently had 2 Police officers arrested for soliciting sex from what they thought was a 14 yr old girl. I thought it was one of those rare sick things. Then they showed a band teacher on the news who did the same thing, and now we've got the Press Secretarty of homeland security doing it too? These are people who have a lot of influence within the community & government. It seems like everyone wants to molest children these days. \nA friend of mine told me they believe this is just the begining. They pointed out the fact that we also have quite a few female school teachers who have been caught haveing sex with their under aged male students. My friend said ""I wouldn't be surprized if in the future, society just gives up & lowers the legal age of sexual consent to 12 or 14. Seems shocking, but possible. \nWhat are opinions regarding this whole issue?","I don't think it is a new phenomenon. I think it just gets talked about more these days. \nIn the past people were more afraid of coming forward and reporting abuse because of social stigmas. Now people are a lot more understanding for the victim. I think this is evidenced by the huge number of cases that have come out in recent years here in Australia which date back 30 - 40 years. Grown men have finally found the courage to come forth and talk about what heppened to them without being themselves labelled as ""gay"" or ""dirty""."

"1","What's Behind 666?","","33 The wild beast has a name, and this name is a number: 666. Six, as a number, is associated with Jehovah’s enemies.  A Philistine man of the Rephaim was of “extraordinary size,” and his “fingers and toes were in sixes.” (1 Chronicles 20:6) King Nebuchadnezzar erected a golden image 6 cubits in breadth and 60 cubits high, to unify his political officials in one worship. When God’s servants refused to worship the image of gold, the king had them thrown into a fiery furnace. (Daniel 3:1-23) The number six falls short of seven, which stands for completeness from God’s standpoint. Therefore, a triple six represents gross imperfection.\n\n     34 A name identifies a person.  So how does this number identify the beast?  John says that it “is a man’s number,” not that of a spirit person, so the name helps to confirm that the wild beast is earthly, symbolizing human government. Just as six fails to measure up to seven, so 666—six to the third degree—is a fitting name for the world’s gigantic political system that fails so miserably to measure up to God’s standard of perfection. The world’s political wild beast rules supreme under the name-number 666, while big politics, big religion, and big business keep that wild beast functioning as an oppressor of mankind and a persecutor of God’s people.\n\n35 What does it mean to be marked on the forehead or in the right hand with the name of the wild beast? When Jehovah gave Israel the Law, he told them:  “You must apply these words of mine to your heart and your soul and bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they must serve as a frontlet band between your eyes.” (Deuteronomy 11:18)  This meant that the Israelites had to keep that Law constantly before them, so that it influenced all their actions and thoughts.  In imitation, Satan uses the demonic mark of the wild beast.   Anybody engaged in everyday activities such as buying and selling is pressured to do things the way the wild beast does, as, for example, in celebrating holidays.  They are expected to worship the wild beast, letting it rule their lives, so as to receive its mark.\n\n38 Yes, the world is a difficult place for those who do not have the mark of the wild beast.  It is an outstanding demonstration of Jehovah’s power and blessing that the remaining ones of the seed of the woman, as well as more than three million of the great crowd, are keeping integrity despite all the pressures to break God’s laws.  (Revelation 7:9)  Unitedly, throughout the earth, may all of us continue to magnify Jehovah and his righteous ways, as we refuse to receive the mark of the wild beast.—Psalm 34:1-3.\n\n    If you would like further information or a free home Bible study, please contact Jehovah's Witnesses at the local Kingdom Hall.

Open your eyes and explore , dont answer as a prejudist.\n\nThe creation of the universe is one of matter, space and time that are intimately linked together. Matter and space were joined as one and then were separated in the explosion. This is very accurately described in the Quran which was reveiled 1400 years back.\n\n""Do not the unbelievers see that the skies (space) and the earth (matter) were joined together (as one unit of creation) and we ripped them apart?"" The Quran, 21:30","old school, it`s one but it`s literature buddy!!!\n\nI`d like to add more\n\nScientists’ Comments on the Scientific Miracles in the Holy Quran: \nThe following are some comments of scientists1 on the scientific miracles in the Holy Quran.  All of these comments have been taken from the videotape entitled This is the Truth.  In this videotape, you can see and hear the scientists while they are giving the following comments.  (To view the RealPlayer video of a comment, click on the link at the end of that comment.  For a copy of this videotape, please visit this page.) \n \n\n1)  Dr. T. V. N. Persaud is Professor of Anatomy, Professor of Pediatrics and Child Health, and Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  There, he was the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy for 16 years.  He is well-known in his field.  He is the author or editor of 22 textbooks and has published over 181 scientific papers.  In 1991, he received the most distinguished award presented in the field of anatomy in Canada, the J.C.B. Grant Award from the Canadian Association of Anatomists.  When he was asked about the scientific miracles in the Quran which he has researched, he stated the following: \n\n“The way it was explained to me is that Muhammad was a very ordinary man.  He could not read, didn’t know [how] to write. In fact, he was an illiterate.  And we’re talking about twelve [actually about fourteen] hundred years ago.  You have someone illiterate making profound pronouncements and statements and that are amazingly accurate about scientific nature.  And I personally can’t see how this could be a mere chance.  There are too many accuracies and, like Dr. Moore, I have no difficulty in my mind that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led him to these statements.”  (View the RealPlayer video of this comment ) \n\nProfessor Persaud has included some Quranic verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  in some of his books.  He has also presented these verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  at several conferences. \n\n2)  Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson is the Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.  Formerly, he was Professor of Ob-Gyn and the Chairman of the Department of Ob-Gyn at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  He was also the President of the American Fertility Society.  He has received many awards, including the Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology Public Recognition Award in 1992.  Professor Simpson studied the following two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad : \n\n{In every one of you, all components of your creation are collected together in your mother’s womb by forty days...}2 \n\n{If forty-two nights have passed over the embryo, God sends an angel to it, who shapes it and creates its hearing, vision, skin, flesh, and bones....}3 \n\nHe studied these two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  extensively, noting that the first forty days constitute a clearly distinguishable stage of embryo-genesis.  He was particularly impressed by the absolute precision and accuracy of those sayings of the Prophet Muhammad .  Then, during one conference, he gave the following opinion: \n\n“So that the two hadeeths (the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad ) that have been noted provide us with a specific time table for the main embryological development before forty days.  Again, the point has been made, I think, repeatedly by other speakers this morning: these hadeeths could not have been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge that was available [at] the time of their writing . . . . It follows, I think, that not only there is no conflict between genetics and religion but, in fact, religion can guide science by adding revelation to some of the traditional scienti"

"1","why is it bad for to people of the same gender to get married even if they love each other ?","","It is not really a human question.  By whose standards are you living?  People will condemn you for everthing you do that is not the same as them.  If you are poor, fat, gay, stay at home mom, working mom, in private school, in public school...etc.  People are not what 'should' matter.  It is between you, and the person you get involved with.\n\nIf you beleive in God, then that is another matter and it is also completely your own business.  If you DO believe in God though....you'll have to be honest with yourself and take the matter to HIM alone in prayer.\n\nPeople need to mind their business about someone's private life - and if they are 'Chrisitians"" they cannot judge you -they can only look at themselves - and improve or make their own changes within.  \n\nLegalization would really depend on the religious influence of the country.  You cannot expect basic bible principles to change for your convenience. No need to be bitter - religion is not necessarily a bad thing, it is just not that convenient - for anybody who devoutly tries to follow it.  \n\nNot just gays. Nobody wants to feel discriminated against. It is not a good thing to have to live with. However gays have gained a lot - perhaps some feel that it has been at 'their' expense.

It's hard not to judge, but by forcing myself to see that she needs dignity and can decide if she can decline an offer of food so be it.)\n\nLet these encounters help you become a better person."

"1","Can creationists explain this?","I saw in the paper today about a program that is gonna be on TV (in the States) next month. Its about animals in the womb, they have some AMAZING pictures. I cant wait until its aired in the UK. But the article went into how it will discuss why all mammal embryo's look very similar to human embryo's in the beginning (us being a mammal and all). And why dolphin embryos actually have leg buds that eventually disappear (it is thought that dolphins evolved from a land walking creature).\nDoes this tie in with the Creation story (I mean us all starting off very similar and dolphins having legs etc) or does this offend you as the idea of evolution does so many of you?\n\nJust curious as to how those who dont believe in evolution would react to this program.\n\nHeres a link to the article, its worth looking at just for the pictures, theyre incredible!\nhttp://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006540470,00.html","OMG, thanks for that link... those pictures are just amazing!\n\nI already accept evolution, though :)"

"1","I have always been troubled by the adage ""just be yourself"". How does one freely just be? does anyone, really?","","I'm taking an Acting for Animators class where we do improv games. The point is to say the first thing in your mind. So that is the natural you, where you can be most creative; when you express yourself as your truest nature.\n\nOften in social situations we may think something and not say it because Person X is present, or they may think I'm weird, or I'm not comfortable doing/saying that in public, or whatever.\n\nAnd often we change how we respond to people based on not what they want, but our PERCEPTION of what they want. So we are faking ourselves to even us.\n\nWhat is true chemistry between people? When they are both themselves and extremely comfortable.\n\nBut changing how you act in front of different people is not a bad thing - everyone does it to different degrees. The problem is when it bothers YOU that you can't ""open up."" If that's the case, then it's better to just be yourself and not worry about what others think...obviously don't say things to offend people or be rude. But beyond that, anything goes. I am me, and the world's gonna know who I am.\n\n\nWhen you open yourself up, you'll get some people who like you, and some people that don't. But this depends less on what you actually say and do. It depends more on how you actually feel about yourself. The best bet is to be yourself AND like yourself!"

"1","Do you think the desire to have children is mainly altruistic or mainly selfish?","Or is it a physical urge that goes deeper than either one of these?","Thats a good question, but maybe too philosophical. It´s really just an urge. Perhaps, the question is: can an urge not be selfish? When you have an altruistic impulse, you´re really simply trying to satisfy yout own urge. Let me explain better: let´s say you donate money. Even if you do it privately, aren´t you really satisfying a need to feel good about yourself, or maybe, to ease a guilty conscience.\nTaking it a step further, a social biologist, would argue that, even very altruistic deeds, e.g. if you risk/ lose your life to save others (specially kids or women), it still is a very selfish act. The idea is that, since we share so many genes, there might acctually be a better chance of perpetuating your own genes (not the physical dna but the information) by sacrificing yourself and saving a child or a child factory (aka womb).\nThis also idea explains and justifies the urge to save wild animals like lions or apes (but not geckos), their genes are, in large, the same as ours own. Which come down to saying that even tree huggers are kind of selfish. \nSo chillout."
"1","ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT POSEIDOn???","What did he do? Anything special about him except for the fact that he's the sea god and horse and trident? Any myths... Also, what do you think he wore or looked like...","Poseidon\n\nPoseidon is a god of many names. He is most famous as the god of the sea. The son of Cronus and Rhea, Poseidon is one of six siblings who eventually ""divided the power of the world."" His brothers and sisters include: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Zeus. The division of the universe involved him and his brothers, Zeus and Hades. Poseidon became ruler of the sea, Zeus ruled the sky, and Hades got the underworld. The other divinities attributed to Poseidon involve the god of earthquakes and the god of horses. The symbols associated with Poseidon include: dolphins, tridents, and three-pronged fish spears. \n Poseidon was relied upon by sailors for a safe voyage on the sea. Many men drowned horses in sacrifice of his honor. He lived on the ocean floor in a palace made of coral and gems, and drove a chariot pulled by horses. However, Poseidon was a very moody divinity, and his temperament could sometimes result in violence. When he was in a good mood, Poseidon created new lands in the water and a calm sea. In contrast, when he was in a bad mood, Poseidon would strike the ground with a trident and cause unruly springs and earthquakes, ship wrecks, and drownings. \n\nPoseidon was similar to his brother Zeus in exerting his power on women and in objectifying masculinity. He had many love affairs and fathered numerous children. Poseidon once married a Nereid, Amphitrite, and produced Triton who was half-human and half-fish. He also impregnated the Gorgon Medusa to conceive Chrysaor and Pegasus, the flying horse. The rape of Aethra by Poseidon resulted in the birth of Theseus; and he turned Caeneus into a man, at her request, after raping her. Another rape involved Amymone when she tried to escape from a satyr and Poseidon saved her. Other offspring of Poseidon include: Eumolpus, the Giant Sinis, Polyphemus, Orion, King Amycus, Proteus, Agenor and Belus from Europa, Pelias, and the King of Egypt, Busiris. \n\nOne of the most notorious love affairs of Poseidon involves his sister, Demeter. Poseidon pursued Demeter and to avoid him she turned herself into a mare. In his lust for her, Poseidon transformed himself into a stallion and captured her. Their procreation resulted in a horse, Arion. Poseidon is Greek for ""Husband"" (possibly of wheat), and therefore it is thought that he and Demeter (goddess of wheat) are a good match because they reign as the god and goddess of fertility. \n\n Another infamous story of Poseidon involves the competition between him and the goddess of war, Athena, for the city of Athens. To win the people of the city over, Poseidon threw a spear at the ground and produced the Spring at the Acropolis. However, Athena won as the result of giving the people of Athens the olive tree. In his anger over the decision, Poseidon flooded the Attic Plain. Eventually, Athena and Poseidon worked together by combining their powers. Even though Poseidon was the god of horses, Athena built the first chariot. Athena also built the first ship to sail on the sea over which Poseidon ruled. \n\nPoseidon often used his powers of earthquakes, water, and horses to inflict fear and punishment on people as revenge. Though he could be difficult and assert his powers over the gods and mortals, Poseidon could be cooperative and it was he who helped the Greeks during the Trojan War. Poseidon is an essential character in the study of Greek mythology. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Busses were running full time to get people out, yet so many refused to leave.  Some were on the news dancing in the streets of the French Quarter as the storm approached.  After the storm, they all ran for the Superdome, and there were not enough supplies for the additional people, so that screwed the people who originally went to be sheltered there.  Something else angers me: The National Guard gets blamed for not responding, but the storm was over Tuesday, and TV cameras broadcast National Guard at the airport on Thursday.  This pretty enlisted female told the reporter that they arrived Wednesday, and were setting up relief.\n\nThen cops are out there looting Wal Mart (caught on video).  It would have been one thing if they were getting food, but, well you know the rest of the story.  \n\nPeople cry for the idiots in New Orleans (no, the ones who evacuated are NOT idiots), while Rita pretty much levelled some towns in Southwest Louisiana.

(II Kings 18:27)","What's with you and the obsessive coprophagia?

Nothing is found in a vacuum. Regarding that specific passage, they are the words of the Assyrian embassy to Jerusalem who came to threaten King Hezekiah. The officials of Jerusalem asked Rabshakeh not to speak in a language comprehensible to the soldiers (the men which sit on the wall), lest they become disheartened. The Rabshekah responds as you cite, essentially saying ""I have not come only to threaten you, but to humiliate you and all your people even to the point of being forced to consume their own waste.""\n\nAnd if we keep going, (NRSV translation):\n18:28-32  ""Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah, ""Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah make you rely on the Lord by saying, the Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me; then every one of you will eat from your own vine and your own tree, and drink water from your own cistern, until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey, that you may live and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying, The Lord will deliver us.""\n\nAnd so on, and so on.\n\nIf you're going to argue from the Bible, at least know a little about it.

Since my thoughts are usually long to explain, what do you all consider an adult is?","I don't think adult is a matter of age but a matter of maturity.

In the meantime girls that look just like her are walking the streets all around them.\nHer looks are nothing special.\nThe only time ""slutty"" is attractive to guys, is if it's directed towards us, and we think there's a chance (IE our girlfriends/wives acting slutty)."

Clearly your beliefs are strong to you, and it matters to you that others see things your way.  If you fee bad about blowing up at people, then try to talk slower, take deep breaths, and count to 10 when you start to feel it coming.  Sometimes you can catch more flies with honey you know."

"1","How can some chirstians tell Homo/lesbians that they are going to hell but if you murder someone you wont?","i just dont get it. it boggles the mind so someone can be  a mass murder and still go to heaven ?","Just make sure you understand that God loves the individual, however, their behavior and life choice will lead them into bondage that will harden their hearts to God's eternal salvation. Because Homosexuality involves so much emotional investment, it is almost impossible to tell the them the truth without being labeled with very harsh epithets. \n\nThe homosexual has just as much access to salvation and forgiveness that the murder or even average person. The only difference is that most murderers know that they have done something wrong, and most homosexuals see their behavior as acceptible. So who is going to gain forgiveness? One who knows they are a sinner and pleads for mercy, or one who argues with God for acceptance?"

If you ask 10 people the same question you will get 10 very different answer. If you take their answer to help you improve what is wrong, it is not a bad thing to do. I say you should look at their answer very openly. Don't think that whatever they answered are really what they think of you. You can really like someone and still not be blind to their mistakes. See if you can learn to be a better person from the answers they give you. \n\nGood luck!!!"
"1","BNP - Good or Bad?","As someone concerned about the increasing numbers of immigrants and a decline in the British way of life. Is the BNP the only party who will defend British values?  Though I feel uncomfortable with their judgement of a person by the colour of their skin.  It seems the mainstream parties are waving white flags to the Politically correct brigade who have ruined our country.  Any ideas on who to vote for next time?","The BNP 'official' standpoint isn't a ridiculous, or evil, one.\n\nMany countries adopt their core values and to the benefit of their citizens. At some point we need to curb immigration, that's a fact. \n\nThe BAD thing about voting for the BNP is that they are too stupid to govern and attract Nazi boneheaded thugs as supporters.\n\nSoon a major party will adopt the less dramatic elements of BNP policy to the benefit of us all, black and white."

Should I report it to someone?","This is from a marketing group.  They called me in regards to magazines that I receive, probably one of the ones I get for free for providing BS information about the spending habits of the company I work for.  Stay on the line for a few seconds after answering, ask them right away what this is in regards to and on behalf of what company are they calling, then immediately tell them you are tired of their harassing phone calls, that you want to be put on their ""Do Not Call"" list, and you want them to mail you a copy of their ""Co Not Call"" policy.  When I did this, the girl on the other end immediately got quiet, said 'Ok', and hung up the phone."

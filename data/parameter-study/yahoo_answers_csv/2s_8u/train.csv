"2","why are changes in inventories included as part of investment spending?","","Inventory Investment: There are three types of inventory investment: materials and supplies, work in progress, and finished goods.\n\nInventory Investment\nInventory investment relates to the composition of GDP. What is produced in a certain country is naturally also sold, but some of the goods produced in a given year may not be sold the same year, but in later years. Coherently, some of the goods sold in a given year might have been produced in an earlier year. The difference between goods produced (production) and goods sold (sales) in a given year is called inventory investment.\n\nIf firms produce more than they sell and inventories are accumulated, inventory investment is positive.\n\nIf firms sell more than they produce and inventories fall, inventory investment is negative.\n\n\nThree Important Relations\nThese three relations between production, sales and inventory investment can be helpful:\n\nInventory investment = production - sales\n\nProduction = sales + inventory investment\n\nSales = production - inventory investment"

"2","which of the following is a saturated hydrocarbon: isopropane, butene, pentyne, or benzene?","","Isopropane.\n\n""The number of hydrogen atoms associated with a given skeleton of carbon atoms may vary.  When the chain or ring carries the full complement of hydrogen atoms, the hydrocarbon is said to be ""saturated"".  Such hydrocarbons are known as paraffins, paraffinic hydrocarbons, or alkanes/cycloalkanes. The ""paraffin"" term was common in the oil industry, because of the waxy characteristics of crude which contains these molecules.  The term ""alkanes"" is common among chemists.\n\nStraight-chain  structures are ""normal paraffins"", branch-chain structures are ""isoparaffins"", and ring-type structures are ""cycloparaffins"" or naphthenes.  Thus for three hydrocarbons with five carbon atoms (i.e. all ""pentanes"") we have several structures."""
"2","How does journal bearing works?","How does journal bearing works?","A journal bearing is also called a sleeve bearing because  it consists of a sleeve that encloses a portion of the shaft. It relies on a film of oil to support the shaft and permit shaft to rotate within the sleeve. \n\nUnlike an antifriction bearing (ball or roller type) A journal bearing tends to generate a good bit of heat and needs a method to keep cool either by radiation or a circulating system using a coolant. The oil film also needs a method to maintain sufficient oil to keep the oil film from breaking down."

"2","Why you cannot give atropine to glaucoma patients ?","","Atropine effect the muscles in the eye that are responsible for contarcting and dilating the iris. When atropine is administered these muscles are temporarily paralysed and dilate. This dilation causes the the flow of liquid (aqueous humor) to be restricted thus raising the pressure within the eyeball.\nOne of the main symptoms of Glaucoma (specifically acute angle closure glaucoma) is an increase in pressure with the eye ball that causes pain and damage to the optic nerve and requires emergency treatment. Therefore any drug that will cause an increase in the pressure within the eye ball will not be administered to patients with acute angle closure glaucoma."

"2","what    are     the    inputs for engine degreaser?","","http://shop.store.yahoo.com/autopia/inf-engine.html\n\nApplying Degreaser\nAfter warming the engine and protecting sensitive areas, you're ready to apply your engine degreaser.  Although they are quick and easy, I warn people against the use of harsh petroleum-based cleaners in the engine compartment.  They quickly cut through grease and grime, but they also deteriorate your rubber and vinyl components (not to mention what they do to our environment!).  As an alternative, use a citrus- or water-based cleaner.  My  favorites are 303 Aerospace Industrial Cleaner and Autoglym Engine & Machine Cleaner.\n\n\n \nHolly is using a degreaser on the top side of her engine.  Good degreasers are strong enough to cut through the heavy grease and dirt, but some scrubbing is necessary to remove the remaining dirt film.\n \n\nWhen applying your engine degreaser, it's best to start from the lower areas and work your way up.  This prevents the degreaser from dripping on you as you clean the underside areas.  One important thing to remember: the engine degreaser will remove the wax from the painted surfaces of your car.  If you get degreaser overspray on your fenders, plan on re-waxing these areas.\n\nWhen you have applied your engine degreaser, be sure to wash any excess cleaner from the exterior painted surfaces of the fenders, hood and grille.  I like to spray these areas with water first.\n\nDepending on the amount of accumulated grease, allow the degreaser to soak on the engine for 3 to 5 minutes.  Do not allow the degreaser to dry on your engine.  For light to mild levels of grease, you will not need to use a brush on the engine and other surfaces.  For heavy soil, you can use a long-handled brush (parts brush) and car wash solution to provide additional cleaning action prior to hosing off the degreaser.\n\n\n \nUse a soft parts cleaning brush get into cracks and around parts.  If your engine compartment has a heavy accumulation of dirt, you may need to spray with cleaner, brush, and rinse several times.\n \n\n \nAn old toothbrush works great in tight areas that other brushes can't reach. \n \n\nHosing Off\nWhen you are ready to remove the degreaser, hose down the entire engine compartment and surrounding surfaces with plenty of water.  If you're using a high-pressure nozzle, be careful that you don't get the nozzle too close to the covered electrical connectors.  Allow your engine to air dry for several minutes before using a towel to wipe down all accessible parts.  Remove the plastic bags.  The heat from the engine will assist in the drying process; however, do not allow the engine to air dry, as this will result in water spots.  When dry, start your engine and allow it to run for a few minutes.\n\n\n \nRinse with a stiff stream of water to remove as much of the grease and grime as possible.  Be sure to avoid electrical connections and other sensitive areas.  After rinsing, start the engine immediately.  Allow it to run for about 5 minutes to help dry things out.\n \n\n \nHere's a handy tip for you.  After your final rinse use your vacuum (if it can blow forced air) or an air compressor to blow water off the engine for a spot-free finish.  This Vac B' Blow vacuum makes quick work of the job."

And every so often they change and adapt things in this theory when some scientific fact or discovery comes along and begins to expose it. People did not come from monkeys. A piece or two pieces of nothing did not explode and create everything. And evolution disproves itself. It teaches that the strongest species survives. So if that is so why is man still here? Man isn't the strongest species, but he does think. But the original theories say the strongest not the one that can think. So as I said it disproves itself. So now the only logical and factual explanation for existence is GOD!!!"

God chose the Jews to be His people. He wanted to be their king and the law was their constitution, so to speak. The only true theocracy in history! Later, the people asked for an earthly king but the law remained and is still a part of God's covenant with the Jewish people today.\nwhen Jesus came, He observed the law and even more, He fulfilled it. Does that mean it is no longer valid? \nNo, it's still valid. But it's still a covenant between God and the Jewish people. \nWhen the gospel was first preached to Gentiles, some Jewish believers taught, that all Gentiles have to become circumcised and follow the Mosaic law if they want to be followers of Christ.\nThe whole matter is discussed extensively in Acts 15. In the end, the apostles agreed, that Gentiles should not be subject to the law, but that they should be given the following guidelines: abstain from blood, from animals that have been strangled or sacrificed to idols and from sexual immorality. So why do Christians not follow these rules? Because they were not given as a law by God but rather as guidelines by the apostles. \nSo, yes the mosaic law still stands but Gentiles are not required to keep it."

This is due to Euclidean geometry.\nIf you're more of an algebraist, suppose they intersected at more than one point (x1, x2) and (y1, y2). Then ax1 + bx2 = ay1 + by2 and dx1 + ex2 = dy1 + ey2. But then (a-d)x1 + (b-e)x2 = (a-d)y1 + (b-e)y2, so (d-a)/(b-e) = (y2-x2)/(y1-x1). Suppose we chose another point (z1, z2) on the line formed by (y1, y2) and (x1, x2). But note that (z1, z2) will also satisfy the equations, hence the entire line satisfies the equations whenever more than one point satisfies the equation. This is just the first case given above (the lines completely overlap). \nNote the degenerate condition (x1,x2)=(y1,y2) of a single solution gives an undefined quotient 0/0."

"2","in a freely falling body if it experiences acceleration due to gravity then how can it be weightless 'coz w=mg","i'm a class 9 student","Weightlessness is merely a sensation felt by us. It is indeed a misleading term as you would have noticed since it still does have weight as it is still within a gravitational field.\n\nWeightlessness is a term used to describe the situation when a body (or a person) does not feel 'weighed down' by any force. In Physical terms, this merely means that the body does not experience a Normal reaction force, N. \nThis occurs when a body is falling freely, ie, it is undergoing the same acceleration as the acceleration caused by gravity.\n\nHope this clears up any misconceptions that the people who coined the term 'weightless' caused."

"1","Question for Maryland?","I'm considering relocating out of New England and was wondering what life was like in Maryland.  What's the night life like?  Where are the best places to live?  What's minimum wage?  Where are the best beaches?  How much do apartments and houses cost?  What's the price of gas?  How cold does it get in winter?  What are radio stations like?  How's the theater and art scenes?  Things of that nature.","It comes down to what part of MD you move to. If you move to Baltimore or North of if you'll end hanging out in the Inner Harbour or other parts in Baltimore. If you move South of Baltimore, you'll end up spending your night life in Washington, DC. Price of gas is normal like the rest of the country. Winter can be cold to  really cold. Not as bad as MA. Radio stations, again it varies where you decide to move."

"1","If Jesus filled the prophesies for the Messiah, what were they?","Specific quotes please.\n\nBasically I mean what were the alleged prophesies that would let us know who the Messiah was? I've heard people mention them but never quote them.\n\nThe basis of christianity is practically the thought that Jesus is the Messiah. I know that's not the entirety of christian religion, I was christian myself. Please don't try to explain that just answer the prophesies question.","Ha, what a pile of garbage. True the messiah was supposed to be a descendent of king David but that decent is patrilineal (from father to son) Mathew in the first part even shows how jesus was this though his father Josef. But wait. I thought that Jesus was the son of G-d so he cant be a descendant of king David. Strike one. They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."" Isaiah 2:4. This is Isaiah’s prediction of what the messiah supposed to do. Basically world peace look around you. Strike two. The messiah was also supposed to restore the temple in Jerusalem and gather the Jews back to Israel. The temple still has not been built and more than ½ of Jews today don’t live in Israel. Strike three. Jesus is out of there.\nThe truth is Jesus did not fulfill ANY of the requirements to be the messiah. And NO WHERE dose it say any in the writings before Jesus thing about someone coming to cleanse sin or getting a second chance at it latter. (if you want the bible quotes to support the rest of my augment email me at Gratvol@yahoo.com)\n\n\n\noh and dcomputerman if all you needed to be was the son of a woman descendant of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and from the tribe of Judah line of King David I have just a good chance of being the Messiah as Jesus did."

"2","Why does Earth have gravity, but other planets do not?","I just watched a program on PBS Nova and they were talking about Newtons theory of relativity and how it relates to gravity.  They mentioned a sort of fabric that creates the pull on the Earth.  My question is, how come the other planetes do not have this?","Anything with mass has gravity - the bigger the mass the bigger the gravity.  The moon which is quite small compared to earth has much less gravity - look at the footage of the sapcewalks.  Larger planets such as Jupiter or Saturn have much higher gravity - probably so much so that you'd be crushed under your own weight.\n\nThe moon's gravity affects the earth (most noticably in the tides) and to a much lesser extent the other bodies in the solar system affects the earth."

"1","What was the actual SIN of Sodom & Gamorrah?","Most theist, especially those claiming to be ""christian,"" claim that is was homosexuality when in fact ""homosexuality"" is not even mentioned anywhere in the Genesis 13 account  As a matter of fact, you can read the sin of Sodom in Ezekiel:\n\n "" `Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were ARROGANT, OVEFED and UNCONCERNED; they DID NOT HELP the POOR and NEEDY.  EZE 16:49\n\nIt appears that the people became self indulgent and did not care for the needs of others.  Sounds a lot like most of us in this modern era.  Thank God that Jesus was sent for our redemption.","I think first off you have a wrong idea of what sin is, and so your question becomes difficult to answer.  \n\nSin is often thought of by modern day people as an act that one does that God does not approve of.  This is a fine definition in some respects, however when one begins to speak of God, this definition is hardly adequate, because it leaves open the possibility of one being able not to sin, which scripture clearly teaches against.  Sin could better be defined, (as it was in the ancient church) as separation from God, or even as a loss of the ""image of God"" which was bestowed upon Adam and Eve at their creation.  When one thinks of sin in those terms there is not a specific sin that caused God to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, instead there is a lack of faith, or realtionship with God.  This faith, or Relationship comes from the promise of God given to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:15-16, that One will come from Eve's womb whom Satan will pierce but who will crush Satan's head.  Only when God works through that means can one have faith, which none had in Sodom and Gomorrah.  Further more, when one looks at the book of Matthew (25:40ff) one understands what Ezekiel was saying.  With out faith, one cannot do good works to serve their neighbor.  However at the time when God puts Himself into relationship with man, everything that they do is a good work, and consequently, in their faith relationship they are not arrogant, overfed, unconcerned, and they help the poor and needy.  \n\nIn the end you are right with your last statement in the question: ""It appears that the people became self indulgent and did not care for the needs of others. Sounds a lot like most of us in this modern era. Thank God that Jesus was sent for our redemption."""
"2","does anybody know what a heat shock does or what it is?","","Heat shock ot thermal shock, is the effect heating or cooling has on an object. Think of a car engine. Every time you start it, the temperature of the engine goes from ambient to a few hundred degrees. It's like hitting it with a huge hammer every time you start it. This shock could effect the material in different ways, just like heating an object does. Steel will become more and more brittle, aluminum looses strength.\nAlso, thermal shock can happen when an object is heated unevenly. An iron bar heated on one end will cause it to expand on the heated end. The cooler end will not expand as much as you heat the bar. The uneven heating causes stresses as part of the bar expands and part doesn't."
"1","Would it be a good idea to burn my old Bibles?","Im thinking the smoke will eventually find its way to Heaven, which is pretty comforting and doesnt make me feel bad about burning them.

(dont laugh, im not KKK, im serious). I think itd be a neat little offering.","RATHER THAN BURNING THEM DONATE THEM TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT CAN USED THEM TO TEACH OTHERS THAT THERE IS A GOD AND THAT ALL SCRIPTURE IS THE HOLY INSPIRATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD FATHER OF US ALL .IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT OFFERING TO GOD OFFER YOURSELF TO HIM AND THAT WILL PLEASE HIM.HE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OFFERING AND WILL BECOME YOUR ETERNAL GUIDING LIGHT AND SHOW YOU HIS GLORY WHICH WILL CONVINCE YOU OF WHO HE IS AND OF WHO YOU ARE.IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AND OFFERING THAT'S PLEASING TO GOD SEEK HIM IN PRAYER AND ASK HIM WHAT YOU SHOULD DO WITH ALL THOSE BIBLES,HE WILL INDICATE TO YOU WHAT STEP TO TAKE AND THAT, MY FRIEND WILL BE YOUR 1ST. STEP IN WALKING TOWARDS SALVATION.I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WANT TO BURN WHAT CAN SAVE YOU  OR SAVE OTHERS.PLEASE FIND A BETTER WAY TO MAKE AND OFFERING,DON'T OFFER TO OFFEND THE HOLY SPIRIT OF FATHER GOD.JUST BY RECONSIDERING THE QUESTION YOU POSE YOU WILL BE OPENING YOURSELF TO THE GRACE OF GOD.IF YOU DECIDED TO BURN THOSE  BIBLES YOU WOULD BE OFFERING TO BURN WISDOM THAT CAN COME TO YOU.THE BEST OFFERING YOU CAN MAKE IS TO OFFER HIM THE SPACE IN YOUR HEART,OFFER HIM YOUR PAIN FOR HIS GRACE HE WILL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT DEAL INSTANTLY.HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO MAKES THOSE TYPES OF DEAL,INSTANTLY PEACE,MERCY LOVE ABUNDANCE OF FEAR OF GOD WILL FILL YOU AND WILL REMAIN WITH YOU FOR EVER.HE LOVES YOU A WOULD RATHER HAVE YOUR HEART IN OFFERRING THAN THE BURNT BIBLES.

"1","what religion(s) beside Christianity evangelize because they care about other people's souls?","If anyone has anything to say like ""Christians dont care bout other peoples souls"" then dont even bother putting an answer.","Only the christian sects evangelize, with the exception of Catholics.  Good Christians do care for others souls but through my own personal experience, most should practice the ""remove the board from your own eye, before removing the mote in your neighbors"".  I myself cannot stand to be preached at.  I feel that any religion that has to push itself onto people to prove themselves to be right should look at 2 non-evangelical religions for evidence that it is not neccessary: they are the Jewish faiths and true Islam (not the militant fanaticism).  They have out grown Christianity as the largest practices religions.  However the oldest is that of the Pagan sects.  It has continued to flourish and grow in spite of oppressive evangelical religions.  Why? because we keep to ourselves and just practicing being the best we can in our daily lives.  Realizing that we must be good to ourselves before we can do good for others, and without religious overtones.  That is true good works, when it is done because it needs to be and not in the name of a religion."
"2","According to the Bible,earth is 6000 years old and then the science fact is : the earth 65 Billion years old?","","Scientific evidence suggests that the Earth is actually around 4 billion years old.

Thus, that prediction of the Bible is probably incorrect, although that doesn't mean that you should disregard the Bible."

Just walk away. \n\nNow that you have lost your belief, religion and the church are an irrelevance and a curiosity. They have no legal claim to you. If they do send you stuff just asked to be removed from their lists. You may have friends from church - if they respect you and are open to other ideas they will remain your friends now that you have left. If they don't they clearly weren't worth the effort anyway. \n\nGo out, see the world, experience the world for what it is rather than through the dark glasses that religion forces upon you. It is much more beautiful that way."

"2","How do hand warmers work?","I went skiing the other day and used some hand warmers.  I noticed that the instructions indicated simply to expose the warmers to the air, and that the ingredients listed an iron compound, among others.  I suppose this compound undergoes some sort of exothermic reaction involving oxidation once exposed to the air, but I was wondering if anyone knew the specific reaction?","Hand warmers are small (sometimes disposable) packets which are held in the hand and produce heat on demand to warm cold hands.\n\nThey are commonly used in outdoor activities such as hiking and skiing to keep the extremities warm and assist insulated clothing. Other types of warmers are available to provide soothing heat for muscular or joint aches.\n\nSome hand warmers contain cellulose, iron, water, activated carbon, vermiculite and salt and produce heat from the exothermic oxidisation of iron when exposed to air.\n\nA second type generate heat through exothermic crystallisation of supercooled molten materials (usually sodium acetate) and are reusable. These can be recharged by boiling the warmers and allowing them to cool. Heating of the pads is triggered by snapping a small metal device buried in the pad which generates shock waves to initiate crystallisation.\n\nA third type uses lighter fluid (lighter fuel) or LPG which is reacted with a platinum catalyst to release heat by oxidation reactions. These can be used on many occasions by simply refuelling.\n\nDepending on the type and the source of heat, hand warmers last between 30 minutes (recrystallisation) though to 12 - 24 hours."

"1","What is ""Hyphey"" ?","I am hearing all these punk kids in the mall that are wearing giant t-shirts that go to their ankles and sideways hats talk about ""getting hyphey"" and ""listening to hyphey"".  what the heck is hyphey?","Hyphey is its own branch of hip-hop/rap/whatever you want to call it, that has its roots in the San Francisco/Bay area.  It was a sort of backlash against all the gangster rap, and the negativity and violence that went along with that.  Hyphey is its own culture, with its own music, and its own terminology.  There are some odd seeming rituals, such as ""ghosting,"" where people all get out of a car, and let it idle slowly down the street, while they walk along side--it looks as no one is driving the car because no one is--or its being driven by a ghost.  The culture has a lot to do with partying, love, support of friendships, bonds, and seeking a high or euphoria not so much from alcohol or drug use (but that is still quite part of it,) but more from the experience itself.  It really is in many ways, sort of a very modern, rap-like resurrection of the hippy life-style, or at least those ideals.  There are some excellent articles on the internet if you are a reader.  Sorry I don't have the links saved, but they come up easily under searches."

"2","Oxygen fuels fires, but a gust of wind will blow out a candle - why is this so?","","In a fire, Oxygen is not the fuel, it is the oxidizer.  Depending upon what is burning, the fuel could be any number of things.\nOxygen does not burn, but is required for combustion.\n\nIn order for something to burn, 3 things are necessary,\n-Fuel\n-An oxidizer (Oxygen)\n-[activation] Energy\n\nUnless these 3 things are present, the object in question will not burn.\nIf we assume fuel and Oxidizer are plentiful, then the only thing left which will keep something from burning is that extra bit of energy needed to set off the reaction.  After one gets a fire going, usually, this energy is provided by the excess heat the fire generates, but it needs to be supplied initially by some form (for example, lighting a match to start light a candle).\nIf one were to take away the fire's ability to provide its own activation energy, it would go out unless supplemented by some outside source.\n\nWhen a gust of wind blow out a fire, it is blowing away the energy the fire needs to burn, it is cooling it off too much for it to continue burning."

"1","How and why do paedophiles get jobs such as Teachers, Priests and Boyscout Leaders?","Is it me or do all paedophiles reported in the News come from proffsions with close links to kids, especially thechurch which seems to be an haven for kiddy fiddlers and other such vocations as boyscout leaders, teachers and care workers, why are tests on their personality never undertaken and why as the church never done anything about all the sexual deviants hiding under it's wing?","Paedophiles are attracted to jobs that will give them easy access to children.  \n\nI don't at all agree with you when you say that ""little is being done"" about this problem.  In education, for example, anyone who wants to work in a school must undertake a criminal background check.  The problem is with people who are paedophiles, or potential paedophiles but who have no criminal record.  There is also a problem with people who have been suspected but never convicted, in a legal system that has a presumption of innocence until guilt is proven.

"1","For Christians only, is going to heaven the same as inheriting the kingdom of God?","1 Cor 6:9 says that the unrighteous (ie unbelievers) will not inherit the kingdom of God.  The unrighteous cannot inherit because they are not sons of God which believers are.\nGal 5:19-21 says that those who do the works of the flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God.  Here believers who sin (ie engaged in the works of the flesh)\ncannot inherit the kingdom of God.  Believers who are sons of God are disqualified from their inheritance because of sins.\nIn Rom 14:17  Apostle Paul defines the kingdom of God to be righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\nA believer who sins is not disqualified from going to heaven but he would not inherit the kingdom of God in the sense that he will not enjoy righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.  I have consistently used the writings of Paul\nto come to this conclusion.  Any helpful comments, brothers and sisters in the Lord ?","Yes indeed.I was studying these issues myself.Here's my conviction.Justification is only by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and it is once and for all.Let God be true and man a liar.The transaction is done once and for all.The seal is done and no one can steal it from Christ.However,if you read the book of Revelation along with Daniel you will see that in the white throne judgement the believers in Christ and those who have rejected Christ will be separated by Christ himself like sheep is separated from goats.Which is a very sad thing and that is the reason why we Christians are supposed to be the salt of  the earth and light.So we (The believers in Christ )escape the final judgement.But all is not over.Now starts the judgement of the believers---do we enter heaven with honour or in dishonour?That is question we all need to ask now.Imagine living the rest of our lives in dishonour.Do we have any crowns to lay at His feet as our worship in eternity or not ,or shall we go empty handed standing before the Lord,with our heads hanging in shame???That is why Paul refers our life on earth like that of an athelete---breasting the tape alone will not determine our award but whether we are following the rules applicable;if an athelete does not follow rules of the race then imagine after running the race and comming 1st only to be told publicly he is disqualified for the award.That is very sad indeed!!!There are many more illustrations from every day life given in the Bible from which we all can understand simply.I believe God did not give His Word to us to keep it as a secret,his love for mankind was made a public spectacle when Christ gave his life on the cross willingly (and yet the world rejects it so much tragecally!!)so that you and I and all those who believe may not perish but have everlasting life.We are now co-heirs with Christ, therefore we inherit the Kingdom of heaven, not because of our deeds but by the act of Christ on the Cross.He gave us the authority to His children therefore we will live with him in heaven after our life on earth is over.Capture the image of the scene of the rupture!!!Oh! Death where is your sting!!!It is so powerful.He loves people His creation that he does not want even one to perish but it is we who reject His salvation for mankind.Jesus is a thorough gentleman, he never forces His way into anyone's life.His love is for the asking only.His heart is to preserve. I love The Word of God because it is so alive and speaking to me even in this decade.I also trust that  even as you seek the many question if you seek with all your heart He shall reveal it and The Truth shall set you free indeed.So the bottom line is whether we will enter heaven in honour or in shame?Amen."

"1","What is the difference between accents and dialects?","I'm writing an essay for college about the history of the English language.  I'm having a difficult time understanding the difference between the different accents in England before the Norman conquest and the different dialects in England after the Norman conquest.  Could someone help explain the difference between accents and dialects?  My dictionary only says that accents are different styles of pronunciation and dialects are different forms of pronunciation... and this still leaves me confused.","Yes, I can see why you would be confused by your dictionary's definition on this topic.\n\nAccent refers to the sounds that are present in a person's language.  Pronunciation is basically a synonym of accent.  Therefore, if I pronounce differently from someone, I have a different accent.\n\nDialect is something greater.  A dialect is a version of a language that is special to a particular region or group.  Dialects of the same language are different from each other, but still understandable to speakers of another dialect of that language.  For example, American English and British English are two dialects of English.  They have some differences, such as in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but they are still understandable to each other.\n\nIn your specific question, then, differences between dialects includes more than just differences in pronunciation.  I suppose that the reason your dictionary isn't precise on this is that accent(pronunciation) is often a pretty noticeable feature of dialect.  In other words, if I am interacting with a speaker of another dialect of my language, I will probably notice it first because of the differences in accent."

For groups, look at the image of 1 in Z/nZ.  The image will have order at most n, but everything in Z other than 0 has infinite order. Thus, the image of 1 is 0, so all images are 0 and we have the zero homomorphism. For rings, the image of 1 has to be 1 and we just showed that is impossible."

"2","Whats Engineering?","","Engineering is the application of scientific or mathematical principles to develop economical solutions to technical problems, creating products, facilities, and structures that are useful to people.[1][2] One who practices engineering is called an engineer, and those licensed to do so have formal designations such as Professional Engineer. Engineers use imagination, judgment, and reasoning to apply science, technology, mathematics, and practical experience. The result is the design, production, and operation of useful objects or processes. The broad discipline of engineering encompasses a range of specialized subdisciplines that focus on the issues associated with developing a specific kind of product, or using a specific type of technology."

"2","what are the steps in tea processing?","","The plucked tea is weighed before being taken to the factory for processing or “making”, as tea manufacture is known in the trade. Some 30-35 kg (66-77 lb) of plucked leaf makes some 7.5-9 kg (17-20 lb) of black tea, which is the type of tea that has the major share of the market in terms of production, sales, and consumption.\n\nThere are five stages in the tea-making process. Withering is the first stage, in which the plucked leaf is spread on vast trays or racks, and left to wither in air temperatures of 25-30° C (77-86° F) for a period of 10-16 hours, depending on the wetness of the leaf. As the leaf moisture evaporates the leaves become flaccid. In the next stage, the withered leaf is broken by machine, releasing the natural leaf juices. The broken leaf is produced by “orthodox” and “unorthodox” mechanized methods, the orthodox method producing larger leaf particles, or grades, and the unorthodox method producing smaller grades. These smaller grades are more suited to modern market demands for a quick-brewing finished product.\n\nDuring the fermentation stage, the broken leaf is spread on trays or put in troughs. On contact with the air, the released enzymes (from the leaf juices) oxidize. The leaf is turned from time to time until each tray or trough is full of a rusty-brown coloured leaf. Drying, often called firing, is the next stage. The fermented leaf is fed slowly through a warm air chamber, which extracts the moisture, emerging as a dark brown dried leaf, known as black tea.\n\nDuring the final stage, known as sorting, the black tea is fed into a machine fitted with a series of sieves and outlets. This sorts the grades into chests before its onward journey to auctions, traders, or blenders. The chests are foil-lined to prevent the absorption of unpleasant odours or the loss of aroma during shipment. In China, tea is sometimes allowed to absorb the scent from various flowers; jasmine is a particular favourite.\n\nThere are two main grades—pekoe and broken pekoe (the word “pekoe” is a corruption of the Chinese word for the white down found on the back of young leaves). Each grade is subdivided into further categories as the leaf particles decline in size. Fannings and dust grades are the two smallest particles. Other terms are used to describe the colour and content of the black tea leaf. For example, Broken Orange Pekoe and Tippy Broken Orange Pekoe are the names given to teas with a lot of bud in the blend, as the buds tend to turn an orange colour during the make.\n\nBefore the tea is shipped, factory tea-tasters sample the finished make to ensure no mistakes have been made during manufacture. These tasters also send samples of the make to their brokers, agents, and buyers. At the end of each make the factory is washed thoroughly to ensure that the completed make does not contaminate the next."

Some dislike the smell/taste, some find it difficult to do (I've heard things like complaints of tongue cramping, believe it or not), some feel it's beneath them (that a 'real man' can satisfy his woman through penetration alone), some merely don't care about her orgasm and won't do the work for it, some are nervous or feel inexperienced and don't want to do it because they're scared of failing (they don't know how to locate the clitoris; and some women are slightly hard to get off).

( medically disease accurately shows this ) \n\n2.  thought is probably ""stored"" in the brain ( memories retrieved and amnesia )\n\n3.  thought may not exist at all but may be an illusion to which we assign a word ""thought"" .  this illusion is actually the process of the elecrohemical reactions themselves. this illusion is abolished when you sleep or are unconscious.  \n\n4. this illusion is called consciousness and is more metaphysical in nature.  ( i.e not a subject for the sciences ).\n\n5. i believe consciousness is a subjective experience which in some individuals opens an infinity of questions and in others be a solved problem ( e.g. state of nirvana or cosmic union ). in other words, its a matter of accepting a belief.\n\n6. i dont think your question can be approach rationally since the question itself is a thought .  in other words,  the answer to what a thought is made of is only another thought and so on ad infinitum.......\n\n7.  you may want to read ""the physics of consciousness"" for a good scientific survey of your question.\n\n:)"

Long-lived radioactive elements such as uranium are used instead."

(Hint: Do you think everyone who used the machine lost 10 pounds?)\n\nWhat else would you want to know before making critical decisions on allocating discretionary capital (on the exercise machine)?","I'd want to know who ran the study and who paid for the study.\n\nI would want to know the number of people taking part in the study.  Of course, it is extremely unlikely that everyone taking part in the study lost 10 pounds.  ""Average"" implies that some people lost more and some people lost less.  If ""average"" is the mean average, it could be that a small number of people who lost a lot of weight could have distorted the average.  Knowing the median weight loss might be very revealing.\n\nIt would be good to know how long each person used the machine for and what other exercise were they doing.  Even if the majority did lose 10 pounds a day, it doesn't mean that their 10 pound a day weight loss was caused by the exercise machine.  They might have been dieting."

"2","How we (human beings) will look like/ our appearance after 10,000 years? (considering evolution as the key)?","","We have totally removed natural selection, a key requirement for a being to evolve.  If anything we will become less robust, less strong, less health, and less successful because there is no need for it.    \n\nGeography is also no longer a boundry, so there aren't any more isolated groups evolving independently.   With the spread of people across the word, the average person will look more and more like a mix of everyone else:  eg. most will have medium complexion, most will have brown hair.\n\nHowever, if your scenarion will allow for natural disasters or plagues, the end result is unforseeable.   Those who survive a period of plague will have better immune systems and generally more healthy.   Those who survive a disaster like a world-wide drought or flood will be those with the best survival instincts:  clever, resourceful, excellent social smarts, more fit and more efficient metabolism."

"2","Is Pluto still considered as a Planet under Solar system Milkyway?","","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto\n\non 24 august 2006, the international astronomical union reclassified pluto.\n\npluto does orbit the sun, is ball-shaped and is not a satellite, but it does not have an isolated orbit (a bunch of other similar bodies have similar orbits.) so it is not a planet.\n\ni have been waiting for this since i was about ten when i learned that pluto didn't fit the pattern set by the major bodies in the solar system so it was an anomaly. it just felt ""out of place"". now that astronomers have found hundreds of other bodies with similar orbits, classifying ""134340 pluto"" as a planet is even more irrational. i feel somewhat satisfied, but i don't know how long this will drag on tho. many planetary astronomers are satisfied that the definition is rigorous enuf. i can accept that the definition is flawed, but i can not accept that ""134340 pluto"" is a planet.\n\nthis was the right thing to do, believe me. this does not change anything about pluto or the solar system. this just corrects the mistake of classifying pluto as a planet initially.\n\nthis same thing happened has happened before.  in 1800, an astronomer found a body orbiting between the orbits of mars and jupiter and thought it was a planet.  astronomers finally stopped classifying them as planets after they found several other bodies with similar orbits, and no one thinks ceres, pallas, juno, and vesta are planets today.\n\nmany astronomers consider pluto and charon to be a binary system, but two small bodies orbit that system. they are called nix and hydra.\n\nincidentally, ""134340 pluto"" was never a moon of neptune. neptune did capture triton. this is why triton has a retrograde orbit"

"2","What is geology?","","Geology is the science and study of the Earth, its composition, structure, physical properties, history and the processes that shape it. It is one of the Earth sciences. Geologists have helped establish the age of the Earth at about 4.6 billion  years, and have determined that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust, is fragmented into tectonic plates that move over a rheic upper mantle (asthenosphere) via processes that are collectively referred to as plate tectonics. Geologists help locate and manage the earth's natural resources, such as petroleum and coal, as well as metals such as iron, copper, and uranium. Additional economic interests include gemstones and many minerals such as asbestos, perlite, mica, phosphates, zeolites, clay, pumice, quartz, and silica, as well as elements such as sulfur, chlorine, and helium.\n\nAstrogeology refers to the application of geologic principles to other bodies of the solar system. However, specialised terms such as selenology (studies of the Moon), areology (of Mars), etc., are also in use.\n\nThe word ""geology"" was first used by Jean-André Deluc in the year 1778 and introduced as a fixed term by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in the year 1779. An older meaning of the word was first used by Richard de Bury. He used it to distinguish between earthly and theological jurisprudence."

"2","Why does load music make your ears ring?","I went to a Gig last night and came out with my ears ringing - they were still ringing the next morning! Why do your ears ring after a gig and does it do any permanent damage?","Taken from Anderson, Brett, The treble and the damage done…\nVol. 20, Twin Cities Reader, 01-11-1995, pp 15. Sometimes my ears ring dull and low. I hear something that sounds like a cross between the hum of a Hammond organ and the purr of a well-tuned luxury car. Other times the noise is a faint, high squeal that alternately surges and recedes like surf. Most often, my head hisses like the inside of seashell, causing a cool sensation that feels like my ears are leaking gas. As unpredictable as the nature of my own private echoes might be, it’s certain that I will awake from a night spent sucking down loud rock music with a hangover that has nothing to do with booze.\n\nI’m not alone.\n\n“What happens is the hair cells are damaged, but they’re not dead,” Dr. Sam Levine (an otolarynologist) explains. “As they’re damaged, you lose some of your hearing. Most of the time, if you get out of the environment, your hair cells will recover somewhat. Each day, it [your hearing] comes back, but not as good as it did the day before. Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged instead of temporarily damaged.”\n\nMost people would rather believe that hearing loss is like car accidents, violent crime and tax audits - something that affects other people. There are some famous cases. Who guitarist"

"2","Why is some ocean water in specific regions very clear and some very dirty?","","Clear water needn't be clean water (chemically), it only has few solids floating in it.\n\nHow clear water can be depends on a variety of factors.\n\nPlankton: even clear water contains myriads of microbial plankton. Most of it is colourless, but algae have various dyes used for changing light energy into chemical energy. Algae can bloom where the temperatures are right, there are enough nutrients, and there is sufficient light.\n\nClay minerals: Marine sediment as well as riverine detritus contains finely ground minerals which can be stirred up by even slight mechanical force. How much and which grain size can and will be stirred up depends on wave action and sediment make-up. Rocky or large-particle beaches will have clearer water than muddy beaches with the same conditions.\n\nWhat can be blamed on human influence? Mainly the nutrient contents of the water, mostly from agricultural fertilizers and to a somewhat lesser content waste water from settlements or industry. Plus occasional severe cases of extreme pollution like oil etc.\n\nHow clear the water appears is only one of several quality criteria. There won't be many algae in sea water polluted by biocides, but though clear that water won't be pure..."
"2","Does the change in enviroment cause the organisms that live on a rotting log die or run away?","This is the question.While walking ina forested area one day with her pupils,Mdm Tan found a rotting log on the ground.Upon a closer look,she disovered that it had a number of organisms crawling on its surface,some growing on it and others hidden in it.//Mdm Tan was delighted as she felt that this could be used as a specimen to teach her class about rotting log community Also other teachers could also use it to teach their class.//After bringing  the rotting log back with the help of her pupils,Mdm Tan placed it at the back of the class,ona table near the window.//Unfortunately,2 days later,the rotting log could no longer be used as a specimen.Most of the organisms had died and some had disappeared.//What happened?What could Mdm Tan do to keep the rotting log in the same condition as she first found it?","Yes, if you take something thats adapt to its enviroment and place it in a different enviroment it will die, or try to find a suitable enviroment. This is only with organisms that are weaker then some and cant adapt fast enough. Often the most simple organism is the strongest, without heating and air conditioning humans would have alot of problems with moving, even from the central united states to the southern states.

"1","Who exactly is Allah?","Ok, I know that Allah means God, and he is who Muslims pray to. But is Allah the same God that Christians pray to? I know that Muslims beleive in Moses and in Jesus, but they also believe in Mohammend. Muslims believe in Mohammend the same way that Christians believe in Jesus right? So if Muslims beleive in Jesus and Moses, then is Allah and God the exact same person/entity? Or is Allah totally seperate, like Buddah is? I am confused.","First of all, I am happy for you because of asking this question, since you are asking about none but your Creator, and as to your question.. well..\n\nLet us agree first that The Creator must be the creator of\neverything, the heavens, the earth an all that is in between them, mankind and all that exists. It is anticipated that anyone who says\n“I believe in the Creator,” that he believes in this. It also entails that he should necessarily believe that the Creator possesses Perfect Attributes. He is Perfect in His attributes, in Himself, in His Names,and in His Actions. This is a natural flow,\notherwise, it is a delusion not a true belief in the ""Creator.""\n""I believe in a Perfect Creator,"" should lead to another obvious admission: if you believe that the Creator is Perfect then He is\nPerfectly Wise in all of His Actions. Does He then Create because of a Perfect Wisdom, or aimlessly? This is the important linkage. Does He Create for a need? Or He\nCreates based upon Wisdom? It is anticipated that to be in harmony with having belief in the Creator, that His\nWisdom is necessarily is linked to His Knowledge, His Will and to all of His Attributes. The question, therefore, would you think the One who creates does so for a purpose or He creates to leave the creation aimless? The person who believes the Creator is Perfect, would agree that His creating is not aimless. If so, then Who else other than Allaah has stated this? And\nyou know where? It is in His Final Revelation to man. Contemplate what He has said: ""Did you think that We have created you in play without any purpose and that you\nwill not be brought back to us, so exalted be Allaah the true king none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the\nSupreme Throne” [Quran 23: 115-116]. Does man think that he will be left aimless (without purpose)? [Quran, 75:36].\nSo Allaah is the One whom you believe to be ""the Creator."" He chose this title for Himself and He stated that He is the Only\nCreator, and that He Creates with Wisdom: Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no god but He: Then\nhow ye are deluded away from the Truth! [Qur'an, 40:62].\nSo this creation which Allaah creates must have a code organizing its existence and its aims. \nHence: 1- Allaah creates and His creating is all Wise and for a purpose.\n2- Allaah did not leave us aimless. He set a code to live accordingly. So He legislates, commands, and prohibits,\nand justly sets reward and accountability, because He is all-\nJust.\n3- In all aspects of this code, the manifestations of His Names and Attributes become known, contemplated and realized. Being\nthe Creator necessitates creating as well as purpose, guidance and legislations. Whoever ascribes is rewarded, since He is the Most Generous. When one commits a sin,he realizes that his Creator accepts repentance and is oft-Forgiving. So the manifestations of Allaah's Names and Attributes become\nrealized on earth and this is beloved to Allaah, the Creator.\n4- Allaah gives man life, physical sustenance, and spiritual\nguidance through the revelation which He entrusted His Messengers with [like Jesus the son of Mary, Moses and Muhammed]. He guides man to know how to benefit\nfrom the provisions, what is good for him and what is harmful. He raises in honor those who submitted to Him,\nand justly puts in humiliation those who disdain and are arrogant. He Forgives and is Merciful; He punishes and rewards in order that man shapes his life with the code that is all beneficial to man and which makes his life on this earth upright. And it cannot be upright unless man ascribes to the guidance sent to him by His\ncreator.\n5- If all mankind come to ascribe to his code (i.e. worship) Allaah on one heart, then this does not oblige any change in Allaah's Essence nor in His Attributes. If all the creation is on one heart, this does not increase in the dominion of Allaah anything.\nThat is"

"2","how cooperation between humoral and cellular immunity occure?","","Humoral immunity cannot happen without cellular immunity.\n\nHumoral immunity is provided by B-lymphocytes, which produce antibodies.  In order for B-lymphs to become active in producing antibodies, they need to be presented with an antigen.  Monocytes are components of cellular immunity.  Monos encounter a foreign body, say a bacteria.  They recognize it as foreign through the bacteria's antigens and ingest it by phagocytosis.  Once the bacteria has been eaten by the monocyte, it is digested and the antigens on it's surface are transported to the surface of the monocyte.  The monocyte then goes and finds a B-lymph and ""shows"" it the antigen.  The B-lymphs then start making antibodies to that antigen.  Monocytes are known as Antigen Presenting Cells because of this action.\n\nI hope this answers your question."

"1","Isn't it best for a minister or evangelist to have no interest in sexuality whatsoever.?","In the bible it says that it is better for a man to be single.

But nothing encourages me about being with a woman. I feel like I would be trapped and unable to do the things I want to do. I've had relationships in the past that where not anything I would like to experience again. And the older I get the less Important relationships are to me. There is only one who I feel that has the capability of showing real love and thats God himself. I don't believe people are able to give me what I need, only God.

While I have been raised Christian I can most identify with the latter of the three, but all gays and lesbians have encountered issues with these religions because they are all Abrahamic and therefor take many similar opions on the subject with one another.\n\nThe one religion I was brought up-Christian-is becoming more gay friendly in these devisive times.  While Catholocism has taken a strong stance against homosexuality-it still has followers who are organised to fight for gay rights within its church.  The American Episcopal Church of course has appointed a gay bishop in Massachussets which makes a bold statement on how that denomination is prepared to include gays and lesbians.  Also the Prespyterian Church has recently voted to allow gays and lesbians to be ministers and lay-people at the local level  (See link below).\n\nAs for personal experience, I have to admit I am feeling less Christian as I experience more rejection and hatred from Christian communities.  While there is progress being made, I find that while most churches are teaching inclusion-it is under the pretense that being homosexual is still wrong and that gays and lesbians should be accepted out of pity with the expectations that they should repent for their sexuality.  I disagree with this as gays and lesbians should be accepted into a Christian community free of the supposed guilt and stigma attached to their sexuality.\n\nThere are pro-gay Christian oranisations operating-though I have never attended their services.  The Universalists I have been told are very supportive of their gay followers."

"1","Can you be an agnostic-christian?  Or is that just ""riding the fence""?","","Pascal seems to think so.  He set up this argument that it is better to live as a Christian than not to, just in case Christianity is true.  Well, to choose to live according to Christianity on that basis clearly indicates that one is an agnostic in reality.  But Pascal said that actions create belief, so that if you act like a Christian, before you know it, voila, you will believe in it!\n\nOf course, the major difficulty with Pascal's wager as I see it, is that he failed to factor in other religions.  What if Islam is right?  Then you've gambled on the wrong religion.\n\nBut anyhow, I DO believe that you can be an Agnostic Christian, an Agnostic Hindu, an Agnostic almost anything.  Because you are being very honest.  You are admitting that ultimately, no one knows.  And yet you still have your inclinations.  You are justified to follow the religion that you are inclined to most believe in, whether or not you are able to believe 100% in it or not.\n\nMost Christians have doubts, and some admit this.  There is not so much difference between a Christian with doubts and an ""agnostic-Christian"" perhaps."

MY mom and dad says taht as longs as I have a religion it's ok, as I'm an adult and old enough to do what I want.  So explain to me what are the pros and cons of juedaism.","I am Catholic so I will provide you the con of the action.\n\nYou have been baptised into the community of Jesus Christ in the Catholic Church. You have received Christ's Body and Blood at Mass.\n\nJudaism is a fine religion and I respect those who are Jewish. However, they were born and raised Jewish. You, on the other hand, at one point believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and received His flesh into your body.\n\nA religion is not a hobby. It is not a club to belong to. You cannot choose what you think you like the best. Judaism does not agree with this any more than Christianity does.\n\nYou act like you are buying a car and looking for the biggest bang for you buck and don't want to buy a lemon. This is not how God works whether you are Jewish or Christian. If I were you I would rethink just what each religion says their religion is. Because both do not say it is something you can just whimsically choose based upon a list of positives and negatives.\n\nI have the feeling that you don't go to Mass very often. If that is the case then it is obvious why you are leaving the Church. Would I also be correct in saying that you have not read an encyclical or even the writings of any of the Doctors of the Church? What about just reading a modern day apologist like Scott Hahn? Have you really thought this through and truly think you understand Catholicism and find it unappealing? I believe you may be Catholic, but have a misperception of your faith. Your parents have not taught you what Catholicism believes because Catholicism does not believe that as long as you have religion it is ok. It flies in the face of what Christ and the Catholic Church say about religion.\n\nI would strongly suggest that before you leave a faith that you have accepted (remember from Baptism the Holy Spirit is in you) you should come to understand just what you are leaving. Because it is no little thing to convert from the Catholic Church. If you had once believed in Christ then you are sinning by leaving your faith in Him."

"1","how and why do you celebrate cinco de mayo?","","The 5th of May is not Mexican Independence Day, but it should be!  And Cinco de Mayo is not an American holiday, but it should be.  Mexico declared its independence from mother Spain on midnight, the 15th of September, 1810.  And it took 11 years before the first Spanish soldiers were told and forced to leave Mexico. \n\nSo, why Cinco de Mayo?  And why should Americans savor this day as well?  Because 4,000 Mexican soldiers smashed the French and traitor Mexican army of 8,000 at Puebla, Mexico, 100 miles east of Mexico City on the morning of May 5, 1862. \n\nThe French had landed in Mexico (along with Spanish and English troops) five months earlier on the pretext of collecting Mexican debts from the newly elected government of democratic President (and Indian) Benito Juarez.  The English and Spanish quickly made deals and left.  The French, however, had different ideas. \n\nUnder Emperor Napoleon III, who detested the United States, the French came to stay.  They brought a Hapsburg prince with them to rule the new Mexican empire.  His name was Maximilian; his wife, Carolota.  Napoleon's French Army had not been defeated in 50 years, and it invaded Mexico with the finest modern equipment and with a newly reconstituted Foreign Legion.  The French were not afraid of anyone, especially since the United States was embroiled in its own Civil War. \n\nThe French Army left the port of Vera Cruz to attack Mexico City to the west, as the French assumed that the Mexicans would give up should their capital fall to the enemy -- as European countries traditionally did. \n\nUnder the command of Texas-born General Zaragosa, (and the cavalry under the command of Colonel Porfirio Diaz, later to be Mexico's president and dictator), the Mexicans awaited.  Brightly dressed French Dragoons led the enemy columns.  The Mexican Army was less stylish. \n\nGeneral Zaragosa ordered Colonel Diaz to take his cavalry, the best in the world, out to the French flanks.  In response, the French did a most stupid thing; they sent their cavalry off to chase Diaz and his men, who proceeded to butcher them.  The remaining French infantrymen charged the Mexican defenders through sloppy mud from a thunderstorm and through hundreds of head of stampeding cattle stirred up by Indians armed only with machetes. \n\nWhen the battle was over, many French were killed or wounded and their cavalry was being chased by Diaz' superb horsemen miles away.  The Mexicans had won a great victory that kept Napoleon III from supplying the confederate rebels for another year, allowing the United States to build the greatest army the world had ever seen.  This grand army smashed the Confederates at Gettysburg just 14 months after the battle of Puebla, essentially ending the Civil War. \n\nUnion forces were then rushed to the Texas/Mexican border under General Phil Sheridan, who made sure that the Mexicans got all the weapons and ammunition they needed to expel the French.  American soldiers were discharged with their uniforms and rifles if they promised to join the Mexican Army to fight the French.  The American Legion of Honor marched in the Victory Parade in Mexico, City. \n\nIt might be a historical stretch to credit the survival of the United States to those brave 4,000 Mexicans who faced an army twice as large in 1862.  But who knows? \n\nIn gratitude, thousands of Mexicans crossed the border after Pearl Harbor to join the U.S. Armed Forces.  As recently as the Persian Gulf War, Mexicans flooded American consulates with phone calls, trying to join up and fight another war for America. \n\nMexicans, you see, never forget who their friends are, and neither do Americans.  That's why Cinco de Mayo is such a party -- A party that celebrates freedom and liberty.  There are two ideals which Mexicans and Americans have fought shoulder to shoulder to protect, ever since the 5th of May, 1862.  VIVA! el CINCO DE MAYO!!"

Keep away any source of cells - dead or alive (well other than the tissue or cells from which you want to prepare RNA)! So keep your bench clean, use gloved hands etc. Use sterile solutions. If possible, use 'baked' containers.\n\n2. Use RNAse degrading reagents (e.g., RNAse away and/or DEPC -see Sigma catalogue; ambion is a company specialized in RNA-related products, you can try their catalogue/website too) in your solutions.\n\n3. Use RNAse free disposable labwares (like tips and tubes) as much as possible.\n\nABOVE steps should take care of the notorius RNAse enzyme that is present in most of the cells and hard to be inactivated.\n\n4. Use 'RNAse-free DNAse' wherever possible. This avoids DNA contamination.\n\n5. Extend your precautions to the gel electrophoretic analysis and storage of prepared RNA also!\n\nRest: Stick to your protocol"

Galileo is generally credited with making one and using it specifically for astronomy but he was not the first to make one.\n\n""The first telescopes may have been Assyrian crystal lenses[1], but the Visby lenses tentatively suggest that the technology was known to the Arabs and Persians. Leonard Digges is sometimes credited with the invention in England in the 1570s, but usually credit for assembling the first telescope is given to an unknown Dutch spectacle maker in about 1608. Some name that person as Hans Lippershey (c. 1570 – c. 1619), but Jacob Metius and Zacharias Jansen also claimed to have invented a telescope during the same period. Even if Lippershey did not make the first one, he publicized it. Galileo Galilei made his own telescope in 1609, calling it at first a ""perspicillum,"" and then using the terms ""telescopium"" in Latin and ""telescopio"" in Italian (from which the English word derives). Galileo is generally credited with being the first to use a telescope for astronomical purposes"""
"1","do filipinos speak english very well?","","I am proud to say that most of us speak very good English compared to our other Asian counterparts.  Our medium of instruction in our schools is English.  We boast of our quality schools (not to mention the cheap fees) so that a lot of foreign students come here to pursue their studies.\n\nBut, similarly in other countries, we, too, have a share of those who don't speak English well.  We cannot even rule out that a number of Americans or British speak grammatically incorrect English (even incorrect spelling of words when these are written).  They may have the advantage of speaking it fast than us Filipinos but I am sure we do not lag behind when it comes to speaking and writing them in correct grammar and spelling.  And it was a FILIPINA who won an extemporaneous speech held in London some two years back (I just couldnt remember anymore her name)!!\n\nIt is the Philippine culture to value education very highly.  Filipino parents strive hard to provide education for their children.  Come to the Philippines and every little child of school age understands, comprehends and converses English when u talk to them .  There are even countries whose people don't even understand a word of English, thereby needing you to exert much effort with hand signals, lol.\n\nWe are proud to be Filipinos!"

"2","What is a double-blind clinical study?","","Double-blind means that both the researcher and the subject are 'blinded' as to which group the subject is in.\n\nFor instance, if you are testing a drug for blood pressure, you might give patients in one group the standard drug, and patients in another group the new drug. You would make the capsules for each drug look and taste identical, and label the bottles 'A' and 'B', without either the people taking the drugs, or the people taking the blood pressure measurements, knowing who was getting which drug.\n\nThis is to avoid bias. If a researcher knows a subject is getting a certain treatment (whether it's medical, musical, whatever!), they might consciously or unconsciously bias the results to reflect their belief about the efficacy of the treatment. Double-blinding is now the accepted standard for clinical trials.\n\nRandomization into treatment groups is another important factor, again to try and eliminate bias or confounding factors that might mean you get a positive result for a reason OTHER than that the treatment actually works."

"2","why the liquid oxygen is paramagnetic ?","","A paramagnetic substance contains unpaired electrons and tend to move into a magnetic field.\n\nLiquid oxygen does not exist formally with a double bond linking the two oxygens (O=O).  This form only exists at higher temperatures.  When a liquid at -214 to -183oC it exists as a di-radical.  There is a single bond between each oxygen, and each oxygen holds a single electron in its p-orbital.  The presence of these single electrons impart the paramagnetism.\n\nLiquid oxygen is also a pale blue colour due to the unpaired electrons."

"2","Help finding the following arithmetic sequence ...plz =)?","Find the arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference not equal to 0, whose second, tenth & thirty-fourth terms are the first 3 terms in a geometric sequence.","OK, let's see.\n\nIt's an arithmetic sequence, so the difference between consecutive terms is a constant.  The first term is 1, so we can express each term as:\n\nx(i) = 1 + k*(i-1), i = 1, 2, 3, ....\n\nNext the problem says that the 2nd, 10th, and 34th terms are the first three terms in a geometric sequence.  That means that the ratio of the 10th term to the 2nd term must be the same as the ratio of the 34th term to the 10th, because when you divide any two terms of a geometric sequence, you get the same constant.\n\ni(2) = 1 + 1*k\ni(10) = 1 + 9*k\ni(34) = 1 + 33*k\n\nSo we said i(10)/i(2) must equal i(34)/i(10):\n\n1+9k    1+33k\n-------- = --------\n1+1k      1+9k\n\nCross multiplying: (1+9k)^2 = (1+1k)(1+33k).\n\nThen 1 + 18k + 81k^2 = 1 + 34k + 33k^2.\n\nPutting it all on the left side, 48k^2 - 16k = 0, or 16k(3k - 1) = 0.\n\nSo either k = 0 (not interesting) or k = 1/3.\n\nTherefore the arithmetic sequence must be:\n\n1, 1 1/3, 1 2/3, 2, 2 1/3, 2 2/3, 3, 3 1/3, ....\n\nThe second term is 1 1/3.  The 10th term is 4 (1 + 3 * 1/3).  The 34th term is 12 (1 + 33 * 1/3).  So the geometric progression would be:\n\n4/3, 4, 12, 48, 192, ....."

Equations of lines in 3-space are VECTOR equations with a simple form (kind of like slope and intercept): we need a point the line passes through -- (2,-1,0) -- and a direction to go -- parallel to the x-axis.

He used to reside under their deck and never had this problem then.  I'm so mad at them for not controlling this.  It keeps us up at night and wakes us up before the sun rises.  It's so ANNOYING!!!!  What should I do???","No, don’t poison the dog; it’s inhumane.  (Besides, jails are noisy, too.)\n\nIf you haven’t already, talk with your neighbor.  Be aware that neighbors who leave their dogs outside to bark non-stop are sometimes unpleasant, uncooperative people, but they should be aware of the problem and given reasonable time to correct it.  If they won’t, tighten the screws.\n\nKeep a log.  For each day, document the times when the dog barks.  Get a camcorder and video tape it in action.  Leave the date/time stamp on, and be prepared to edit together a “greatest hits” tape (should be no longer than a couple minutes).  Do this for at least two weeks; four is better.  Depending on the neighbor, it might be best to do this secretly; or it might actually be best to let your neighbor see what’s going down.\n\nMeanwhile, check with local law officials or city to see if there's a barking/noise ordinance where you live.  You might also visit http://www.municode.com/resources/online%20Library.asp to see if there’s one.  If there is, call the police or animal control.  Animal control might tell you it’s up to the police to issue citations; the police might tell you animal control handles it.  Or an officer might tell you he has to witness it as it occurs, and the dog decides to take a ten-minute breather during his visit.  You might be told it’s a civil matter; (if there is an ordinance, it is a criminal matter).  Police sometimes won't do their jobs, so you might have to put an officer on camera while the dog’s barking and ask why a citation isn’t being issued.  This _will_ anger the officer, but your neighbor will certainly get the citation.  It will go to court, and you will probably be subpoenaed to testify.  Provide copies of the log and video tape to the city attorney and/or police; bring the originals with you to court.\n\nIf live in an area where there isn’t an ordinance, then it’s a civil matter.  You could take him to small claims, or talk it over with your attorney to see if you’re due a larger settlement (probably not).\n\nUnderstand if the neighbor doesn’t voluntarily curb the dog's barking and gets questioned by police, taken to court, fined, and so on, he’s going to be angry and may retaliate.  Be prepared in the event that he does.\n\nSo sorry to hear of another person going through this.  Best of luck."

This molecule carries the energy to the respiratory chain system, where three ATP molecules are energized from each one."

The product of a nucleophilic addition produces a carbocation attached by a single bond in the case of alkenes, and by a double bond in the case of alkynes. The vinyl cation from addition to alkynes is much higher in energy than the alkane cation from addition to the corresponding alkene, so in that sense, addition would seem to be slower to an alkyne. However, there is evidence to suggest some sort of cyclic addition in the case of alkynes, which complicates the picture. Add to that the effect of solvent and other reaction conditions, and it should be clear that there is no simple answer to your question."

"1","Love your enemy? Matt 5:43-44?","Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.1 Peter 5:8\n\nSo, we must love the devil?\n\nWhy can't god just make peace with the devil?\n\nWhy preach love and forgiveness when you yourself cannot live up to the standards you set.\n\nJesus said be perfect, like God is perfect.\n\nGod can't forgive his own enemy but wants us to forgive our enemy.\n\n\nWhat is up with this religion?","Jesus Christ said: “You heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.”—Matthew 5:43, 44.\n\nIt was the oral tradition of the Jews that held that ‘hating an enemy’ was the right thing to do. Jesus, however, said we must love our enemy, not just our friend. This is difficult but not impossible. Loving an enemy does not mean liking all his ways or his deeds. The Greek word found in Matthew’s account is derived from a·ga′pe, which describes a love that acts in harmony with principle. The person who manifests a·ga′pe, principled love, does good even to an enemy who hates and mistreats him. Why? Because it is the way to imitate Christ, and it is the way to conquer hatred. One Greek scholar noted: “[A·ga′pe] enables us to conquer our natural tendency to anger and to bitterness.” \n\nThe Christian, by contrast, is under obligation to love his enemies, that is, those who make themselves personal enemies. Such love (Gr., a·ga′pe) is not sentimentality, based on mere personal attachment, as is usually thought of, but is a moral or social love based on deliberate assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty, and propriety, sincerely seeking the other’s good according to what is right. A·ga′pe (love) transcends personal enmities, never allowing these to cause one to abandon right principles and to retaliate in kind. As to those who oppose his Christian course and persecute him, doing so in ignorance, the servant of God will even pray for such that their eyes might be opened to see the truth concerning God and His purposes.—Mt 5:44."

We do a lot of things together or with other friends.  We've been great friends & get along perfectly. We've both been single the course of knowing each other. I love everything about him, humor, sensitivity, brawn, everything he's a perfect match for me & I feel I'm the same for him.  I recently expressed how my feelings have grown & I'd like to be in a sexual/intimate & monogomous relationship with him...he has pushed me away yet has expressed that he feels the same. So the issue: He is HIV+ and I am HIV-.  He is afraid, I am not, I believe in romance, love, etc & feel that this is the man I want to take a chance & spend my life with. I know we can have a healthy safe relationship regardless of our different status. I know he feels for me.  Should I just stay friends, say goodbye or show him I'm there for the long haul good or bad and how?","Wow, Heavy!! You sound very wise for a 25 yr old. Ooops a stereotype. Sorry. Well, I have to agree on this-do not even worry about the age difference, it is not the issue and that will certainly pass if it is.  \n\nI commend you on your ability to wanting to stay through the ""long haul"", just be sure you have the strength for it.  I have a feeling this guy really cares for you and is probably having a difficult time right now depending on how long he has been HIV+. It is great that he cares for you and your health, but in my opinion one should never miss the opportunity to have a real love in their life in spite of an illness, disease, race or the rejection of society because of male/male or female/female.  To live a life in fear is a life half lived. Ask yourself how strong you really feel this bond is between you and stick with it.\n\nHelp him through his fears. Do not be afraid to make the HIV the center issue, because he will soon realize that you are truly there for him and vice vesa. Find information for him on HIV+ and HIV- couples from health advisors, clinics or the internet. Uunderstand that you can maintain a healthy safe, free from infection sexual and loving relationship.  You are his friend too, so don't give up on him.  Educate yourself and him everything will fall into place the more educated you both are.\n\nI know many long lasting HIV+ and HIV - couples, strght and gay.  I have a friend whose husband had his sperm washed so they could have a child and have a beautiful daughter from it-so it can work. I think your guy friend does not have all the resources to him or has not looked into them.  You sound like a real catch and the way you worded him he is one too-best of luck and go for the ""long haul' and since you believe in God pray for guidance your strength will be there."

"2","why drill pipe always get magnetised after getting out from downhole?","","It has to do with the alignment of charge due to unidirectional striking force- The same thing will happen to any iron bar after a hard strike-the force generated causes (usually temporary) alignment of enough atoms to generate magnetism. In a normal bar of iron, the atoms are aligned more or less at random, so there is no cumulative directional magnetic force- Any time a significantly large proportion of atoms are aligned together, the summation of the electromagnetic charges can be detected.  Rotating a piece of metal will not induce magnetic charge.  Exposing iron to an extremely powerful magnetic field will, because it will cause alignment of the atoms in the iron, but the magnetic field of the Earth (inside, outside, everywhere) is extremely weak."

"2","WHAT IS EVOLUTION? what are some misconceptions of Darwins ideas.?","","http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat01.html#Q01\nBiological evolution refers to the cumulative changes that occur in a population over time. These changes are produced at the genetic level as organisms' genes mutate and/or recombine in different ways during reproduction and are passed on to future generations. Sometimes, individuals inherit new characteristics that give them a survival and reproductive advantage in their local environments; these characteristics tend to increase in frequency in the population, while those that are disadvantageous decrease in frequency. This process of differential survival and reproduction is known as natural selection.\n\nMisconception 1:  According to the theory of natural evolution, experts are hard pressed to explain why homo sapiens walked erect.  One theory was that because the forest died and the area was covered with tall grass, homo sapiens have got to stand upright in order to see danger ahead.  Problem was why other apes were able to withdraw to the remaining forests and survived to these days?  Early human stood at an ungainly upright manner losing it dexterity whilst other apes are happily swinging through the trees.\n\nMisconception 2:  Early apes were largely vegetarians.  These are healthy food and easily available and the guts were built for digesting them.  Why change to an unhealthy and difficult to get diet of meats?  On top of that, their guts weren’t built for them.  \n\nMisconception 3:  Early apes have a coat of fur.  This is a wonderful covering, it kept the body warm in cold weather and well ventilated in warm weather.  In the wild, it is self-cleaning.  Why the specie of apes called homo sapiens chose to go naked?  He now has to invent clothing and air conditioner.\n\nMisconception 4:  Tongues are for talking, why other apes and animals don’t need to talk?  In fact, homo sapiens invented speeches.  Look at the multitude of languages and misunderstanding as a result. These lead to endless wars."

"2","How do I effectively stop heat from transferring between two bodies of matter?","For a school science project I need to be able to design and create a wetsuit.  However, I do not fully understand how a wetsuit works, or how it could be improved.","whoissarthak's idea works, but that isn't a wet suit; that's a dry suit.  A wet suit works differently.  The idea is that there are basically three ways to move heat: conduction, radiation, and convection.  Conduction is when two things are in direct contact, like touching a hot stove or a cold flagpole.  Radiation has to do with the infrared light emited by warm bodies, and has nothing much to do with your project.  Convection is the real concern--it is the transfer of heat by means of a fluid intermediate, and it is the fast form of heat loss.\n\nYou're body sheds heat by means of perspiration, where sweat evaporates and takes heat away with it--that's convection.  When you fell colder in a strong breexe, that's convection taking heat away quicker.  When you blow on a spoon of hot soup to cool it, that's convection.\n\nThe way a wetsuit works is by not allowing the water in contact with the skin to be carried away.  It inhibits the movement of water through it.  Enough gets in to contact the skin and make your skin wet, which is why they call it a wetsuit, but that water doesn't leave easily.  It stays put and your body heats up the water.  Hence, the water in your wetsuit is much warmer than the water in the surrounding ocean, so the water taking heat from your skin is not quickly carried away and replaced by more cold water.\n\nIf you want to make a wetsuit, you want something htat will make it difficult (but not impossible) for water to come and go."

A friend of mine and I were recently talking about racism. The irony of this is the fact that he is white, gay, republican and a reformed racist. (At my insistance, well at least that's what he tells me.) He had a very hard time being my friend because he was raised to believe that all black people were, well you know the n-word and all the negative connotations therein. He admitted it, yes he was raised that way by his father. The same man who abused and hurt him taught him to hate people of color. They moved way out into a rural area just to get away from minorities. Sad, but true. \n\nWell anyway, he told me that racism hasn't gone anywhere. (I kind of already knew that.) He said that it has just become no longer politically correct or socially acceptable to behave in a racist fashion in public. He told me that people still use the ""N-word"" when no one is around, and that the things that ""the man"" does to keep the black man down have become more sophisticated. This is true. Why is it that African American infants have the highest infant mortality rate in a modernized country? 9.3 infant deaths per 1,000 births. \n\nThe answer to why people discriminate against African Americans and Puerto Ricans is simple. Someone has to be at the bottom, in order for there to be a top. Eventually, money will be the factor that separates us. It will be the rich and the poor. But in the meantime it will be color, because as I have stated time and time again, people of color will never assimilate into the mainstream culture."

Nonvascular plants are bryophytes, the most primitive land-dwelling plantsm, and lack the adaptations to transport water and nutrients against gravity (lignin-impregnated conducting cells).\nVascular plants are, evolutionarily speaking, more recent, and contain xylem and phloem, the lignin-impregnated conducting cells which provide a rigid upright support structure and which transport water and nutrients throughout the plant. Xylem is the ""woody"" part of vascular plants, and transports sap up from the roots, while phloem transports nutrients throughout the plant."
"1","Which foreign language should I learn?","I love Sanskrit, Hindi, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Spanish, and a lot of other languages.  I wish I could learn them all.  I buy a program for learning one, but then find a program for another and buy it too, so I don't concentrate on one, just learning tidbits of each.  Which one do you think I should concentrate on learning, and what reasons do you have for your suggestion?","I think there's nothing wrong with learning a little bit of many different languages like you are doing now.  If you feel the need to concentrate on one, I recommend that you consider which languages are most available to you for learning (such as which ones are most convenient for you to take classes in, for example) and which ones you feel will be most useful to you in the future (such as with future boyfriends/girlfriends or in your future profession).\n\nIn addition, why restrict yourself to focusing on just one?  After you work on one new language for a while and you feel that your communicative needs are met, why not learn more?  Knowing more languages is its own reward, IMHO."

If your cat had a thyroid problem, then radioactive iodine 131 was used to kill thyroid tissue, because the thyroid selectively collects iodine.  As a previous poster said, by the time you can get to a doctor, you're already going to absorb all you're probably going to get from this exposure, because iodine 131 has a half life of about a half an hour, so by the time three hours have passed, it's all decayed away to normal iodine.  The reason you found potassion iodide listed as a treatment is that if you take a tablet, it floods your system with more iodine than your thyroid can handle, and it won't accept any more; assuming you take it BEFORE or IMMEDIATELY after your exposure to radioactive iodine, it prevents your body from absorbing the radioactive stuff and it just flushes right out of your system.  \n\nIf, however, your cat was treated with something other than iodine, whatever isotope was used may have other effects on you (strontium deposits in bone, for instance, replacing calcium)  Only way to know for sure is to figure out what the treatment was and ask your doctor for advice.  It is probably nothing to worry about, but worth checking with a medical professional just to be sure."

Thanks very much.","When you are computing the probability of a given event such as 2 heads, 2 tails, or one of each, you are essentially counting the number of ways a given event can occur and dividing this number by the number of all possible outcomes.\n\nIf you toss 2 coins once ( or one coin twice) there are 4 possible outcomes:\n\nHH = both heads\nHT = 1st heads, 2nd tails\nTH = 1st tails, 2nd heads\nTT = both tails\n\nAssuming the coins are ""fair"" each outcome is equally likely.\n\nThere is one way in four that two heads (or 2 tails) can happen so the probability for each of these outcomes is 1/4\nBut there are two ways you can have one head and one tail and so the probability of this happening is 2/4 =1/2. The sum of all the probabilities of the distinct outcomes will always equal 1. \n1/4 +1/4 + 1/2 =1\n\nHow about if you have 3 tosses? The 8 possible outcomes are as follows:\n\nHHH \nHHT\nHTH\nTHH\nHTT\nTHT\nTTH\nTTT\nWe see there is only one way to have 3 heads (or 3 tails) and so the probability of 3 heads (or 3 tails) = 1/8\nHowever there are 3 ways you can have 2 heads and one tail, so the probability of this happening is 3/8.

"1","What is the origin of the phoenix(bird), raising from the ashes?","","In ancient Egyptian mythology and in myths derived from it, the phoenix is a mythical sacred firebird.\n\nSaid to live for 500, 1461 or for 12594 years (depending on the source), the phoenix is a male bird with beautiful gold and red plumage. At the end of its life-cycle the phoenix builds itself a nest of cinnamon twigs that it then ignites; both nest and bird burn fiercely and are reduced to ashes, from which a new, young phoenix arises. The new phoenix embalms the ashes of the old phoenix in an egg made of myrrh and deposits it in Heliopolis (""the city of the sun"" in Greek), located in Egypt. The bird was also said to regenerate when hurt or wounded by a foe, thus being almost immortal and invincible — a symbol of fire and divinity.\n\nOriginally, the phoenix was identified by the Egyptians as a stork or heron-like bird called a benu, (see Bennu), known from the Book of the Dead and other Egyptian texts as one of the sacred symbols of worship at Heliopolis, closely associated with the rising sun and the Egyptian sun-god Ra.\nOne inspiration that has been suggested for the Egyptian phoenix is a specific bird species of East Africa. This bird nests on salt flats that are too hot for its eggs or chicks to survive; it builds a mound several inches tall and large enough to support its egg, which it lays in that marginally cooler location. The convection currents around these mounds resembles the turbulence of a flame."

To answer your questions??","The Bible talks about people like you... who will hear but not hear... see but not see... \n\nIn Isaiah 11:12 The point you brought up about the world not having corners...  : )\nFunny that you say that... Let me EXPLAIN... \nJudah would soon be exiled to Babylon, and a remnant would return to Jerusalem in 537 B.C. In ages to come.  However, God's peple would be dispersed throughout the world.  These cities represent the FOUR CORNERS of the known world-Hamath in the North, Egypt in the Sounth, Assyria and Babylonia in the East, the islands of the sea in the West.  Ultimately God's people will be regathered when Christ comes to reign over the earth.  Therefore those cities would no longer be.  That is what that scripture means... I will elaborate the other scripture beneath this one...","I love you...  : )"

"1","does anyone really believe that dreams are things of the future or just things in our minds?","are dreams things that happened to us during the day we had the dream, things we thought about that day, things we wanted to happen or windows into the future?","I believe that dreams serve multiple purposes. The greatest being a doorway to other realms. I don't mean that in a hoaky / spacy way. I mean that as ,quite lterally, being in touch with spirits that may visit you while you're sleeping because of your receptiveness during sleep. I mean that as your own ability to tap into the deeper parts of yourself that already have answers stored there for your withdrawal, most people simply don't believe there is a place within themselves that can provide truth beyond what they understand in reality. If you wrap your head around that notion... these answers become available to you. Whether that be through futuristic prophecies, understanding your souls past, or understanding who you are today and why. I think life is all about understanding yourself and re-membering with your past. Dreams are a large part of how this happens. There is a difference between a spiritual dream and your mind taking out the days trash..though I suspect you can probably dechipher between the two. To answer your question simply... dreams serve all of the purposes you mentioned. Your job is to sort out what types of dreams you're having and interpret them appropriately. A dream log would do you wonders, write in it as soon as you wake up. There will be times when you think you didn't have a dream but if you lay in bed for a few minutes usually something will come to you. It takes time to train your mind  to remember these first words as soon as you wake - ""What was I dreaming?"" \nHope this answers your question!"

Plus if you have children who need daycare, you end up working to pay the babysitter. It's a shame b/c continuing their education would get them a better job but either they don't think of it that way or they're lazy and don't want to try.

Glucose of course has Calories...","The simple answer is that 1g of SPLENDA contains a fraction of a calorie, so they round down to get 0 calories.\n\nThough you might have heard anything ending in ""ose"" means sugar and should be used in moderation, sucralose, the sweetening ingredient in SPLENDA, is not recognized by the body as sugar or as a carbohydrate and has no calories. Sucralose has also been shown not to cause a rise in hemoglobin A1c (a measure of your average blood glucose level over time).\n\nSPLENDA can lower carbohydrates and calories in recipes. For example, a cup of SPLENDA has 96 calories and 24 grams of carbohydrates, compared to the 770 calories and 192 grams of carbohydrates found in a cup of sugar."

Yet it is accepted as fact by many within the scientific community and elsewhere.\n\nBased on our current technological capabilities and observations of the universe we have no business asking science this type of question.

"1","When do you hand out religious pamphlets?","Twice now at work I have had customers hand me born again Baptist pamphlets at work. I'm a cashier so basically, I ring these people up, they pay and then they hand me a pamphlet. There is nothing about my appearance, demeanor or manner of dress at work that screams ""SINNER"" as far as I'm aware. In fact, there is no way that they could be sure, not knowing me at all, that I am not a born again Baptist. Yet no one else at my work has been handed a pamphlet on the job. So my question is this, to anyone out there who hands out religious pamphlets: do you carry a lot with you and hand them out to any convenient person, or do you only carry a few and pick out people that seem like godless heathens based on appearance?","Hmm...are you the only cashier in the place?  If so, you are the most accessible employee there, the one with the most customer contact.\n\nI do something similar.  I used to hand out tracts from the American Bible Society, when they used to have tracts with little or no commentary, just pure Scripture.  I'd hand them out at events like parades or protests or with my Halloween treats for trick-or-treaters.  Unfortunately ABS was taken over by interests that turned ABS into just another conservative-run Christian outfit, and they no longer make those commentary-free tracts.\n\nA couple of times I've written and produced my own tracts.  When I discovered Vistaprint.com, I started ordering business cards that quote Scripture and point to my websites.  I hand out such cards to cashiers, bus drivers, token booth clerks, etc.  It doesn't matter to me what they look like.  We are all sinners, and we all need God.  I also include my cards in some mailings, and sometimes include them with greeting cards, or leave them at the ATM area of my bank, on the counter.  Oh, yeah, at parades and protest and Halloween treats and such.\n\nAll that said, it's possible that your tract-givers are of the ilk that hand out their materials only to those ""sinners"" they think really need them.  Maybe something about your appearance moves them to do this.  If so, I apologize to your for their bigotted behavior.  Please don't judge Jesus by them."

For details, please see that answer.  \n\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Am9iPSwhQW.CBlEttT2gKzwjzKIX?qid=1006021203731","Koran recognizes Jews and their prophet, Mosa as well as Christians and their prophet Jesus. Koran also recognizes that Jerusalem is the Holy Land of Jews. But this can't interpreted as a deed of ownership. \n\nJews always try to distort it by purpose in order to make Moslims to serve them for the establishment of Big Israel State between two rivers, exactly like how they convince Christians that it is a Christian duty to support Jews cause they are chosen, etc.\n\nMoslims are not taught to be hate Jews. Moslims respect them and the fact that Jerusalem is their Holy Land. Their greedy unrealistic Big Israel Utopia which is covering whole Middle East and their violance in Palestine make Moslims hate them. \n\nSee, we respect them, their Holy Land, but as usual, it is not enough, they ask for the deed of ownership. \n\n\n[62-6,7,8] : Say (O Muhammad): O ye who are Jews, if ye claim that ye are the favoured of Allah apart from (all) mankind, then long for death if you are truthful.

They became enticed with sin, and sinful desires.\n\n""There were giants (Hebrew: Nephilim) in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the Sons of God (angels) came unto the daughters of men (humans) and they bare children to them,the mutant offspring were giants, physically and mentally superior to humans, yet they were brutish, sensual, violent and immoral, and they were all males. \n\nGenesis 1-6.

Your microwave safe thermometer probably has a minute amount of water in it, so it will itself get hot and give a false reading. (like a bowl gets hotter than the food in it!)\n\n2.  If the thermometer does read correctly, it might see a slight temp increase from the fan, lights, and magnetron operation.\n\n3.  The walls of the oven may have some water and they will heat up causing a slight temperature increase.\n\nI would expect to see a little temperature increase, but nothing like a traditional electric or gas fired oven."

"1","Communism..Why is and was it vilified and considered evil??","If communism is a pure state where all are equal financially and culturally, why consider it evil?? Is it not merely the desire of certain elite individuals to consider themselves more equal than others that caused the system to fail?? What would be wrong with equal medical and social systems for all??","Think about it for a moment. The core concept of Comunism is that all are equal right?  For all to be equal that means you must bring everybody down to the lowest common denominator. How else can such equality be achieved?  You can only bring certain people up to a certain level. There are inherent physical limits that all people are born with. Some may be good at one thing or another. To equalize people is to bring them down to what the weakest link is capable of. In effect you make the whole chain as strong as the weakest link. \n\nLets look at Comunism on a grand scale. In a pure Commie society you have each person assigned to what is judged to be their best place to contribute to society. On the top it sounds great right? Of course everybody assumes they'll get one of the good jobs. Most jobs suck. So most people will get stuck doing something they hate. If you take it to it's literal ends, then all good jobs would be removed because by deffinition they set somebody up as elite. Astronauts, musicians, atheletes, and so on. By being made one of those they are instantly made elite.  In reality many of these jobs are necessary to the functioning of society. So the absolute ideal is literally impossible.  Not everybody is capable of singing.  To make somebody who can sing like an Angel tote garbage while forcing a tone deaf person to do vocals is a bigger injustice than creating an elite because of an innate ability they are born with.  Not everybody can be a rocket scientist or a skilled surgeon. Would you honestly want randomly chosen people to be your doctor if your life was on the line? \n\nSo even with the best intents Comunism does and by necessity has to put people up as elite.  Instead of people choosing their field and putting their talents out there for the general public to judge relitive talent another group of elites judge. You have to have somebody to decide who does what. Who allocate resources and people to tasks. I guess technically today you could use computers  to do that with standardized testing. However what about subjective areas such as art? How can a computer judge that?  Or do you do away with arts all together? \n\nNext comes the biggest hidden injustice of all socialisms. The very core ideal of socialism of any sort relies on each person carrying out the collective will.  For it to work each person MUST work inside the collective will.  By deffinition every dissenter, every person who does not abide by the collective will damages the collective. They reduce the already margional tolerances the society has for survival. Dissenters are a threat to the survival of a collective society. If any large movement starts the collective will collapses. For it to exist the collective MUST have almost unanimous support. Each person must strive to carry out their part of the collective efforts. If the shoemakers for example dissent, then everybody goes without shoes. If the farmers do not pull their share of the work, then everybody starves. So every person must do their assigned work to the best of their ability. \n\nNow think about that for a moment. Try to picture getting 100 of even like minded people to agree completely on even the implementation of a goal they all want. I've never seen it happen. There has always been egos, power plays, disagreements over methods, laziness, poor judgement, emotionalism, favortism and a hundred other very human things which interfere with the collective. It's natural. It is to be human to dissent. To feel that your own opinion and worth is greater than others. \n\nAs a result, the collective to survive must prevent dissent. They must curtail any actions which prevent people from doing anything but their best for the collective. All must volentarily bow to the collective will or the collective will becomes a tyranny. Since you cannot get functional humans to lose such things as ego, subjective emotions such as taste, opinion and belief. Then such traits must b"

Originally it was an accidental hybrid between S. maritima and the closely related S. alterniflora and incapable of producing seeds, but capable of spreading by vegetative means. A mutation allowed S. anglica to begin producing viable seeds, but it does not hybridize with either S. maritima or S. alterniflora due to chromasome doubling. This species normally out-competes other cord grasses, so it would be difficult to maintain the position that this is some sort of ""slow decline in species"" as it is a prime example of survival of the fittest and there is some concern it will lead to the extinction of some of the species that were it's ancestors."

"1","Why do Jewish people put small stones on the tombstones when they visit the cemetary?","I noticed this in Schindler's List, and on tv since then.  I was just wondering...","According to Rabbi Maurice Lamm (author of ""The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning"") the custom of placing stones on the monument ""probably serves as a reminder of the family's presence. [The evidence that this grave is attended, visited and cared for, is respectful for the deceased - NS]. Also, it may hark back to biblical days when the monument was a heap of stones. Often the elements or roving vandals dispersed them, and so visitors placed other additional stones to assure that the grave was marked.""\n\n\n\nAlso, by placing a stone we further participate in the ""construction"" of the tombstone -- which in itself constitutes a mitzvah.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, it is not a Chabad custom to place stones on tombstones"

How many pizza combinations can I have if the minimum toppings on the pizza is 3?  Or if you have 30 players how many combinations of 5 can you have?  \n\nCan someone help out here?","Suppose the number of combinations of k objects out of n objects without respect to order chosen is C(n, k). If we wanted to count order, we would multiply each combination by the number of ways it could be permuted. Thus P(k)*C(n, k) is the number of ways one could choose k people out of n people with regard to order. \nBut we can easily count this number another way. The number of possible choices for the first person is n, for the second person n-1, and so on until we reach n - k + 1. Thus, we get the equation P(k)*C(n, k) = P(n, k) = n*(n - 1)*...*(n - k + 1) = n!/(n - k)!. Solving for C(n, k), we get C(n, k) = n!/[P(k)(n - k)!] = n!/[k!(n - k)!]. \nNow you should be able to derive it whenever you get confused."
"1","Could Xena and Gabrielle (From Xena Warrior Princess) be based on these characters in mythology?","""Do you Agree that Xena could be based on these characters from Greek mythology:\n> Bellona - roman goddess of war,\n> Atalanta - huntress and athlete,\n> Diana - goddess of the moon and a huntress,\n> Artemis - the virgin huntress - but only the huntress part applies to\n> Xena.\n> Themis - goddess of law and justice.\n> Nemesis - goddess of retribution.\n> Nike (Victoria) - goddess of victory.\n> Penthesilea - Queen of the Amazons.\n> There was a Goddess called Polyxena - she was put to death by Achilles\n> ghost.\n\nI got that info from the link below\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.tv/msg/a5a78c34910d75a8?q=achilles+greek+mythology&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&rnum=41\n\nCould she also be based on this charater:\nIxion is a fundamental character in Greek mythology. The most complete account of Ixion's tale comes from Pindar in his Pythian Odes. Ixion was the son the Phlegyas, descendent of Ares, and king of the Lapiths in Thessaly. He is significant in many respects, but is chiefly known as the first human to shed kindred blood. This occurred when Ixion invited his father-in-law, Deioneus, to come and collect the price that Ixion owed him for his bride. Upon his arrival, Deioneus fell into a pit filled with burning coals Ixion had camouflaged.\n\nBecause this was a crime new to the human race, nobody could purify Ixion and he wandered an exile. Zeus took pity on him and decided not only to purify Ixion, but to invite him to Olympus as a guest. Once in Olympus though, Ixion became so enamored of Hera, and he desired to sleep with her. Zeus did not believe that Ixion would be so disrespectful as to have designs upon the wife of his host. To see if the rumors were true, Zeus made an image of Hera out of a cloud, and impregnated it. The cloud bore Ixion the monster Centaurus, who was unloved by the Graces and had no honor among men or the gods. Centaurus then mated with the mares of Mt. Pelion in Magnesia, and so from Ixion the race of centaurs was born.\n\nTo punish him, Zeus bound Ixion to a winged (sometimes flaming) wheel, which revolved in the air in all directions. Also, by order of the gods, Ixion was forced to call out continuously call out: ""You should show gratitude to your benefactor."" Ixion became one of the more famous sinners on display on Tartarus, and most writers mention him when describing the place. For example, Ovid wrote of him, and Vergil, with his moralistic interpretation of how sin should be punished, awards Ixion a special mention in the Aenead.\n\nThe focus of Ixion's mythology on the guest/host relationship shows the venerable age of Ixion's story. Of all the attributes Zeus became associated with, he was originally particularly worried that the custom of Xenia, the formal institution of friendship that ensured traveling archaic Greeks could count on each other for safety in antiquity, be enforced (for more on this in all the Greek world see Powell 150; the importance of the guest/host relationship is fundamental to all world mythology, take the Biblical story of Sodom and Gommorah, for example).\n\nAeschylus remembered Ixion's role as the purified progenitor of blood guilt in the Euminides. Athena, before she will hear Orestes' case refers to him as Ixion, an allusion Orestes balks at and tries to convince her is false (Euminides. 450-455).\n\nPirithous, king of the Lapiths, good friend of Theseus, and important in later myth, is considered to be one of Ixion's children. There is another claimant to Pirithous' paternity though. Zeus, in the Iliad 14. 317-318, claims to have seduced Dia, Ixion's wife, and fathered Pirithous.\n\nI got that info from this link: http://www.pantheon.org/articles/i/ixion.html\n\nXena could be based on that character because the name sounds simalar.\n\nCould Gabrielle be based on this character:\nThere is only one character from myth, fable, or history that relates to Gabrielle, Xena's fa","the characters are based on Greek mythology"

"2","How can an artificial sweetener contain no calories?","","Artificial sweeteners activate the ""sweet"" areas of our taste buds, but do not have caloric content because they are not digested by the body for energy.\n\nThe human body is very specific about the stereochemistry of the compounds it recognizes and uses for ""food"".  Many, if not most nutrients have stereoisomers -- the chemical can be seen to be right-handed or left-handed.   IIRC, the chemicals that can be used for food by the human body are generally the ""left-handed"" stereoisomer.  This is the secret behind Splenda -- the new sugar substitute.  It is exactly the same chemical composition as sucrose, but in the right-handed configuration.  So the body cannont digest it, and therefore it is sweet without containing any useable calories."

"1","White minority?","Is it possible for a white person to be considered a minority? lets say a white person lives in an all black neighborhood (like the south side of chicago) and they never see anyone else but black people. would they be considered a minority? Has anyone ever been considered a minority like this?","Sure, white people can be considered a minority; it just depends on the scale you're looking at.  If you're talking about the United States, you will never hear white people referred to as a minority category, even though I think I recently heard they have fallen below 50% of the population; it's just that no other ethnic group has a greater percentage.  But if you're looking at a neighborhood, or even a city or state, it is quite possible for white people to be the minority.  I'm white, and I used to live in Harlem, so I was definitely a minority.  I got called ""whitey"" quite often... but then maybe I asked for it, as I was training for long-distance road races at the time, running through Harlem in really short shorts and no shirt!  Anyway, I think it's a valuable experience for everyone to be put in the position of being a visible minority at least once in their life."

(for instance there would be:  x (times) -(negative) 1/2 infront of (1) (maybe not in this question but just for instance) or -1. ( I think you have to multiply by -1 if there is nothing to change?) am i on the right track?\n\nMuch apprecitated:)))","Multiply the first equation by -1.  In practice you will bring the right to the left and send the left to the right.

If the object is always moving at right angles to the force, there is no change in kinetic energy.\n\nThe most obvious example is a planet in a circular orbit around a star.  The star exerts a constant force on the planet, but the planet's kinetic energy never changes because the force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion.\n\nThis is a case where a non-zero net force results in no change in kinetic energy."

It's important to know what animals eat the seeds or fruits of flowering trees to deduce it's role in a given ecosystem.

Thank you...","The pure and applied science can be differentiated as:\nPure science - motivated by curiosity \nApplied science - designed to answer specific questions. \n\nGiven these definitions, I will later argue that governments have a special responsibility to fund basic science while applied science can generally be left to industry. The distinction is, of course, not always entirely clear cut, and the term ""strategic research"" is sometimes used to describe science in an intermediate category which appears to have a good chance of applications even if it is done to satisfy curiosity, and is leading to new fundamental understandings. An example is research on the properties of two-dimensional semiconductors.\n\nThe difference between pure, and applied science was beautifully illustrated by J.J. Thomson - the discoverer of the electron - in a speech delivered in 1916 :\n\n""By research in pure science I mean research made without any idea of application to industrial matters but solely with the view of extending our knowledge of the Laws of Nature. I will give just one example of the ""utility"" of this kind of research, one that has been brought into great prominence by the War - I mean the use of X-rays in surgery......Now how was this method discovered? It was not the result of a research in applied science starting to find an improved method of locating bullet wounds. This might have led to improved probes, but we cannot imagine it leading to the discovery of the X-rays. No, this method is due to an investigation in pure science, made with the object of discovering what is the nature of Electricity."""

"1","Fellow Christians (or anyone) What are your views on the origin of the world and people?","this is basically Creationism vs. Evolution","think about the eye.  it's no good if all you have is an eyeball, yet lack an optic nerve to transmit the light as an electric signal, or an occipital cortex to interpret the electric pulses back into a picture.\n\nso how could the eye have evolved?  suppose some primordial worm starts getting two black dots on its head that will eventually turn into eyes.  suppose they eventually turn into eyes.  he still can't see.  this is not a viable mutation as it has no possible survival value or advantage over the other plain ol' worms.  an eye is no good unless every other part of the visual system is already intact.\n\nso a gradual evolving a pair of eyes won't work, since it will hinder the creature's survival before it will actually help it out.  the only way natural selection favours evolutionary andvancements is through ''hopeful monsters.'' a lizard hatching a bird, a worm with no eyes giving rise to one with eyes in a single generation.\n\nand that's another thing.  what if a lizard tried to grow longer and longer scales in hopes that they'd one day become feathers?  well, there comes a point where this lizard has half feather/scales, on some rather cumbersome, yet extremely fragile wing-like ''hands,'' which it can no longer use for running from predators, yet, it still cannot fly.  natural selection would quickly weed out such a transitional creature.\n\nand that's another thing...where are all these transitional fossils that had to be here?  since evolution took place over millions and millions of years, right?  (the earth's age is actually closer to what the bible says, anyway, as the speed of light is slowing down, and used to be much much faster in the past, according to modern quantum physics and other considerations, [see sources] so radioactive decay used to be much faster in the past, making radio-carbon dating yeild ages far too old)....there actually wasn't even enough time for things to evolve.  the only way evolution could've happened was by hopeful monsters...\n\nwhat about the peppered moth, mike?  what about it?  there's a variation in the species.  what about red heads and brunettes? ;-)  okay, what about the tiny 18 inch tall horses in fossil records?  well, modern, wild brown horses can be selectively bred to get tiny little horses like that.  yes, it takes about 80 years, but it can be done.  (evolutionists tend to call this ''micro-evolution'' just to get a foothold ;-)  )  what's more, regular house cats have been successfully bred with lions to produce ''medium sized'' cats.  this only shows that there is a wide variance in the species, but it's still one kind.  evolution states that one species will change so much over a period of time that it cannot breed with other species that have branched off in different directions."

We need to apply 230 degrees celcius of heat for heating air and ammonia). So, here's the reaction equation for that:\n\n4NH3(g)  +  5O2(g)  --->  4NO(g)  +  6H20(l)\n\nWe've got our Nitrogen monoxide now..so let's move on..\n\n\nSTAGE 3: Converting Nitrogen Monoxide into Nitric Acid\n\nIn this reaction we are going to react Nitrogen Monoxide with Oxygen and Steam to obtain Nitric Acid like this:\n\n4NO(g) + 3O2(g) + 2H2O(g) ---> 4NO3(aq)\n\nSTAGE 4: Converting this Nitric Acid into Ammonium Nitrate\n\nSo, Now nitric acid is going to be reacted with Ammonia (from Haber Process again..) in an addition reaction. Ammonium Nitrate in this case, will be our fertilizer..So, this is the final stage.. <Phweks!!> Here we go:\n\nNH2(g)  +  HNO3(aq)  --->  NH4NO3(aq)\nAmmonia gas + Nitric Acid ---> Ammonium Nitrate!!!\n\n\nUses:\nThe ions these fertilizers contain enrichen the soil very much..Ions like the nitrates and phosphates are absorbed by the plants through osmosis from the soil..These ions then help the plant in various stuff like synthesising the chlorophyll molecule..some like nitrates are converted into plant proteins...\n\nOk, I guess I have exhausted everything I know about fertilizers...\n\nI really hope it was of some help for u...   :)"

I looked a mobile hanging motionless, and said, ""If there is anyone else here, make the mobile spin."" The next moment, the mobile began to spin.\n\nOne time I was driving into Ponca State Park to set up a large camping gathering, and the sides of the road were lined with spirits. All standing there, clearly visible to everyone, calmly welcoming us back.\n\nOn another camping trip, we felt a spirit near the bon-fire. We had a ring of 40 tiki-torches around the bonfire. It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired. The repairman asked if she'd been in a nuclear power plant. All the innards were fried from electromagnetism\n\nMy grandmother died while my niece was in utero. After my niece was born, she would look up at areas where no one was standing, and laugh and giggle. We all knew that she was looking at gramma, so we never showed her any pictures. Finally, at about a year old, she could speak, and my sister showed her the family photo album. My niece picked out her photo and said, ""That's Old Gramma."""
"2","Does the Earth's rotational speed affect the moon's orbital radius?","Another one of those high school physics things has come back to haunt me.  I seem to recall a teacher telling me there was a relationship between the Earth's rotation speed and the distance of the moon.  Something along the lines of if the moon were to drift farther away, it would have an effect on the Earth's rotation..  hence the length of our days.\n\nIs this true?  If it is, what is the name of the gravitational principle?","The name of the principle is conservation of angular momentum.\nL = Iw, where I is the moment of inertia of an object, and w is the angular velocity of the object.  L is the angular momentum of the object.\nThe angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system is L(net) = L(Earth) + L(Moon).  The Earth has a moment of inertia of [2/5]mr^2, and a certain angular velocity (m is the mass of the Earth, r is the radius of the earth).  The Moon has a moment of inertia of MR^2, where R is the orbital distance of the Moon from the Earth and M is the mass of the Moon.\nSo, L(net) = [2/5]mr^2 (w-Earth) + MR^2 (w-Moon), where w-Earth and w-Moon are the angular velocities of the two.\nIf w-Earth (the rotation speed of the Earth) were to go down, one of the other quantities would have to increase.  Since the mass and radius of the Earth are pretty much set, as is the mass of the Moon, it would have to be the orbital radius of the Moon or the angular velocity of the Moon that would need to increase.  The two are positively related, so they would both increase.\nOr, if the Moon were to randomly move farther away, the Earth's rotation would slow down, and our days would get longer."

Disbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods. b. The doctrine that there is no God or gods. 2. Godlessness; immorality.\n\nIn other words,\nthe agnostic doubts that God exists but leaves the finding of God open as a possibility (""gnosis"" knowing, seeing; ""a"" not)\n\nThe atheist denies that God exists (""a"" not; ""theo"" God).\n\nThis raises the question, ""How could we prove God?"" \n\nGod has no image, says the Bible. That is, with scientific means as practiced nowadays in a materialistic way, we will not be able to prove God!\n\nHowever, advanced logic may lead us to realize that their must a God, Creator of all things and in all things, as the Bible states.\n\nGood question.

"1","Has anyone converted to Catholicism from a Protestant background?","I do not want to hear about converting because of marriage or something where your heart wasn't in it. If it was other than this, why did you convert? Was it because you were dissatisfied with something in the Protestant services, you had a revelation that Catholicism was the truest form of Christianity, or something else. Please only those that converted out of heart felt reasons answer, and not those that were coerced or something and you could care less about Jesus. (like it seems so many are when it is Prot=>Cath) Please convince me otherwise.","I was born and raised Southern Baptist.  I never felt at home in that faith.  I always felt like an outsider looking in.  I went to church Sun morn, Sun eve and Wed eve every week without fail for my entire childhood.\n\nI graduated from high school and moved out on my own.  After a period of staying out of churchs completely, I felt empty in my heart.  After a lot of soul searching I figured out that the emptiness in my heart was due to my being out of the will of God.  In order to fill that emptiness I had to reconcile myself to God. \n\nI tried going back to the Baptist Church, but I still never felt like I was a part of that.  At the time I worked with two Catholics.  They had a peace about them that I wanted in my life!  They talked openly about being Catholic, they weren't ashamed of it.  And I could tell that being Catholic was a big part of their entire life--not just a trip to church twice on Sunday and once on Wednesday nite.\n\nSo I did some more research.  I liked what I read about the Catholic faith.  And I began to take instruction in the Catholic faith.  This has been one of the hardest things I've ever done in my whole life.  All my life as a Baptist I was taught that Catholics were going to hell because they worshipped Mary and the Saints.  That they prayed to statues.  That the Roman Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon mentioned in the Book of Revelation.  That you ask Jesus to forgive you, not a man---even if the man is a priest.  And so on and so forth, ad infinitum ad nauseum.\n\nIt took a lot of study and prayer to find the answers to all those bogus notions I'd been taught.  Catholics don't worship Mary or the Saints--we venerate them.  We don't pray to statues---that's just dumb.  I don't believe the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon.  Jesus gave the power to forgive sins and cast out demons in his Name to his disciples.  And its ok to confess your sins to a priest.  \n\nI took instruction for about six months.  I joined the Catholic Church about 25 years ago and I've never regretted a minute of it.  I finally feel at home in a church.  I'm active in my local Church--I help out at Mass and I teach in our Parish School of Religion.  \n\nI have a peace in my heart and soul that I never felt when I was Baptist.   And I still hear the same bone headed things that I heard as a kid about Catholics.\n\nHas this cost me anything?  Yes.  My father, a die-hard Baptist, never accepted my conversion.  Until his dying day he still would not talk about it.  That hurt a lot.\n\nBut I have a church home now--and a solid faith in my Lord Jesus--who saves me from my sinful nature by his Grace alone.  I can't earn my salvation--its a gift from the Lord.  \n\nWould I do it over again?  Yes---although I probably would've not drug my heels so much and made the conversion much sooner."

"2","Why are some people double jointed?","","Generally, double jointedness describes people who can stretch their joints further than 'normal'.\n\nCauses include: abnormally-shaped ends of one or more bones at a joint, weak or stretched ligaments, low muscle tone, abnormal joint proprioception (an impaired ability to determine where in space parts of the body are, and how stretched a joint is)\n\nSuch 'hypermobility' may not be indicative of any underlying medical conditions, and (natural) double jointedness is genetic in origin. Having said that, people who are double jointed can be prone to injury to the joints and muscle problems (since muscles have to stretch further with the movement of the joint)."

I was at a lunch celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Apollo/Soyuz mission. But I didn't get called on during the Q&A). rats.","The landing method may have something to do with the design shape. The American capsule landed in the ocean and a conical shape makes it float up-right. The occupants then had to wait in the capsule to be recovered. The Russian capsule lands on dry land and the occupants can immediately exit the vehicle and wait to be picked up, therefore, no need for the conical shape to remain up-right. Those reasons, along with differing design philosophies are probably the only reasons for the difference."

"2","My birthdate is totally prime numbers, does that make me special?","The year - 1957 (yes I'm that old) :)\nThe month - July - i.e. 7\nThe day - 23\n\nIn fact I can't remember of anyone I know who is born on a totally prime date. (Of course this question is more of a trivia than a math question! But I like this section better!))","There's a mistake in your question.  But I'm going to write this assuming your question is correct.  See the very end of my answer for an important point.\n\nWhether you're ""special"" depends on your definition of special, I guess.  It does put you in a fairly rare class of dates.\n\nLet's look at the likelihood of having a birthdate that matches your conditions.\n\n1) The year of your birth is a prime number.\n2) The month of your birth is a prime number.\n3) The day-of-the-month of your birth is a prime number.\n\nIn the past 100 years, there were only 13 years that were prime:  1907, 1913, 1931, 1933, 1949, 1951, 1973, 1979, 1987, 1993, 1997, 1999, and 2003.\n\nIn any given year, there are only five months that are prime:  2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nAnd in a given month, there are only eleven possible days that are prime, though not all of these occur in every month:  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31.\n\nLet's calculate how many total days there were in the past 100 years, and how many of those dates meet your criteria.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the total number of days in the past 100 years, ignoring leap years (we'll add those in later).  Every year has 365 days, so 365 times 100 equals 36,500.\n\nNow, let's add in the leap years.  Leap years come every 4 years, except that if a year is divisible by 100, it's not a leap year.  Except if it's divisble by 400, it is a leap year.  The only ""exceptional"" year in the past 100 years is the year 2000, and that's divisible by 400, so it was a leap year.  So there were twenty-five leap years over the past 100 years (the period from April 22, 1906 through April 21, 2006).\n\nSo the total number of days in the past 100 years is 36,525.\n\nNow, how many of those dates fit your criteria?\n\nIn a non-leap year, there are 52 dates that fit your criteria.  All leap years are divisible by four, and thus they are not prime numbers, so we can completely ignore leap years in this calculation.  The dates are:\n\nFebruary 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23\nMarch 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31\nMay 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31\nJuly 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31\nNovember 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n\nAdd them up, and you'll see there are 52 of them.  52 dates per year, multiplied by thirteen years that are prime comes out to 676.\n\nSo out of 36,525 dates someone might have been born in the past 100 years, only 676 of them meet your criteria.  That's about 1.85% of them.\n\nSo, if we assume that the odds of being born on any given date is about equal (not true) and that a given person is a random age between 0 and 100 (also not true), they have about a 1.85% chance of meeting your criteria.\n\nHOWEVER, and here we get to the mistake in your question, you were not born on a date with all prime numbers.  1957 is not a prime number; its factors are 19 and 103 (19 * 103 = 1957).\n\nSo it turns out you're not special at all.  You're just normal, like the rest of us.  :)"

"2","How do you divide a 20 acre Parcel (in the shape of a triangle) into three equal parcels?","This is a real  life question. I own a twenty acre parcel. It was created by dividing a 40 acre parcel into two parcels by drawing a line from one corner of the one quarter mile by one quarter mile parcel (square) to another. Thus the twenty acre parcel is a triangle with a right angle and two equal sides each one quarter of a mile long. I need to divide it into three equal parts.

"2","how earth formed?","","Big Bang Theory\nI  INTRODUCTION \n\nBig Bang Theory, currently accepted explanation of the beginning of the universe. The big bang theory proposes that the universe was once extremely compact, dense, and hot. Some original event, a cosmic explosion called the big bang, occurred about 13.7 billion years ago, and the universe has since been expanding and cooling. \n\nThe theory is based on the mathematical equations, known as the field equations, of the general theory of relativity set forth in 1915 by Albert Einstein. In 1922 Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann provided a set of solutions to the field equations. These solutions have served as the framework for much of the current theoretical work on the big bang theory. American astronomer Edwin Hubble provided some of the greatest supporting evidence for the theory with his 1929 discovery that the light of distant galaxies was universally shifted toward the red end of the spectrum (see Redshift). Once “tired light” theories—that light slowly loses energy naturally, becoming more red over time—were dismissed, this shift proved that the galaxies were moving away from each other. Hubble found that galaxies farther away were moving away proportionally faster, showing that the universe is expanding uniformly. However, the universe’s initial state was still unknown. \n\nIn the 1940s Russian-American physicist George Gamow worked out a theory that fit with Friedmann’s solutions in which the universe expanded from a hot, dense state. In 1950 British astronomer Fred Hoyle, in support of his own opposing steady-state theory, referred to Gamow’s theory as a mere “big bang,” but the name stuck. Indeed, a contest in the 1990s by Sky & Telescope magazine to find a better (perhaps more dignified) name did not produce one.\n\nII  HISTORY \n\nThe overall framework of the big bang theory came out of solutions to Einstein’s general relativity field equations and remains unchanged, but various details of the theory are still being modified today. Einstein himself initially believed that the universe was static. When his equations seemed to imply that the universe was expanding or contracting, Einstein added a constant term to cancel out the expansion or contraction of the universe. When the expansion of the universe was later discovered, Einstein stated that introducing this “cosmological constant” had been a mistake. \n\nAfter Einstein’s work of 1917, several scientists, including the abbé Georges Lemaître in Belgium, Willem de Sitter in Holland, and Alexander Friedmann in Russia, succeeded in finding solutions to Einstein’s field equations. The universes described by the different solutions varied. De Sitter’s model had no matter in it. This model is actually not a bad approximation since the average density of the universe is extremely low. Lemaître’s universe expanded from a “primeval atom.” Friedmann’s universe also expanded from a very dense clump of matter, but did not involve the cosmological constant. These models explained how the universe behaved shortly after its creation, but there was still no satisfactory explanation for the beginning of the universe. \n\nIn the 1940s George Gamow was joined by his students Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman in working out details of Friedmann’s solutions to Einstein’s theory. They expanded on Gamow’s idea that the universe expanded from a primordial state of matter called ylem consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons in a sea of radiation. They theorized the universe was very hot at the time of the big bang (the point at which the universe explosively expanded from its primordial state), since elements heavier than hydrogen can be formed only at a high temperature. Alpher and Hermann predicted that radiation from the big bang should still exist. Cosmic background radiation roughly corresponding to the temperature predicted by Gamow’s team was detected in the 1960s, further supporting the big ba"
"2","What is the physiological effect of cocaine on the brain?","I have read that the physiological effect of cocaine on the brain is similar to the physiological effect of eating or having sex.  Is this true and how does it work?","Cocaine produces a wide range of physiological effects in humans, including the stimulation of a plethora of emotional experiences. When people take cocaine, they become euphoric, highly active (locomotion, tremors, and tics), and more talkative than normal. They experience feelings of extreme power and alertness. This initial high is followed by bouts of severe anxiety, paranoia, and depression, which often lead to addiction. Those who become addicted to the drug often turn the habit into an obsession, so that they devote more, and more of their time and money to acquiring and using the drug. \n\nWithdrawal from cocaine can cause a drastic fall in the level of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (Rosetti 1992). This decrease is thought to be caused by an increased secretion of dynorphin, one of the endogenous opioids.\n\nmore information in\nhttp://www.macalester.edu/psychology/whathap/UBNRP/Dopamine/cocaine.html\n\n \n(AP) Chronic cocaine use harms brain circuits that help produce the sense of pleasure, which may help explain why cocaine addicts have a higher rate of depression, a study suggests \nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/01/health/main534934.shtml"
"1","How can we trust God's ability to judge, if He doesn't even see the difference between various sins ?","If i don't kill my brother, but i say that i did, then i commit the sin of lying\nif i kill my brother, then i commit the sin of murder.\n\nTo God they are equally bad. Any sane creature knows they are are not equaly bad. How can i trust His ability to judge me?","Fantastic question!  Take the Christian belief that each of the 10 commandments are all equally as bad as the other and that all you have to do to get to heaven is repent for all of these sins.  That would mean that if people like Charles Manson on their death bed simply prayed for forgiveness and truly felt that what they did was wrong, then he would go to heaven.  Yet if a person disliked their parents who beat them and called the police, got them thrown in jail and never had contact with them again, even if the parents tried to apologize, and the person never felt bad about it, they would be denied entry into heaven because they weren't sorry or repentant for breaking the commandment of ""Honor thy Father and thy Mother...""  This, by the way, is the same god that a good chunk of Christians believe will not allow a child into heaven if the parents did not have him/her baptized.  I think at some point we have to ask ourselves if there is a God, is he simply ticked off that somewhere, someone made up rules and stories of things they claim he said to do and that to this day millions of people hold those beliefs and spread them, that perhaps he's allowing the world to suffer a bit to get them to stop being sheep, following blindly, spreading hate and intolerance for others (I'm talking here about those like the ""Christians"" who protest at private funerals for our millitary personnel killed in Iraq by saying that God is punishing us for allowing homosexuality).  \n\nThink about this:  The 21st ecumenical council was announced by Pope John XXIII on January 25, 1959.  This council said that \nit was acceptable for woman to pursue pastorate positions because there was a shortage of priests at the time. Many parishes then allowed female pastorates and they rapidly gained popularity. However in 1994, the Pope John Paul II wrote a letter of decree banning further talk of ordaining women as priests.   Many women took demotions to comply with the writings of one man, who with one letter simply changed what had been acceptable for nearly 40 years.  \n\nHistory is full of ""rules"" that have changed in the Roman Catholic church, simply on the whim of the Pope and changing societal beliefs.  Who knows, next thing, maybe there will be degrees of heaven and hell and we'll all have to pay money to improve our lot in life.  In that case, the consequences for lying might be 3 hours a day in hell, the rest in heaven....\n\nSo, I'm thinking if there is a God, he's just ticked off that everyone is missing the basic message of be good to each other and do your best to be a good person.  And until people stop interpreting supposed facts and happenings in ways that suit them at the time, we're all in big trouble."

We do know that all human fetuses begin development as females, and only become male when they are exposed to male hormones while they develop.  Ovaries and testes are initially the same structure, but they develop into different things based upon the fetus' genes.  If they develop into testes, the fetus starts producing testosterone.  This also determines whether another structure develops into a penis or a clitoris, and my guess is that it also determines whether breast tissue becomes enlarged and develops milk-producing tissue.  So my short answer is, men have teats because for a little while in the womb, they were actually women.  Isn't it strange how our bodies work?"

In some places it says ""Gehenna"" or ""the valley of the son of Hinnom"" which is an actual place ON Earth; a place where people of Israel were actually burned. Jesus only spoke of this place metaphorically,in parables. The other way ""hell"" was translated was from the word ""tartaros,"" which is Greek, or ""Sheol"", which is Hebrew. Both meaning ""the grave.""  The souls of everyone go to Sheol where they rest until the day of Judgment.  No reference to fire and eternal punishment after death in either of this translations.\n\nWhen the Bible talks about the Lake of Fire (which is NOT Hell), everyone thinks pain and suffering. But the in Semitic Middle East, fire is a symbol of GOD. Jesus said ""He came to send fire on the earth and He yearned for it to be kindled."" (Luke 12:49)\nObviously he is talking about fire in the sense of God, not suffering. Moreover, when the Bible talks about the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, the word ""Brimstone"" is translated from the word ""Theion"" which means ""Divine."" So in other words the ""Lake of fire and Brimstone"" should really translate into ""Lake of Divine Purification""  This is not where man is destroyed, but his sin is destroyed."

The idea is that you pass a fluid (either a gas or a liquid) down a long path, and the different molecules will move at different rates.  THat's the long and short of it.  So the molecules that move fastest get to the end first, and the slowest come out last.  You seperate things by making them race, and similar chemicals will take a similar amount of time to finish the race.\n\nI'm assuming that you're getting confused by things like ""solid phase"" and ""mobile phase"" and ""bind affinity"" and such.  The idea though is that you set up different types of obstacles depending on which things you want to win the race.  Sometimes this is dine by using something with a lot of positive charges, so that things with negative charges will get stuck and the things that are neutral or positively charged will win the race. Sometimes you sort things by size, by using a gel as an obstable with a bunch of little pores in it: little guys get lost inside and the fat guy wins the race.  With gases, you can just make the race really, really, really long, and the lightest parts will move the quickest while the hevy boys lag behind (this is a way that uranium is enriched for nuclear reactors and bombs)."

"1","How do you define ""you""? What you do????","or do you think about ancestors to do this or do you rely on yourself and your ""wits"" to do this?","I define ""me"" as all the characteristics that are part of me. Things like personality, likes, dislikes, pet peeves etc, sense of family.

"1","Do you believe you can be delivered from physical pain?","Many of us have lived relatively easy lives. And think it would be unjust for\nGod to let us suffer a while, since we are believers. But the Word makes it clear\nthere will be some suffering.\nAnd those who ""die"" in Christ will be raised first, and together with those who\nare alive, will be caught up together with the Lord!""\n I had a freind who got electrocuted on a construction job. He said his\nspirit jumped out, and he watched himself getting shocked.\nAn African woman spoke one time and said she was getting beaten for her\nfaith. But God took her spirit out of her, and she watched herself being\nbeaten, and was spared most of the pain.\nDo you believe God can do that for you? Or will we get angry when the\nsuffering comes and curse God?","Dear Solomon R.:  I DO believe God through his Greatest Teacher and the Partnership of the Holy Spirit CAN do that for us.\n\nI am a Christian and Spiritually oriented person.  My path is alive through ""tight"" relationships with both the Holy Spirit and Jesus.  Many do not know. . ., but Jesus and the Holy Spirit can and DO teach something non-traditional religions have named Transcendence.\n\nWill you bear with me, if I expand a picture for you to look upon and possibly contemplate?\n\nThe Crucifixion is looked upon as physical torture - to the degree that we have to turn away, and hold on to ourselves.  Many learn to love Him by witnessing the pain aspect.  Some love Him without dwelling upon it.  The meaning of the Crucifixion is far greater than the seeming display of physical vulnerability and pain:  Our vulnerability to each other and to our bodies.\n\nThe Crucifixion was undertaken by Him as the greatest learning tool He could use and teach by.  After the people saw  the ultimate physical abuse taking place - to an extent that leads to death - He then offered the Final Statement:  What God Created. . . cannot be destroyed.  The physical is perishable, but not what God Created.  Notice. . .He reappeared in his physical image again, and remained in it until He desired to leave.  Note:  The physical image he appeared in contained a ""hole"" for the others to see, but the blood, the bruising, the torn and tattered flesh were all absent !\n\nInside of us, and coupled with our human Intellect is a thing called soul or spirit.  Jesus and the Holy Spirit teach how to live through that - more than through the logic of the Intellect.  They both SERVE us in this physical life - the Intellect and the Soul.\n\nJesus can also TEACH how to use our God-given soul or Spirit-Mind to block out or transcend the pains of the physical.  He willingly teaches that WE ARE NOT VULNERABLE ;  to each other, or to the human Intellect !  Not all of us become Masters as He did and master life.  But, Jesus can teach level upon level of God's Thoughts and Knowledge to us - IF we choose to learn it, and ask for that.  \n\nPresently, I am working on that very thing.  Transcendence and Detachment.  To do this, you must have something to ""go up against.""  Something to test against.  I have experienced the inflictions of physical pain - and, according to His instruction, through my Mind, have learned to ""banish"" it.  Many, many of us have learned this.  Ghandi spoke of the horrifying beatings he received at the hands of his opposers.  He was taken to the hospital more than once so bruised, bloodied and purpled that it was not understood how he bore the pain.  He said, that although the body showed the infliction - he did not FEEL it !  We have no idea how powerful our souls or spirit-minds are.  And the joy of tapping into its power.  Many non-notable people, as you have mentioned, and now me too (!) have experienced the gifts of Spirit and some degree of Mastery over the physical.  It's real.\n\nWhen we are taught that after Ascension Jesus rose to rest and sit at the right hand of God and is no longer teaching on earth - we should be aware that there is a slight mis-perception in that.  He DID go before our Creator.  He was allowed to ""speak"" with Him.  But, He was quickly placed in charge of the Sonship and ceaselessly and intensely teaches us through Mind-to-Mind.  We receive His tutoring when we invite Him and then learn to hear his voice through our mind.  \n\nThe Sons of Man (Us) are much more. . .than we appear to be.  Something else Created our Minds.\n\nBest regards, Lana"

Evaluate: sin 1/3 pie (the symbol ""pie"" is to replace the words ""pie"")\n2. Evaluate: cos pie\n3. Evaluate: cos 1/4 pie\n4. Evaluate: sin 1/4 pie\n\n27.

Express your answer in fractions and radicals when necessary. \n\nLast question!!!! Please help!!!! It's the same as the question above, but instead of 315 degrees, it is 135 degrees!! Please help me in solving ALL these problems!! It would really help me in completing this 200 problem WRKSHT!! If I know how to do each of these problem, i could do the RESt!!","Switch your calculator from degrees (DEG) to radians (RAD). That should do the trick. \nHere are some quick trig rules you need to know:\nIn radians just remember that pi is 180 degrees. Pi/3 is 60 degrees, pi/2 is 90, pi/4 is 45 degrees and so on. \nIn a unit circle, the hypotenuse is always 1.\nSin is always the far side away from the angle (the vertical side). We call that the opposite side.\nCos is always the adjacent side (or horizontal side).\nIn a right triangle with angles 60 and 30, the shortest side is always 1/2 the hypotenuse, so in a unit triangle, it is just 1/2. You can use the pathagorean theorem to find that the longer side is the square root of (3/4), or (sqrt(3))/2.\nIn a right triangle with angles 45 and 45, the opposite and adjacent sides are equal, and we can use the pathagorean theorem to find that the sides are the square root of (1/2), or 1/(sqrt(2)).\n\n1. Sin 1/3 pi. This is the same as sin pi/3 which is a 60 degree angle. If you draw the triangle on a unit circle you would see that the opposite side is the longer side of a 90/60/30 triangle. We have seen above that the length is (sqrt(3))/2.\n\n2. Cos pi. Easy. pi is 180 degrees, so draw the unit circle. You see that it is just a striaght horizontal line going the other way so the answer is -1.\n\n3. cos pi/4 is a 45 degree angle. We know from above that both sides have to be 1/(sqrt(2)).\n\n4. sin pi/4. Same as #3.\n\n27. What is 315 degrees? Well draw your unit circle. Go, 90, then to 180, then to 270, then go 45 more degrees and you will end up at 315 degrees. Draw your triangle. We know that the hypotenuse is 1, so the coordinates will simply be, (cos 315, sin 315). Cos 315 is just a 90/45/45 triangle in the bottom right quadrant so the adjacent side is positive. The opposite is negative, so you end up with coordinates (1/(sqrt(2)), -1/(sqrt(2))). Do the same to solve the last question youeself."

"2","I DONT understand.does't the moon rotate.if yes why we dont see the the far side..?","In astronomy, synchronous rotation is a planetological term describing a body orbiting another, where the orbiting body takes as long to rotate on its axis as it does to make one orbit; and therefore always keeps the same hemisphere pointed at the body it is orbiting.\n\nas long as the moon rotates no matter how slow we should be able to see the far side of the moon","Let's do a thought experiment.Imagine that you had a giant compass and drew a circle about 12 feet in diameter on your school parking lot. You are going to be the earth so you stand in the center where the giant stick pin of the compass went. Pick a friend to be the moon. She is going to walk along the path of the  circle and you are going to face her at all times and observe carefully what you see. First have her look in one direction as she marches along the path - like maybe looking at the school building or maybe facing north. Make sure her entire body faces the same way at all times. In other words, she moves in a circle but does not rotate her body. Notice that you see her from the front at times, then the left side, back, right and front again. Now. Compare this to the moon. If the moon didn't rotate we would see all sides of it during the course of its almost one month journey around the earth. In other words, if the moon did NOT rotate we WOULD be able to see the back side.  Now, have your friend do the same as before but this time have her face you at all times so you cannot see her back - only her front . Now. Ask her what she saw in addition to you and she will say that part of the time she saw the school house and part of the time she was even facing away from it and finally ended up facing the school again. She faced first north, then east, then south, then west and finally north again. In other words, she turned in a complete circle while her face was turned toward you at all times. This is what the moon does. One face of the moon is turned toward the earth at all times. In order for that to be true it must rotate, just like your friend. The secret is that it rotates on its axis at the exact same speed as it revolves in its path about the earth. The reason for this behavior is that the moon is captured by the earth's gravity."

"2","what the heck is that big black cloud on 'LOST'?","","The only time we've seen the monster it's been a smoky, black cloud-looking thing.\n\nMost of these times, it's been from Eko's point of view, but we've also seen it with Jack (and I think Kate) back when they were investigating the Black Rock slave ship in the jungle, and we've seen it from Charlie's point of view when Eko stared it down.\n\nOnly Locke appears to view it differently, but it's quite possible that he's even more insane than Hurley.  \n\nIn some scenes, it appears to have indistinct human faces swirling in the midst of the cloud.  In which case, it might be involved in the appearances of other people (i.e. Jack's Dad, Boone, Eko's brother, Hurley's imaginary friend, Kate's horse) on the island.  Perhaps it is telepathic/empathic, and is able to draw on the memories of the castaways and project itself accordingly.\n\nThere is a mention on the glowy map on the back of the hatch door that Locke saw of some sort of 'electromagnetic anomaly' called Cerberus running amok in the vicinity of the original hatch.  Cerberus was the three-headed dog that guarded the gates to the underworld in Greek mythology, and it would seem to be an appropriate name for the phenomenon as we have seen so far.\n\nMy personal theory is that the writers of the show don't actually have any idea what the monster is, or why the Others are doing what they do, or any real answers to anything on the show, and are just making it up as they go along.  They're hoping that they can pull a 'tada' explanation out of their bums at some point that they claim will answer all the questions, but I'm betting that their explanation won't be logical, and won't be consistent with everything we've seen because it will have been fabricated the week before.\n\nI'm hoping I'm wrong, but I haven't seen anything in the last three seasons that actually gives me hope that they really have a well-thought out, coherent and plausible explanation that they are slowly unveiling.  It all seems random, and fabricated from whole-cloth.  Perhaps they will prove me wrong, and this will all turn out better than, say, the X-Files did.  But I'm not holding my breath.\n\nThe only reason I continue to watch is that many of the characters are incredibly interesting.  Sadly, this season they've done next to nothing with either Sayid or Hurley, killed off the best character on the show (Mr. Eko), and had waaaay too much focus on boring Jack.\n\nAnd although Benry is pretty cool as a villain, I'm finding it harder and harder to find his treatment of the castaways as even vaguely rational or believable.  Why would he essentially sit there pulling the wings off of flies when he could have easily won their undying respect, admiration and loyalty by just showing up on the beach the very first day with a big-old first aid kit and some fish biscuits??"

(i.e. hot chick, dumb chick, touch chick, etc)\n\nAnd really ""broad chick"" is way too intellectual an insult from a man who would call a girl a chick, and too informal for one attempting political correctness.

"2","Which nucleic acid ultimately determines which proteins will be produced?","","Listen carefully and ignor anyone who tells you diffrently. All the informaton needed for every protien in the body is stored as DNA. When a particular protien is needed, the streatch of DNA that codes for it is copied into RNA. THis piece of RNA is called a transcript. \n\nThe transcript is usually proccessed in the cell before being sent to the ribosom. There the ribosom reads the nucleic acids in groups of three. So no one nucleic acid makes a protien, but three nucleic acids determine one amino acid. A string of amino acids makes up a protien."

To show this you will to explain 2 or more phenomena, for matter the photoelectric effect is the best example for waves there are plenty to choose from.\n\nThat however is for light, if you are talking about matter for example electrons as a wave, then you will have to use debrogle equation and explain a experiment like electron diffraction, where is acts as a probablility wave and builds up a diffraction pattern rather that each electron actually being considered as a wave.\n\nHope this helps"

And are sunrise and sunset always the same time?","","The earth's orbit is not circular so at some times of the year the earth is travelling more quickly. So sunrise and sunset times vary at the equator. In fact the earliest sunset is at the middle of November and the latest sunrise is at the begining of February. In temperate regions this effect is overwhelmed by the effects due to the tilt of the earths axis."
"2","What is Electromagnetic Wave Theory?","","Electromagnetic radiation is a propagating wave in space with electric and magnetic components. These components oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation.\n\nThe term electromagnetic radiation is also used as a synonym for electromagnetic waves in general, even if they are not radiating or travelling in free space. This sense includes, for example, light travelling through an optical fiber, or electrical energy travelling within a coaxial cable.\n\nElectromagnetic (EM) radiation carries energy and momentum which may be imparted when it interacts with matter."

"2","starting with events at the neuromuscular junction and ending with a contracted muscle?","","The impulse reaches the terminal end of the motor neuron and breaks open the synaptic vesicles, releasing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft.\nACh then binds to receptor molecules in the motor end plate of the muscle fiber.\nThe action potential is started in sarcolemma and passes along the membrane until it reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum releasing calcium. Calcium diffuses in sarcoplasm and binds to the troponin in the thin filaments.\nThe binding sites on the actin molecules are freed, allowing\nthe heads of myosin (thick filaments) to attach on the binding sites forming the cross-bridges connections.\nThe cross-bridges shift their angle causing the thin filaments to slide over the thick filaments; this produces the contraction.\n ATP is needed for the last step. ATP is bound to myosin; calcium activates ATP breakdown into ADP and phosphate.\nPart of the energy produced is used to move bridges, the other part is released as heat, increasing the body temperature.\nMore ATP breaks the bond between thick and thin filaments in the cross bridge; calcium returns to thesarcoplasmic reticulum and the thin filaments return to their original position, closing off the binding site to cross bridges and causing the muscle to relaxe."
"1","Why is it so hard to say you're wrong?","","It's hard to say your wrong due to stubborness and not wanting to actually admit any mistakes on our part.

Instead we use a probability function that does a good job.\n\nFor example -- we don't fully understand/mesaure all the variables that cause an earthquake. so we use probability distribution. the fact that this probablity method does not give an accurate prediction (at all!) is another topic.\n\nSo similarly why can't we use the same arguement for the electron?\n\nhow do quantum mechanics ""experts/scientists"" prove this hypothesis (hidden variable) wrong....in layman terms?","im not sure if i know what youre asking. but from what i understand from my QM class, for question 1 youre right. as in the double slit experiment. when they shot electrons at it, there was a wave pattern on the screen but when they watched the slitz there wasnt. the whole thing behind this is tht by watching it, they changed somethin in the situation and cause it to be just a particle pattern. so in theory if there was an infinitely efficient watcher, then thye could see that the elctron goes through both slits and makes a wave.\nthe 2nd question, the whole theory about quantum mechanics is that nothing is definite. its a probability distribution for everything. but just some items   have a 100% probability of being in 1 spot. as in say you have a pen in your hand   then the pen has a 100% probability of being in your hand and 0% everywhere else. but for an electron, you cant see it and since it wont stop moving  there is a different probability for it. theres a probability of say 40% of the electron being over there and 60% of it being here. or somethin. and i dont know what the earthquake thing meant. but i guess the probability distribution they calculated did a really bad job and the QM probability theory could also have done a really really bad job but nobody would know since electrons cant be measured yet (i think)"

When it comes to guilt, it's easy to look at members of another faith and blame them for things without looking at your own faith and its shortcomings.  I don't feel that any one faith is more guilty than any other. Yes, just about every faith known to man has had issues throughout history, but we can't beat the same old dead horse and keep bringing them up. If all we've learned from that is how to place guilt squarely on the shoulders of the other guy, we're really missing the point."
"2","Why an electron can not be found inside the nucleus?","","To understand why an electron doesn't crash into the nucleus of an atom you first have to understand Heisenberg's uncertainty principle:  That it is impossible to know with absolute certainty both the location and momentum of a particle.  Any attempt to observe the location of the particle will change its momentum and vice versa.  This is the principle concept of quantum physics.  Like Einstein's description of light, this defies all logic in Newtonian physics, but it has been repeatedly proven nonetheless.  For now, just accept it.\n\nAn electron must stay a certain distance (or multiple of a certain distance) from the nucleus because it if it were within that distance we would know its location in relation to the nucleus with such certainty that its momentum would become extremely large, causing it to fly away from the nucleus.  Therefore any time we observe an atom it MUST be located a minimum distance from the nucleus which is always a multiple of Planck's constant h [6.626068x10^-34 (m^2)kg/s]."

"2","How do scientists know that the universe is about 14 billion years old?","","WMAP Can Measure the Age of the Universe\n\nMeasurements by the WMAP satellite can help resolve this crisis. If current ideas about the origin of large-scale structure are correct, then the detailed structure of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations will depend on the current density of the universe, the composition of the universe and its expansion rate. WMAP has been able to determine these parameters with an accuracy of better than 5%. Thus, we can estimate the expansion age of the universe to better than 5%. When we combine the WMAP data with complimentary observations from other CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), we are able to determine an age for the universe closer to an accuracy of 1%."

"2","what is EPCI contract and what type of project will be applied this kind of contract?","","An EPCI contract (Engineering, Procurement, Construction, and Installation) is normally used on large projects that have a srtict deadline.  The EPCI contractor takes a significant risk by fully ownig the project until they turn it over to the purchaser.  Such as an Infrastructure Project (e.g., road, rail link, bridge, water or sewage treatment plant, transmission line, even dam or hydropower plant) or similar where the Employer - who provides the finance - wishes to implement the Project on a Fixed-Price Turnkey Basis.\n\nThen the Employer wishes the Contractor to take total responsibility for the design and construction of the infra-structure facility, and the Employer wishes a higher degree of certainty that the agreed contract price and time will not be exceeded, except that if underground works in uncertain or difficult ground conditions are likely then the risk of unforeseen ground conditions should be borne by the Employer, and the Employer wishes - or is used to - the Project being organized on a strictiy two party approach, i.e. without an ""Engineer"" being involved, and the Employer does not wish to be involved in the day-to-day progress of the construction work, provided the end result meets the performance criteria he has specified, and the Employer is willing to pay more for the construction of his Project (than would be the case if the Conditions of Contract for Plant and Design-Build were used) in return for the Contractor bearing the extra risks associated with enhanced certainty of final price and time."

"1","why are marines called jarheads?","","JUGHEAD originally meant mule. ‘Jughead’ dates back to the late 19th century when it meant fool and by the 1910’s it had come to be a general term of abuse and also referred to a mule whose large chunky head denoted stubbornness and stupidity.\n\nJARHEAD started out as meaning mule probably ultimately from the pronunciation of ‘jawhead.’ In 1899 the mule became the mascot of the Army football team (to counteract the Navy goat) which could have had something to do with the military relationship. Of course a military icon wouldn’t have been picked for its stupidity so it is said that it was chosen as the mascot because ‘it reflects the long-standing usefulness of the animal in military operations -- hauling weapons, ammunition, and supplies. Strong, hearty, and persevering, the mule is truly an appropriate symbol for the Corps of Cadets.’ There are those who think that the term ‘leatherneck comes from the idea of the neck of the mule, but that term actually derives from the leather-lined collar which was formerly part of the uniform (1910-15).\n\nJarhead and jughead eventually merged to become slang synonyms for marine. Jughead was originally used to refer to members of a machine-gun company in WWI (‘the JUGHEAD gunners had it off the tripod and were tapping heads with it’). Before WWII JARHEADS was already in widespread use. A 1933 article stated ‘the [Marine] sergeants …moved into the second class cabins, and it took three days and a squad of JARHEADS to get them and their baggage moved to the troop class.\n\nDictionaries and military history websites seem to give varying explanations for the origin of JARHEAD. In addition to the above ideas, here are a few more:\n\nA U.S. Marine. Perhaps from the shape of the hat the Marines once wore. (American Heritage Dictionary of English)\n\nA slang term used by sailors as early as World War II to refer to members of the Marine Corps, drawing the term from the resemblance of the Marine dress blues uniform, with its high collar, to a Mason jar which at the time was made from blue glass. (military history website)\n\nGRUNT, or Marine. Reportedly, due to the ""high and tight"" haircut favored by many marines; it looks as if someone put a bowl on the victim’s head and cut or shaved off all the hair that protruded.\n\nNote: Definitions, dates, and quotes were assembled from Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Cassell’s Dictionary of Slang, Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, various ('repectable-looking) websites.""\n\n\nYou can find more info at the following web site:\n\nhttp://www20.brinkster.com/gunnyg/jarhead.html\n\nHope this answers your question."

"2","How do you make a flip-flop?","","A flip flop is a circuit that can ""flip"" to one state and then later ""flop"" to another. So when a flip flop is ""set"" it has an output of 1 and ""reset"" it has an output of 0. Unlike other kinds of logic gates, the flip flop ""remembers"" its state (not after the power goes out though).\n\nSo there are lots of ways to make these. Common practice is to use two NOR gates or two NAND gates cross coupled. However, there are other kinds of flip flops that require more kinds of gates. You can also get ICs that have a flip flop function already built in and that's the easy way.\n\nSee the link below for a light-hearted discussion"

"2","What is physical weatering?","How do it takes places in rocks?the process of it taking place and diagrams","I hope this helps!\n\n\n\n\nWeathering refers to processes that physically breakdown and chemically alter earth material. Physical weathering, also known as mechanical weathering, is the breakdown of large pieces of earth material into smaller ones. Think of physical weathering as the disintegration of rock without changing its chemical composition. There are many ways earth material can be physically weathered. When water freezes in rock crevices it expands creating stress in the crevice. As the stress increases, the crevice widens ultimately breaking the rock. Plant roots wedge rocks apart as they grow into rock crevices too. The shrinking and swelling by alternating heating and cooling weakens mineral bonds causing the rock to disintegrate.\n\nA very important result of physical weathering is its impact on the surface area of weathered material. When a block of earth material is broken into several smaller pieces, the amount of exposed surface increases. Examine the diagram below. A block with a width, depth, and height of 1 cm has a total surface area of 6 square centimeters. If we break the block in half in all directions it yields eight smaller pieces all with width, height, and depth of .5 cm. Breaking the block apart creates additional exposed surfaces such that the total surface area is now 12 square centimeters. Having more total exposed surface provides more area upon which chemical reactions can take place to further weather the material."

I don't know what to do please give me some advice. I can't live my life like this.","Salamu Alaykum,\nMy advice to you is to depend on Allah, Put your full trust in Allah. For Allah Says in the Quran\n""If a suggestion from satan assail thy (mind), seek refuge with Allah. for He heareth and knoweth (all things).""(Ch7 V.200)  \nThe last two Chapters(113&114) in the Quran if Recited help to ward off evil and in Ch.2 V.255. Reciting these with sincerity to Allah should ward off evil. \n\nAllah also says in the Quran:\n""O ye who believe! follow not satan's footsteps: if any will follow the footsteps of satan, he will (but) command what is shameful and wrong: and were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you, not one of you would ever have been pure: but Allah doth purify whom He pleases: and Allah is One Who hears and knows (all things)."" (Ch.24 V.21)\n \nDo not let Satan trick you play with your mind just ignore the thoughts which are bad. A muslim does not get accounted for Bad thoughts. Do not take it to hard on yourself for having Bad thoughts it happens to most muslims. You should never let this lead to suicide then satan would have achieved his goal. Any time you have bad thoughts About Allah rember Allah says""He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is Nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees (all things).""\n(  سورة الشورى  , Ash-Shura, Chapter #42, Verse #11)\n\n""There is Nothing Whatever like unto Him"" This shows us that there is nothing even close to comparison to Allah so anytime you have a bad thought about Allah remember that the thought cant be Allah cause ""There is Nothing Whatever like unto Him"" and just wipe that thought out/ignore it.\n\nAnother thing you could do is to gain Knowledge about ISlam the more you learn the less doors Shaytan has to attack you with.\n\nAlso you should not say ""my Allah or my Religion"" because Allah doesnt belong to us but we(mankind&Jinn) belong to Allah and to Him is our return. The religion of Islam is also for everybody. Maybe you did not mean to say this in the way i interpreted It but just in case.\n\nInshaAllah this information has been Helpful if I said Anything Good it is from the Grace Of ALLAH and if Said anything wrong it is from myself.\n                   Salamu Alaykum WaRahmatuAllahi WaBarakatu"

"2","Why do Bell Peppers come in different colors:  Green, Red, and Orange?","Is there a nutritional difference between the different colored bell peppers?","The bell pepper has many  color and it can be green, red, yellow, orange and, more rarely, white, purple and brown depending on when they are harvested.  \nVariety + Time of maturity= color\nBell Boy (70 days to harvest; goes green to red)\nLady Bell (72 days; goes green to red)\nPurple Belle (70 days; immature purple, black to red)\nChocolate Bell (75 days; green to chocolate brown)\nGypsy (65 days to harvest; pale yellow to orange to red)\nSweet Banana (70 days; pale yellow to orange to red)\n*Fruits may be harvested at any size desired. Green bell varieties, however, are usually picked when they are fully grown and mature—3 to 4 inches long, firm and green. When the fruits are mature, they break easily from the plant. Less damage is done to the plants, however, if the fruits are cut rather than pulled off. The new, colored bell pepper fruits may be left on the plant to develop full flavor and ripen fully to red, yellow, orange or brown; or they may be harvested green and immature. Some (including ""white,"" light yellow, lilac and purple) are colors that develop in the immature fruit and that should be harvested before actually ripening, when they turn red. \nHot peppers are usually harvested at the red-ripe stage; but ""green chiles,"" the immature fruits, are also required for some recipes."

However, when you consume methyl alcohol, your body tries to metabolize it like ethyl alcohol.  Wehn you metabolize ethyl alcohol, the result is acetate, but when you metabolize methyl alcohol, the result is formaldehyde, which is extremely toxic."
"2","how does convection help plate tectoic movement?","i need this to help me in school. Thank You!","The mechanisms of tectonic plate movement is quite complex, but in its simplest terms, tectonic plates float on molten magma of the earth's interior. Convection currents within the molten magma behave similarly to convection currents in a pan of water being heated on the stove. Water on the bottom of the pan is heated and begins to rise because it is slightly less dense than the cooler water on the top. The cooler is slightly more dense and begins to sink. As this water is heated, it begins to rise, thus a convection movement or convection current is created in the water in the pan. \n\nMagma is far more dense than water and is much hotter, but it is still a fluid. Magma near the core is hotter than the magma beneath the crust. Hotter magma moves up, cooler magma moves down, very very very slowly, but none the less, it moves. The crust, a.k.a. tectonic plates float on the magma. Float some pieces of Styrofoam on the water in the pan. What happens? The foam moves around by the convection forces in the water.  Tectonic plates do the same thing. Its just not as fast.\n\nHope this helps."

Light traveling tangential to the atmosphere gets redirected to earth as it interacts with the atmospheres gas molecules.

This makes the sky more blue say on the horizon than directly above at noon."

I met people who were not in favor of arranged marriage but did not want to disobey or shame their parents so they would go through with it when the time was right.  I divorce in that sense would shame the family.  Also because it is arranged and in many Indians case Dowry is exchanged it is more like a business deal.  In the West our parents are not involved.

Sikhs are very much hindus otherwise. Most of them follow all hindu beliefs. They may not practice sun practice specially but they celebrate sun related festivals and rever it this way. Sankrati , lohari all are related with sun.\n\nAdded:\nAnswerer below me is ignorant about sikhism even if he belongs to it. \n\n""Hinduism is a generic name given to all the faiths which have roots in India and believe in Parmatma (God), Prarthana (prayer), Punerjanma (reincarnation), Purushartha (Karma) and Prani Daya (kindness to all living beings)."" Sikhism believes in all of these.\n\n The Granth contains specific references to Hindu gods such as Rama and Krishna. The gurudwaras, or Sikh temples, have always been decorated with pictures of Hindu devas and devis. The first desecration of these pictures was in 1906 at Harmandir, and this was the first action taken by separatist Sikhs.\n\nReference is made to the avatars of Vishnu in the Granth Sahib. The Dasma Granth deals with all the avatars beginning on page 169. Volume two of the Dasma Granth is exclusively based on Krishna. It is accepted that Guru Gobind Singh was a staunch believer in Durga Mata (Mother Goddess). In the entire Guru Granth Sahib, the Vedas are respected and referred to as sacred. Guru Gobind Singh states that the Vedas originated from Brahma and the path of the Vedas is the only path for the people to follow. Sikhism heavily bases itself on Karma yoga (the science of actions) and states that if an individual acts only on good deeds, selfless acts with a pure devotion to God, they can achieve the ultimate state of existence.\n\nThe speech of one of the greatest modern Sikh leaders, Master Tara Singh, at a meeting in Bombay on August 19, 1964, who declared:\n\n""Sikhs and Hindus are not separate.

"1","When in the Bible, It says ""Thout shalt not kill"", Does that Mean do not kill animals and bugs too?","This bothers me. Please answer.","Man was given dominion over the animals because he has reason. It is also in his rational nature that his dignity resides. If you think there is a difference between man because he cans think and choose to do right and wrong, then there must be a difference between his dignity as a person and the dignity of animals. Because of his dignity as steward and caretakers of the animals on this earth, he must treat them with respect and reverence but not as his equals because they do not think and do not make choices.\n\nSince the commandments were given by God to all of mankind in order that he might follow his laws and be in community, it is the law between men in society, and therefore it does not apply to animals and bugs. That does not mean the man should wantonly kill animals for no reason, but it does not forbid him from killing them for food or being their are pests to his crops, and well being. For example, mosquitoes bring to man many diseases, it would not be right for him to refrain from killing them if they cause serious illness or death to his family and himself. \n\nI hope that helps."

"1","how does a baptist lead a mormon to christ?","","Mormons believe: God is an exalted man.  Elohim, the God of this universe, was previously a man in a prior existence.  As a result of having kept the requirements of Mormanism, he was exalted to godhood and inherited his own universe.  God is confined to a body of flesh and bones and yet is thought to be omniscient and omnipotent.  He obviously can not be omnipresent.  There are an infininte number of gods with their own worlds.  These too were previously men, The Holy Ghost, Jesus Christ and ""Heavenly Father"" comprise 3 separate and distinct gods. Heavenly Father sires spiritual children in heaven destined for human life on earth.  All humans, as well as Jesus Christ and Lucifer, are gods heavenly children.  Every human being has the potential of becoming a god by keeping the requirements of Mormonism.  The Morman plan of salvation is built on the idea that all people have eternal life, but only the most faithful Mormons have godhood or enter the celestial kingdom.  In order to obtain this ultimate step, Mormons must exercise faith in the God of Mormonism, its Christ, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; exercise repentence; and be baptisted in the LDS church.  Additionaly Mormons must keep the ""Word of Wisdom"" by abstaning from alcohol, tobacco, and caffiene; tithe to the church; attend weekly sacrament meetings; support the Mormon prophet; do temple works; and be active in their support of the Church.  \n\nIs this Christianity, I think not."

Dutch spectacle-makers Hans Janssen and his son Zacharias Janssen are often said to have invented the first compound microscope in 1590, but this was a declaration by Zacharias Janssen himself halfway through the 17th century. The date is certainly not likely, as it has been shown that Zacharias Janssen actually was born around 1590. Another favorite for the title of 'inventor of the microscope' was Galileo Galilei. He developed an occhiolino or compound microscope with a convex and a concave lens in 1609. Galilei´s microscope was celebrated in the ´Lynx academy´ founded by Federico Cesi in 1603. Francesco Stelluti´s drawing of three bees were part of pope Urban VIII´s seal, and count as the first microscopic figure published (see Stephen Jay Gould, The Lying stones of Marrakech, 2000). Christiaan Huygens, another Dutchman, developed a simple 2-lens ocular system in the late 1600's that was achromatically corrected and therefore a huge step forward in microscope development. The Huygens ocular is still being produced to this day, but suffers from a small field size, and the eye relief is uncomfortably close compared to modern widefield oculars.\n\nAnton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) is generally credited with bringing the microscope to the attention of biologists, even though simple magnifying lenses were already being produced in the 1500's, and the magnifying principle of water-filled glass bowls had been described by the Romans (Seneca). Van Leeuwenhoek's home-made microscopes were actually very small simple instruments with a single very strong lens. They were awkard in use but enabled van Leeuwenhoek to see highly detailed images, mainly because a single lens does not suffer the lens faults that are doubled or even multiplied when using several lenses in combination as in a compound microscope. It actually took about 150 years of optical development before the compound microscope was able to provide the same quality image as van Leeuwenhoek's simple microscopes. So although he was certainly a great microscopist, van Leeuwenhoek is, contrary to widespread claims, certainly not the inventor of the microscope."

OR, do you think social oder is more important than individual liberty.  for example: wath your telephone calls randomly (invading your privacy) in order to make society stable, detect crimes and terrorism more easy.   limit your free press (for instance, don't talk about this, don't talk about that) in order to stop any inflamming of feelings in society.  \nThank you","Social order without education, individual empowerment and individual thinking is a time bomb.\n\nUsually and educated, critically minded population will need much less social or legal support to create social cohesion.

Good question to know the answer to before digging into religion.\n\nReligious inspiration is inseparable from Faith! Though I like Schneb and all the answers he freely offers total strangers, a truly wonderful trait; I expect you will find even his answer unsatisfactory.  So I'll offer this...\n\nScripture is inspired by God.  ---By Faith---  You see, it's totally possible a person who never communicates with God to stumble upon a Bible and find it utterly ridiculous.  This is, I believe, because he is a natural (you know, naturalism, looking for only natural explanations to physical phenomenon) man who has never applied himself to study of the spiritual realm.  However, a person who takes the basic knowledge of God's existence which God gives every man and spends his life learning more about God will make very much use of Faith-the human means of communication with the divine.  In the end, of the two people, the natural and spiritual, the spiritual will be ""inspired"" or ""revealed"" to know much more than the natural will ""discover,"" because the spiritual will have learned how to commune with His creator, which he will continue to do throughout all eternity.\nSo, to summarize learn all you can in school.  Study all the hard sciences and make ""discoveries,"" but more importantly, spend much time in prayer, in nature, in scripture reading, and allow the Lord to ""reveal"" to you.  In the end your ""inspirations"" from God will be infinitely more valuable than your ""discoveries"" in nature.  \nOh, and don't worry, they won't be in disagreement in the end.

"2","Why do some fish normally live in freshwater and others in saltwater? How can some fish adapt to both?","","Fresh water creates a hypotonic environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms, whose cell walls will burst if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles,[2] while freshwater fishes excrete excess water via the kidney.[3] Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, some fishes have the ability to migrate between fresh water and sea water.\n\nAs with many aquatic animals, most fishes release their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. Some of the wastes diffuse through the gills into the surrounding water. Others are removed by the kidneys, excretory organs that filter wastes from the blood. Kidneys help fishes control the amount of ammonia in their bodies. Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of osmosis. In saltwater fish, the kidneys concentrate wastes and return as much water as possible back to the body. The reverse happens in freshwater fish, they tend to gain water continuously. The kidneys of freshwater fish are specially adapted to pump out large amounts of dilute urine. Some fishes have specially adapted kidneys that change their function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater"

"1","whats inri stand for on the cross?","","IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM\n\nSince anyone who would actually see the paintings of the Crucifixion in the Middle Ages (inside a Church) would then already be familiar with the phrase (in Latin), the painters all apparently chose to simplify their paintings by only including the initials of the four Latin words, I N R I. The early Church had also apparently used that abbreviation.\n\nLuke 23:38 also mentions the sign on the Cross, and he mentions that the sign was written in three languages, Greek, Latin and Hebrew. Scholars then chose to follow the wording presented in John, as it is more complete by including the reference to Nazareth, and as it might be presenting the Latin version of the text on the Cross. In all three languages the first word was Jesus, but since Greek and Hebrew don't use the letter J, His Name was spelled beginning with an I. The Roman (Latin) spelling followed that, (IESVS) even though their language included a J. The second word represented Nazareth, or Nazarene, N. The third word represented king, which in Latin (REX) begins with an R. The fourth word represented Jews, (IVDAEORVM) again spelled beginning with an I. You can see that the INRI then says ""Jesus Nazareth King Jews""."

"2","How are density, displacement, and bouyancy related\nbouyancy, and \ndisplacement related?","","Displacement refers to the volume of liquid or gas displaced by an object.\n\nDensity is the mass to volume ratio.  The more mass in a given space, the more dense it is.\n\nBuoyancy is the ratio of the mass of an object to the mass of the gas or liquid displaced by that object (or basically a comparison of two densities).  If the mass of the object is less than the mass it displaces, it is considered to be buoyant and tend to rise to the top of the gas or liquid (provided that there is gravity or centripetal force present).\n\nSo, an object that has a density greater than its surrounding will need to attached or put inside an object that is less dense than its surroundings to float.  An example might be a steel-hulled ship.  The steel by itself would not float on water.  But, because it creates a huge pocket of air (which is less dense than water), the overall mass of the ship is less than the mass of the water it displaces, which allows it to float."

They aren't really related, they were just given similar names based on their diet.  Red pandas were once considered to be relatives of the raccoon (Family Procyonidae not Mustelidae, those are skunks/weasels/otters, though they are in the same superfamily) but they are currently considered to be in a family of their own (Ailuridae).

"2","What are the weather conditions that makes it favorable for tornado's?","","In the US Midwest, tornadoes are usually formed when a cold, dry air mass moving south from Canada collides with a warm, moist air mass moving north from the Gulf of Mexico (or Baja California, or the Atlantic, or what have you). \nThis produces large thunderstorm clouds known as supercells, which can produce heavy rains, hail, and tornados. \nTornados are formed in areas of the supercell called mesocyclones; which draws air into the storm. When you hear meteorologists talk about the ""hook echo"" on the radar, they're pointing out the mesocyclone. The best simple explanation (so far) for why the tornado starts to rotate is the phenomenon of vertical wind sheer, where wind changes direction at different elevations.\nSo, if you have access to a weather radar; you can see hook echos like the one below. If you have a wind velocity view (some do, some don't), look for a large difference in wind speed and direction around that hook echo."

"2","Environment vs genetics and lung cancer.?","Are genetic traits the primary case of lung cancer or is it the envirement.\nDont go by what you have been told. Lets give it some serious thought","Environment is easily the primary cause of lung cancer.  I'm not even aware of any genetic disorders that are associated with lung cancer.\n\nSmoking is the primary cause of lung cancer.  Before smoking was common, lung cancer was exceedingly rare.  Back in the early 1900's (1904 I believe), a doctor in the US found a man with lung cancer, and he wrote to all of his doctor friends to gather them so that they could have a part in this ""once in a lifetime"" chance to see a lung cancer patient.\n\nI wish I could photograph some of my textbooks to show you the correlation between smoking and lung cancer.  \n\nThe main causes of lung cancer are smoking, asbestos inhalation, and radon inhalation.  Each of these works via a completely different mechanism.  Smoking works by causing mutations in DNA with chemical carcinogens.  Asbestos works by causing excessive proliferation of certain lung cells, which increases the chance of a transcription error.  Radon works by emmitting alpha radiation, which causes DNA mutations by breaking DNA strands.  Radon then half-lifes into polonium, which adheres to the cells in your lungs and continues to emit radiation, causing more damage.  All three of these mechanisms have only become important within the last century.  Smoking was not popular until the 1940's or so, asbestos was not used prior to the 1950-60's or so, and radon accumulation in homes was not a problem before a similar timeframe.\n\nThere is really no contest between environmental and heredity effects on lung cancer.  Before smoking, asbestos, and radon, there was virtually no lung cancer at all."

"2","What's the difference between 'incomplete dominance' and 'recombinant'?","in intermediate between the phenotype of individuals with homozygous for either allele. For ex. the cross between a red flower(C^R,C^R) and white flower (C^W,C^W), and the F^1 Generation is pick flower (C^R, C^W). The F^2 generation of breeding btw F^1 Generation shows that for every four (The ratio 1:2:1) There was one red flower, two pink, and one white. So, isn't this same as Recombinant (an off spring whose phenotype differs from that of the parents) Wtf!! That's the same as incomplete dominance! The the offspring (two pink flower) is different from either of their ""parents"" white, and red flower...So what IS the difference between these two?!","Incomplete dominance\nIn incomplete dominance (sometimes called partial dominance), a heterozygous genotype creates an intermediate phenotype. In this case, only one allele (usually the wild type) at the single locus is expressed, creating an intermediate phenotype. A cross of two intermediate phenotypes (= monohybrid heterozygotes)will result in the reappearance of both parent phenotypes and the intermediate phenotype.\nThe classic example of this is the colors of carnations.\n       R   R'\nR RR RR' \nR' RR' R'R' \nR is the allele for red pigment. R' is the allele for no pigment.\nThus, RR offspring make a lot of red pigment and appear red. R'R' offspring make no red pigment and appear white. RR' and R'R offspring make a little bit of red pigment and therefore appear pink.\nRecombinant\nThe term recombinant DNA refers to a new combination of DNA molecules that are not found together naturally. Although processes such as crossing over technically produce recombinant DNA, the term is generally reserved for DNA produced by joining molecules derived from different biological sources."

If you are not familiar with this, it is when you rub the mineral across a piece of unglazed porcelain plate or tile.\n\nIn a streak test the gold will leave behind a gold streak while pyrite will leave behind a black one. This works, trust me, I know. All you need is a piece of unglazed porcelain.\n\nYou said earlier about rubbing it across the skin. I have never seen this work however some cheap jewlery is made of pyrite & will leave the fingers, etc. black looking. That is after you wear it a while.\n\nGold is very dense for its size. Pyrite is not nearly as dense. You could do a density test by displacement in water but I assume from what you told me that the ""gold"" is in a matrix.\n\nPyrite is usually found as a mass of cubic crystals. Sometimes they take on the appearance of a nugget b/c the cubes are very tiny. Gold will not have these cubes.\n\nGold is sometimes found in quartz veins. If you have a chunk of quartz it is possible that there is some gold in there.\n\nGo with the streak test & let us know what happens.\n\n:)"

This would be the case if all planets revolved with a perfect 0 dgree axial tilt\n\nBut you have to consider the angle of the planets tilt - Earths is 23.5 degrees, and Uranus is a whopping 80 odd degrees. It also depends on where the planet is along its orbit - ie during british summer time we are tilted by our postion in orbit toward the sun,  - that is the North Pole is  angled more toward the sun. During winter - when we have traveled to the 'other side' of the sun the oposite is true - the pole is angled away from the sun."

Avoid short answers like ""much better"". I understand it can only be unscientific guesswork, but the question looks interesting for me nevertheless.","Prior to revelation at Sinai, there were no ethical/moral laws.  Each group of people were governed by their own God, pharoah, king, etc. and were at his/her/its mercy.  \nAfter revelation at Sinai, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for 40 years as they learned to live in ""freedom"" with God and His laws as a guide.  Since the Israelites had never lived in freedom, they were doomed to wander in the wilderness until their children became of age and were able to function as a free people under God, their king, in the promised land.\nIn the promised land, everyone was held accountable to God's law -- especially the leaders.  It was a duty and privilege for everyone to study Torah, learn the law, and to assure that everyone received equal treatment under God's law.  Because everyone studied the law, the Levites could not invent and change laws willy-nilly.  They were accountable to God just the same as the lowly sheperd.\nOver time, God's laws have been adopted by other nations and justice for all has prevailed in some countries.\nWithout the laws of the Torah, insane leaders could commit monstrous acts of violence and atrocities without consequences.  Men could kill women and children simply from a fit of anger.  Everyone would live in constant terror not knowing from where the next threat would come.\nIn essence, we owe our freedom from terror to the words of wisdom found in this wonderful book we call our Bible!  \nIn today's world of terrorism, it makes one wonder how those words have become so distorted."

"2","why does plants need water to surrive?","","Although water is required for photosynthesis the amount of water actually required is tiny, almost immeasurable even in large tree. In contrast a large tree will use hundreds of gallons of water every single day. More importantly a plant that is in the dark will die without water just as fast as a plant in full sunlight. Since photosynthesis can't occur in the dark we know that it can't be photosynthesis that  most of the water is required for.\n\nPlants need water for three main reasons, the first two are  exactly the same reasons that you need water. \n\n1) Water serves as the solvent for every chemcial reaction that makes up life. Without water life simply isn't possible because no chemical reactions assocaited with life can occur.\n\n2) Water is also essential for transporting nutrients around the plant, so minerals are taken from the soil to the leaves dissolved in water, and sugars are taken from the leaves to the roots dissolved in water.\n\n3) Plants use water to maintain their very shape. The cells themselves are held in shape by the pressure of the water inside them, like water-filled balloons. Without water the cells shrink and collapse, and we see this as the plant wilting. If the collapse goes to far t5he cells tear and that part of the plant dies."
"1","1st.Introduction for the CHRISTIANS about BIBLE?","IS ""BIBLE"" IN THE BIBLE ???\n____The Bible does not contain self-reference, that is, the word 'Bible' is not in the Bible. Nowhere does the Bible talk about itself. Some scriptures are sometimes pointed to in the Bible, say: Here where it talks about itself, but we have to look closely. 2nd Timothy 3:16 is the favourite which reads: “All scripture is inspired of God” and there are those who would say, here is where the Bible it talks about itself, it says it is inspired of God, all of it. But if you read the whole sentence, you read that this was a letter wrote by Paul to Timothy and the entire sentence says to Timothy: “Since you were a young man you have studied the holy scriptures, all scriptures inspired by God” and so on… When Timothy was a young man the New Testament did not exist, the only thing that stems he was talking about are scriptures – which are only a portion of the Bible - from before that time. It could not have meant the whole Bible.\n**PLEASE,give REASONABLE ARGUMENT","You are correct that the word Bible is not in the Bible.  I believe Bible is Latin for The Book.  Christian scripture that Paul was referencing was specific to the Old Testament because the New Testament didn't exist yet.  \n\nThe Old Testament become considered ""Bible"" when Jewish scholars selected the books to be included because of their consistency, historical accuracy, and spiritual quality. \n\nThe New Testament books included in the Bible were chosen by the early church around 300 A.D. for their consistency, historical accuracy, and spiritual quality as well.  \n\nIf you read the bible and compare it to other books that were not included by the Jewish or Christian scholars, i.e. the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, it will be easy to see why most of them were not included in the Bible."

"1","WHY OH WHY Do people blatantly throw their cigarettes butts down on the ground , sometimes right at your feet?","it is bewildering to me how people can still do this and how it is overlooked by the authorities . what do you think about this subject and what could I do as an Individual to inspire my government to stop these people from this micro toxic litter ( that is MOST disgusting ) ????","Probably for the same reasons people throw pop cans, beer cans, dirty diapers, food wrappers etc. on the ground..........because they are lazy or because there was no other place to put the cigarette butt. As far as the dangers involved in cigarette smoke, people have more to worry about as far as factory emissions and vehicle emissions than they do from a cigarette. Smoke rises! Go into a smoker's house and see where the stains from the cigarette smoke is found. It is found at the ceiling level. There are also more health risks from people urinating outside or pets urinating outside, than there are from a cigarette butt left on the ground. As far as the toxins from the cigarette leeching into the ground or getting into our water supply, the risks are far smaller than the chemicals that people use in their gardens and vehicles every day. I would be willing to bet that there are just as many beer cans and alcohol bottles thrown down on the ground each day as cigarette butts.  Look around and you will notice ALL the trash that is thrown down. It's disgusting no matter what the litter happens to be. Personally, I find it disgusting to see parents toss their child's dirty diaper onto the ground, just so they don't have to ride home in their car with the smelly diaper! They chose to have the child and anything that comes out of that child belongs to them! I hate when people allow their pets to roam around and use parks, other people's yards etc. for their bathroom. That is MOST disgusting!  I do have a concern about cigarette butts though, the cigarette butt can be toxic to children and animals, and a lit cigarette carries the danger of starting a fire. For those reasons I wish people wouldn't throw their cigarette butts on the ground and out their car windows. Littering of ANY kind is wrong and should carry a stiff fine. Unfortunately very few people who litter (any kind of litter) get caught. The reason it is overlooked by authorities is for the same reason other littering is overlooked. There just isn't enough manpower to deal with the situation. Police have more important things to deal with than drive around looking for litterbugs. I do think targeting one group of people for littering is wrong. If you want to protest against ALL littering that is fine, but to just have a problem with cigarette butts is ridiculous. The littering problem is not just cigarette butts. ALL littering needs to be stopped.\n\n\nResponse\n\nThank you Kenlas, I wasn't trying to say that there was no smoke down lower. People talk about the danger of second hand smoke even when they are outside. My point was that the little trail of smoke from a cigarette in comparison to everything the factories and vehicles spew out every day would not really be much of an issue. The majority of cigarette smoke rises almost immediately, leaving very little for others to be concerned about. I was using the ceiling in a smoker's house as an example of smoke rising. People want to believe that smoking and second hand smoke are the only causes of lung cancer, but researchers have NO way of proving that people who have never smoked developed lung cancer from second hand smoke. When they do their so called tests, they use HIGHLY concentrated amounts of cigarette smoke to try and prove their case. They know that the factories and vehicles spew out the same and worse toxins, in far larger quantities, than a cigarette, but because of the expense of forcing those two things to be made safer, they choose to ignore them for the most part and concentrate on a relatively small part of the population. Plus they can pass bills to outrageously raise taxes on cigarettes to help generate money whenever they need more money. I haven't seen them raising taxes on ALL alcohol to help generate more money, even though hundreds of people die due to drunk drivers each year. I don't see them banning alcohol in all public places to help reduce the amount"

"2","Do we need the moon?","what would happen if we had no moon and why do we only have one when other planets have more than one.","I swear I answer this question 4 or 5 times a week. \n\n1) Even without the moon we would still get tides. The tides are caused by both the sun and the moon equally. Solar tides would only be half as high as normal tides, and they would occur with a regular 12 hour rhythm rather than the monthly rhythm we get now.\n\n2) It would be almost impossible for complex life to survive without the moon. The moon locks the Earth into a stable position WRT the sun. As a result the equator always faces a the sun and the poles have always been perpendicular. Planets that lack large moons wobble, and at times the poles face the sun and the equator rotates perpendicular to the sun. At those times the temperature and light extremes would exterminate all complex life forms. \n\nWe don't know how long the Earth would remain in a perpendicular orientation  without the moon, but some time within the next half million years it would tip. When it did all surface life would die. Life would still be possible but every time the axis moved too far from perpendicular it would have to start afresh from deep sea bacteria.\n\n3) We have only one moon, and a very large moon, because it resulted from a collision AFTER the Earth had solidified. That collision tore off a huge chunk of the Earth and hurled it into orbit. In contrast the moons of other planets are either comets that have become trapped in orbit or were formed from the solar gas cloud BEFORE the planet itself formed.\n\nThe Earth's moon is unique in our solar system and is in no small part responsible for our evolution and continued existence."

"2","Distinguish between insulin and estrogen?","","estrogen is a sex hormone, functioning as the primary female sex hormone, while insulin is a polypeptide hormone that regulates carbohydrate metabolism.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\nEstrogens' (also oestrogens) are a group of steroid compounds, named for their importance in the oestrus cycle, functioning as the primary female sex hormone. While estrogens are present in both men and women, they are usually present at significantly higher levels in women of reproductive age. They promote the development of female secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts, and are also involved in the thickening of the endometrium and other aspects of regulating the menstrual cycle. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) regulate the production of estrogen in ovulating women. Since estrogen circulating in the blood can feedback to reduce circulating levels of FSH and LH, some oral contraceptives contain estrogens.\n\nThe three major naturally occurring estrogens in women are estradiol, estriol and estrone. In the body these are all produced from androgens through enzyme action. Estradiol is produced from testosterone and estrone from androstenedione. Estrone is weaker than estradiol, and in post-menopausal women more estrone is present than estradiol.\n\nInsulin: \n, ""island"", as it is produced in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas) is a polypeptide hormone that regulates carbohydrate metabolism. Apart from being the primary effector in carbohydrate homeostasis, it also has a substantial effect on small vessel muscle tone, controls storage and release of fat (triglycerides) and cellular uptake of both amino acids and some electrolytes. In this last sense, it has anabolic properties. Its concentration (more or less, presence or absence) has extremely widespread effects throughout the body.\n\nInsulin is used medically in some forms of diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus depend on exogenous insulin (injected subcutaneously) for their survival because of an absolute deficiency of the hormone; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have either relatively low insulin production or insulin resistance or both, and a non-trivial fraction of type 2 diabetics eventually require insulin administration when other medications become inadequate in controlling blood glucose levels.\n\nInsulin has the empirical formula C257H383N65O77S6.\n\nSo essentially, tho they are both hormones, they play very different roles. Also, insulin is not typcally realted to one gender, while estrogen is mainly a female hormone (and therefore has feminising abilities)\nHope that helps you!"
"2","a question from relativistic mechanics..........?","imagine that i am travelling in a car at such a speed so that 5 minutes for me are equivalent to 100 years for the rest of the world. then how much fuel will my car consume???  fuel required for 5 minutes or for 100 years???.... coz for others i was travelling for 100 years but according to me i just travelled for 5 minutes,....  i am eagerly waiting for the answer... GIVE A COMPLETE EXPLANATION please..","The answer is very simple: the same amount of fuel is required no matter which reference frame you're in. Because it only takes you 5 minutes to travel from point A to point B, your fuel consumption rate will be significantly higher in your reference frame (remember consumption rate = amount of fuel burned/time) than someone measuring the rate in a stationary reference frame. The key points to remember is that total amount of matter and energy is the same no matter what reference frame you're in, but the passage of time is relative, and is dependent on your speed of motion.\n\nSo before you start your trip back to Earth, you must carry enough fuel to burn for 5 minutes, but you'll need to account for the relativistic effect, so you'll find that it is the same amount of fuel you'll need to burn for 100 years, according to someone in the stationary reference frame.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify these concepts for you!"

"2","Why do we apply tin coating over brass?","","It is to stop reactions with organic products when cooking food. Brass is the term used for alloys of copper and zinc in a solid solution. It is more than 50% copper and from 5 to 20% zinc, in comparison to bronze which is principally an alloy of copper and tin. The copper in the alloy reacts with organic acids in the foodstuffs that can lead to food poisoning. The tin stops that from happening."

"2","if an ACh receptor is permanently blocked can external electrodes stimulate a contraction?","","I believe the external stimulation would trigger a contraction.  I am basing that on the fact that the muscle fibers are stimulated directly by the electrical current\nfrom the voltage source.\n\nRecruitment of fibers occurs opposite the standard.  Type II, fast twitch fibers, are recruited first and Type I, slow twitch, are second.  Normally the pattern is Type I then Type II when needed.\n\nThe change in charge at the muscle, which is a great conductor of electricity, causes the Ca++ release normally triggered by ACh or another neurotransmitter.\n\nCouldn't find a source to back me up, try an advanced physiology textbook. I did find this link below that has similar information."

"2","How does pitch (as in pitch you put on boats to keep them afloat) burn?","I know pitch does burn, but how does it burn?  Does it burn like an engulfing flame similar to gasoline, or is it just very hard to put out once it is on fire similar to oil?  Any insight would be appreciated.","Pitch that has been used for centuries (the ancient Greek and Romans used it and I am sure it was used before) is nothing more than tar.  The ancients probably found it in tar pit.  Tar is a petroleum product (basically it's like solidified crude oil).  As a result it will burn, not explosively but being a petroleum product once it gets going as in a fire ones going to have a heck of a time putting it out.  \n\nArchimedes was supposed to have invented a solar ray to aim at the Roman fleets to set the pitch on fire.  \n\nMythbusters did an episode on this one and concluded it would have been improbable, yet many still believe this story.\n\nI suspect because it is so flammable that today (unless one is making a replica of an older boat) it is not still used.

"2","What is the most important hormone involved in water balance?","","Hormone Control of Water and Salt \nWater reabsorption is controlled by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in negative feedback. ADH is released from the pituitary gland in the brain. Dropping levels of fluid in the blood signal the hypothalamus to cause the pituitary to release ADH into the blood. ADH acts to increase water absorption in the kidneys. This puts more water back in the blood, increasing the concentration of the urine. When too much fluid is present in the blood, sensors in the heart signal the hypothalamus to cause a reduction of the amounts of ADH in the blood. This increases the amount of water absorbed by the kidneys, producing large quantities of a more dilute urine.\n\nAldosterone, a hormone secreted by the kidneys, regulates the transfer of sodium from the nephron to the blood. When sodium levels in the blood fall, aldosterone is released into the blood, causing more sodium to pass from the nephron to the blood. This causes water to flow into the blood by osmosis. Renin is released into the blood to control aldosterone."

If you don't tell her, it could be something that you will regret and will eat away at you, and from what you have said it is already really bothering you. Even though it could alter your friendship, you can't keep acting that you are only interested in her as a friend.

"2","How does a sedimentary rock become a metamorphic rock?","","Any rock (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic) can become a metamorphic rock. If rocks are buried deep in the Earth at high temperatures and pressures, they form new minerals and textures all without melting. If melting occurs, magma is formed, starting the rock cycle all over again. \nGeologists can learn the following about the Earth from the study of metamorphic rocks: \n\nthe temperature and pressure conditions (metamorphic environment) in which the rock was formed \nthe composition of the parent, or original unmetamorphosed, rock. \naids in the interpretation of the platetectonic setting in which the metamorphism took place \naids in the reconstruction of the geological history of an area. \nThe term ""metamorphic"" means ""to change form."" Changes in the temperature and pressure conditions cause the minerals in the rock to become unstable so they either reorient themselves into layers (foliation) or recrystallize into larger crystals, all without undergoing melting."

"2","Why do we always see the same side of the moon from earth?","","The earth exerts a powerful gravitational attraction for the moon (the moon also exerts a similar but lesser attraction for the earth that raises tides both in the ocean and to a lesser extent in the earth's crust that move about the earth as it spins).  The earth's attraction has raised a bulge in the moon facing earth that is therefore slightly closer to the earth and more strongly attracted.  If a huge meteor struck the moon (as in the past) trying to rotate it, it would have to overcome the earth's attraction for the bulge; thus the moon always faces its bulge toward the earth.  If the moon did spin at one time, the bulge would have helped arrest the motion relative to earth as it deleloped and froze solid."

"2","Frogs can be frozen, then unfrozen?","And they're still alive???\nReally?","The common wood frog freezes solid every winter and then, come spring, defrosts and mates. \n\nFrogs that survive freezing excite our imagination with visions of immortality. Underlining this excitement is the unexpected: our experience tells us that freezing kills. We've all read news stories of people who have lost fingers or toes to extreme cold, or even their lives. Thus, a whole animal that can survive freezing comes as a shock. Yet during the past two decades we have also read or even experienced the successes of in vitro fertilization, which involves the routine storage of sperm and embryos in a frozen state at cryogenic temperatures (-40°F or lower). So why is the survival of a frozen frog at 26°F surprising? \n\nThoroughly confused? You should be. Freezing has a yin-yang effect on biological materials—it can both preserve and destroy tissue. This paradoxical nature has led to two different fields of science and medicine built around freezing: cryopreservation and cryosurgery.\n\nSurviving the deep freeze\nLife is a complex set of electrochemical reactions. The rate at which chemical reactions take place depends on temperature, and usually the lower the temperature the lower the rate. At absolute zero Kelvin (-460°F), the rate is zero. Therefore, lowering the temperature of biological materials such as cells, organs, or entire organisms to absolute zero causes life to stop indefinitely. If a person or his or her body parts could survive the excursion to absolute zero and back, scientists and physicians could theoretically use such freezing as a vehicle to transport that person or parts to any point in the future. \n\nBecause we humans are mostly water, however, any journey into the supercool is physically traumatic. At about 31°F, the water in our bodies begins to freeze. It starts at this temperature (rather than 32°F) because biological water is in the form of a solution, mainly of ions or charged atoms. The survival of any cells during freezing depends at minimum on the rate the temperature changes. For most organisms, even the slowest cooling results in an assault on their cells that is just too great.\n\nResulting cell damage is related to the dissolved substances or solutes in biological water, to the cell membrane properties, and to the fact that ice has a very tight crystallographic structure and cannot contain solutes. When biological materials freeze, the solution between cells usually freezes first. Solutes found in the original solution are ejected and concentrated in the unfrozen space between the ice crystals. Cells usually remain unfrozen though supercooled.\n\nIn order to balance out the resulting difference in potential energy between the inside and outside of the cell, water leaves the cell through the cell membrane. Inside the cell, this loss of water causes an increase in the ionic concentration and leads to chemical damage. Interestingly, ions, not ice crystals, trigger cell injury during freezing. Theoretically, an infinitely fast rate to absolute zero would eliminate this harm. This is not possible, of course, and at higher cooling rates the supercooling of water in cells causes ice to form within those cells, which also brings about damage.\n\nNatural antifreezes\nCells in freeze-tolerant wood frogs experience the same mechanism of freezing injury as any other creatures' cells. The frogs freeze very slowly to a temperature often several degrees below freezing. This should destroy the frog's cells, yet those cells and the frog as a whole survive. How? A primary mechanism is through the production of glucose and its incorporation in the frog's cell. By lowering the amount of water that leaves the cell during freezing, the glucose offers protection against the rise in ionic concentration and excessive cell shrinkage, thereby reducing chemical harm.\n\nWhile the wood frog spent millions of years perfecting the use of such chemicals, scientists in the field of cryobiology disco"

"2","How and why do magnets attract? What kinds?","Im doing a project on magnets and i couldnt really find any USEFUL information on why magnets attract. HELP ME PLEASE? it would really help and i would appreciate it =)","Why do magnets work? \nMagnetism is an invisible force felt within the space around a magnet.  This space, called the magnetic field, can either attract (pull) or repel (push away) other magnets and some types of metal.\n\nAll magnets have two ends (poles).  These poles are opposites and are called the north and south poles.  Opposite poles attract, while like (similar) poles, repel.\n\nThe Earth’s core has its own magnetic field.  Magnetic north and south are near the geographic north and south poles.\n\nNASA has been experimenting with magnetic fluids for over 30 years. Magnetic fluids were made to help put fuel into a rocket engine. NASA was trying to solve the problem. of how to move fuel without gravity.  Tiny pieces of iron were put into the fuel. A magnet pulls the iron and could help get the fuel into the engine.\n\nMagnetic fluids are made by mixing pieces of metal in liquids to make a fluid that is very different from other liquids. It will stick to a magnet and can be directed by magnetic forces. Magnetic fields can shape the fluid, and magnetic fluids can change their thickness. They become hard around magnets.\n\nScientists have tried to use magnetic fluids to solve other problems. They’re used to make better computers. Scientists are still thinking of new ways to use the fluids.\n\nYou may use magnetic fluids!  Some cars have them in their shock absorbers. They are used in some buildings and bridges. The fluids help protect structures from damage from earthquakes or strong winds. There is still a lot to learn about these magnetic fluids. NASA is using the Space Station to learn more about them.

"1","Why do ppl not believe in God because of the past?","I mean my parents are divorced, i was molested, my dad wants nothing to do with me, my mom was with an abusive boyfriend for 8 years and she almost died and had to have brain surgary and after all that i still found God and believe in him with all my heart.","There are of course many reasons why people choose to deny God. (I'm going to assume we are specifically referring to the God of the Christian/Jewish Bible).\n\nNow I realize that the reasons people choose to deny God not only depends on age, sex, and race, but also on the era and culture they grow up in. I will list some of the more practical and common reasons why I personally believe people today deny God referring specifically to people in America.\n\n1. Most people just don't care. It's true, most people don't care about the issue of God. They care more about their current needs and problems such as earning money, feeding their children, and surviving. So these types of people don't really care about belief in God because they don't see how having that ""belief"" will put food on the table.\n\n2. A lot of people grew up in traditional Catholic homes where the parents were harsh and strict and beat ""religion"" into their kids (not physically) and sternly commanded strict adherence to ""no sex,"" ""go to Church,"" ""do this and don't do that."" Of course when the children got old enough they completely rebelled, ditched Church, immediately started having lots of sex, hated religion, and cared only about the pleasures of this life. A further problem is that the parents teach the children to adhere and practice certain traditions without telling the children the meaning or importance of them. Naturally the children grow up believing these Church traditions are meaningless and useless and are angry that they had to follow them when they were younger. These types of people have felt “repressed” by religion for so long that they want little or nothing to do with it.\n\n3. Self-denial and the art of philosophy. A lot of people whether consciously or subconsciously deny that God exists and use lots of excuses to validate their denial. This is of course the position the NT holds in reference to how people willfully choose to deny God even though He clearly manifests Himself in the things that are seen (the intricate order of the universe, earth, life itself). They may choose to deny God by claiming that, “nothing is real,” “nothing can be proven,” “we can’t really tell if we even exist,” etc. You get the idea. Before anyone believes in God, for one reason or another they fall into this category, meaning that everyone has “inwardly” chosen rebellion and denial of God when we truly “know better.” This position only makes sense to those that are believers. These types of people deny God’s existence based on the fact that since we can never truly know what’s real or not, then nothing truly matters, including God.\n\n4. Sin is fun. If it wasn't people wouldn't do it. People like the temporary (and fleeting) high of sin. They of course gloss over and choose to deny the inevitable consequences (death, suffering, pain, etc.). But regardless, sin is quite tempting and it pays off (if only temporarily) and believing in God would mean they'd have to stop. Who would want to do that? These types of people reject God because everything He’s against feels too good to give up.\n\n5. Pop-culture. ""Rational,"" ""civilized,"" and ""educated"" minds have persuaded our culture, which inevitably persuaded our media, (which in turn persuaded our culture even more), that there is no absolute right or wrong, and that all of us are free to do what we ""feel"" is right and wrong. Once you take away absolute right and wrong God becomes a rather huge contradiction, and no one likes believing in a contradiction. Many religions are seen as “intolerant” and therefore are “narrow-minded.” If there are no absolutes, then God is not ""the"" truth. All religions are “up-for-grabs,” anything can be believed in whether it be paganism, the occult, philosophy, humanism, etc. Anything can be the truth, and th"
"2","does heating basement  rid dampness as well as a dehumidifier?","","It may depend on the source and use of heat.  An electric heater would heat the air locally permitting the air to hold more moisture while perhaps drying some surfaces, but would not remove any moisture.  An existing circulation air heating system placed into service by opening duct vents would supply new dry air forcing moist air to move on perhaps returning to the furnace.  The basement may be damp because moisture penetrates the walls (possibly through cracks).  Therefore a dehumidifier or a central heating system may perform equally well compared to an electric heater unless the electrically heated warmed air is free to leave the area (perhaps rising up the stairs?)."
"2","If light is slowed... will it change from energy to mass?","Though according to theory of relativity.. light is constant and cannot be speeded or slowed...this question is purely theoretical...","When the light speeds up it gains mass, so it should loose mass when it slows down.\n\nSo you are right. Light has zero rest mass. So it will be as if it was non existant when its at rest. But we know when light hits any other particles it converts to energy and reveals its presense ( We humans also detect light with eyes, but its similar process of how objects get hot in summer with light ).\n\nNewton's Corpslcular theory can be very good classical explantion of mass/energy relation of light if every were normal classical photon. But we all know that Newton was wrong, and light will not change its direction slowly to conserve energy, but when it hits any smooth surface it retracts immediately. So its velocity at that point of hitting is zero for very very very short periods of time, and again its back to light speed. So your question does not have a classical or quantum explantion, but reltivity theory can be used to understand it."

Does he killed ?\n How he killed if he is the god? who his father is ?\nif he is the son of God why he is a human?\nmany question ?!!\nwhat is the clear story ????????","Jesus (8-2 BC/BCE– 29-36 AD/CE),[1] also known as Jesus of Nazareth, is the central figure of Christianity. In this context, he is known as Jesus Christ, where Christ is a Greek title meaning ""Anointed"", corresponding to the Hebrew term ""Messiah"".\n\nThe main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Most scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that Jesus was a Jewish teacher from Galilee who was regarded as a healer, was baptized by John the Baptist, was accused of sedition against the Roman Empire, and on the orders of Roman Governor Pontius Pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion.[2] As the Gospels were not written immediately after his death and there is little external documentation, a small minority of scholars question the historical existence of Jesus.[3]\n\nChristian views of Jesus (known as Christology) are both diverse and complex. Most Christians are Trinitarian and believe that Jesus is simultaneously the Son of God and God made incarnate, sent to provide salvation and reconciliation with God by atoning for the sins of humanity. Nontrinitarian Christians adopt various other interpretations regarding the divinity of Jesus. Most Christians believe that Jesus was born of a virgin, crucified and buried in a tomb[4], resurrected on the third day of death, and ascended into Heaven where he resides with God the Father until the Second Coming. Most Christians also believe that Jesus performed miracles and fulfilled biblical prophecy.\n\nIn Islam, Jesus (Arabic Isa) is considered one of God's most beloved and important prophets, a bringer of divine scripture, and also the Messiah. Muslims, however, do not share the Christian belief in the crucifixion or divinity of Jesus. Islam teaches that Jesus is alive in heaven and will return to the earth as Messiah in the company of the Mahdi once the earth has become full of sin and injustice.\n\nThe most detailed accounts of Jesus' birth are contained in the Gospel of Matthew (probably written between 65 and 90 AD/CE)[5] and the Gospel of Luke (probably written between 65 and 100 AD/CE).[6] There is considerable debate about the details of Jesus' birth even among Christian scholars, and few scholars claim to know either the year or the date of his birth or of his death. Based on the accounts in the Gospels of the shepherds' activities, the time of year depicted for Jesus' birth could be spring or summer. However, as early as 354, according to Origen, Roman Christians celebrated it following the December solstice in an attempt to replace the Roman festival of Saturnalia (or more specifically, Sol Invictus). Before then, Jesus' birth was generally celebrated on January 6 as part of the feast of Theophany, also known as Epiphany, which commemorated not only Jesus' birth but also his baptism by John in the Jordan River and possibly additional events in Jesus' life. The traditional date of Jesus' birth is celebrated as Christmas.\n\nIn the 248th year of the Diocletian Era (based on Diocletian's ascension to the Roman throne), Dionysius Exiguus attempted to pinpoint the number of years since Jesus' birth, arriving at a figure of 753 years after the founding of Rome. Dionysius then set Jesus' birth as being December 25 1 ACN (for ""Ante Christum Natum"", or ""before the birth of Christ""), and assigned AD 1 to the following year — thereby establishing the system of numbering years from the birth of Jesus: Anno Domini (which translates as ""in the year of our Lord""). This system made the then current year 532, and almost two centuries later it won acceptance and became the established calendar in Western civilization due to its championing by the Venerable Bede.\n\nHowever, based on a lunar eclipse that Josephus reports shortly before the death of Herod the Great (w"

"2","Which has a higher probability rate in a 52 card deck:  being  dealt 4 of a kind in succession or alternation?","Their is an arbitrary shuffle.  Successive is as it implies: being dealt  four cards in a row.  Alternating means one down, and then one to you. If it eases results, we are referring to the first four cards to be dealt in the Successive dealing and the first 8 in Alternating.  I've been pondering this question assuming a simple answer but I haven't reached a conclusion to date.  If you are going to answer it for points please write something ridiculous to make me laugh.  I'd prefer humor over the words ""Succession"" or  ""Alternation.""","Think of the probability of picking 4 cards from somewhere in the deck and finding them all the same... it would be something like (52/52 x 3/51 x 2/50 x 1/49).  But whatever it is, it doesn't matter.  Just call this probability p.  Now does it matter where you draw the cards from?  If I were to pick the first 4 cards, the last 4 cards, a random collection of cards, alternating cards, etc. will the results be any different?  No, the probability is always the same probability p.\n\nIt's the same with the lottery.  While the sequence 1,2,3,4,5 might seem less likely to occur than something like 13, 17, 26, 37, 42, they actually have the same probability.\n\nHowever, you may notice that dealers always deal one card to each player, then repeat.  They don't deal 5 cards to one, then 5 cards to another, etc.  The reason has nothing to do with probability and everything to do with preventing cheating. It's much easier to perhaps keep a set of cards together while shuffling (with false shuffles, palming, etc.) and then make sure they get placed at the top of the deck.  Then if you dealt them to one person, they'd get all the desirable cards.  However, if you have to alternate, then it is near impossible to arrange the cards so that one person gets the desirable cards."

However, although the ocean contains 1,370 million cubic kilometres (334 million cubic miles) of water, humans can’t survive by drinking from it—it is too salty.\n\nTo a chemist, ‘salt’ refers to a wide range of chemicals where a metal is combined with a non-metal. Ordinary common salt is a compound formed when the metal sodium combines with the non-metal chlorine—sodium chloride. This contains electrically charged atoms, called ions, that attract each other, resulting in a fairly hard crystal. When salt dissolves, these ions separate. Sodium and chloride ions are the main ions in seawater, but not the only ones. The salty seas benefit man, because the ocean provides many useful minerals for our industries."

However, human eyes see 3D because there is space between the eyes and the two views are therefore slightly different, especially for nearby objects.  You can ""see"" 3D using arial photography if two pictures are take in rapid succession from the airplane with enough separation to simulate the space between eyes.  The space must be much greater for the airplane because the objects on the ground are far away from the camera lense.  Set the photos side by side with a vertical sheet (of cardboard?) between them and look down on the photos using both eyes.  If the size of the photos and placement are correct so that your eyes now simulate the airplane, you may be able to fuse the images into 3D.  Often special equipment (and lenses?) are used to facilitate the process.  Good luck."

And the rate of change of the area under a curve is actually the original function.\n\n\nLet's say you have a simple curve, y=f(x).\n\nThe derivative of the function is gives you the rate of change of that function.  As x increases by 1, how much does y change?  That's also known as the slope.\n\n[And you probably know that the derivative of the derivative is also useful.  That's the rate of change of the slope.  When the slope stops changing (or its rate of change=0), it's at a maximum, minimum, or point of inflection.]\n\nThe same relationship exists for the area under a curve and the function itself.  You probably learned to think of the integral of f(x) as the sum of the thin vertical strips under the curve.  That's the area under the curve.  As you move to the right, how fast does the area grow?  You're essentially adding these vertical strips to the area.  The length of a vertical strip is f(x), or the original function.  So the original function f(x) represents how fast the area grows for any value x.\n\n\nETA: What do I have to do to get selected as best answer?"

The way you handle this varies on your friendship with her. It will not be easy, particularly if you covered for her in the past.

"1","are we all reincarnated, or are some of us 'new' souls?","","Most answers to this type of question are based on belief but there are a few ""Master"" enlightened beings that claim to actually know the answers.  So based on what I've read and come to believe all ""souls"" come from an unconscious God state and are actually an individual mind of God on a journey of consciousness veiled by the bubble of illusion (our existence).  This is a continuous, infinite process from what I understand.  Meaning ""new souls"" are continually coming from the original God state.  The individual ""soul"" goes through the process of evolution of forms until it reaches the human form.  So there are some humans that have never been human before but they have had millions of life times and probably in their last life they were a dog.  Then the ""soul"" goes through the process of reincarnation of human forms because of karmic debt, etc."
"2","How do astrophysicists calculate the exact distance of other celestial objects from earth?","","There are three basic methods:\n\n1. Parallax. The angle at which the object appears in the sky is very precisely measured at one point in the Earth's orbit, then measured again six months later. Since the Earth is in a different position at these times (186 million miles between the two measurments), the star will appear at slightly different angles, and its distance can then be worked out from these angles using simple trigonometry.\n\n2. Standard candles. Certain types of stars (Cepheid variables, RR lyrae variables), and certain types of stellar events (type Ia supernovae), have luminosities that can be worked out fairly precisely from their intrinsic properties (the variable stars for instance, have a period of variablility that is closely correlated with their luminosity, and the type Ia's luminosity can be worked out by examining its light curve). Since percieved luminosity varies inversely with the square of the distance, and since we konw how much light they put out at the source, we can work out how far away these stars are simply by measuring how bright they are.\n\n3. Redshift. The universe is expanding, and that means that from our perspective, distant galaxies are all moving away from us. This means that the light we recieve from them will be at a lower frequency (that is, redder) than the light they emitted, due to the doppler effect. Edwin hubble discovered that at large scales, the observed redshift is directly proportional to the distance of the object from us. This means that if the object is too far away to measure using parallax and lacks a good standard candle, we can still determine its distance simply by measuring its velocity. Actually doing this is somewhat difficult, and involves looking for patterns in the absorption lines in the object's spectrum to figure out what elements created those lines, and then one you know that you can figure out what the frequency of the light should be. After that, you have to work to filter out as many extraneous sources of redshift as possible, such as the object's gravity, its velocity due to gravitational interactions with other nearby objects (what is called the peculiar velocity), and so forth, to leave just the velocity due to the expansion of the universe - from which the distance is estimated using hubble's law."

"1","what are the names of the leaders in world war 2?","eg: Hitler,Churchill","Adolf Hitler - Nazi dictator of Germany (1933-45), planned and started World War 2, committed suicide at the end of the war. \nGeneral Hideki Tojo - Prime minister of Japan (October 1941 - July 1944). With a long militarist tradition, Japan became extremely militarist and aggressive in the 1930s and was practically governed by military leaders. Tojo, an aggressive army General, became minister of war in July 1941 and prime minister in October 1941. After a short attempt to improve relations with the US failed, he ordered to go to war and attack Pearl Harbor in December 1941. He gradually took more ministerial roles, and in Feb. 1944 also made himself the commander in chief, like Adolf Hitler did. When he realized that Japan was going to lose the war he resigned. The military continued to control Japan until the end of World War 2, which came when the Emperor Hirohito which was until then passive, ordered to surrender in order to prevent further inevitable destruction of Japan. After the war Tojo was executed for his responsibility to Japan's war crimes. \nBenito Mussolini, was the prime minister of Italy (1922-1943). A former journalist, he went to politics and formed the Fascist party, whose ideology, Fascism, called for a one-party state, total obedience, patriotic nationalism, and aggressive militarism. The ideology and its implementation in Mussolini's Italy influenced Adolf Hitler's own ideology, Nazism, which was a combination of Fascism with extreme racism. Initially Mussolini led a right-wing coalition, but later Italy became a one party state. His treatment of unemployment made Mussolini popular, but the military aggression of Fascism led to its failure. Mussolini was eager to demonstrate the ""strength"" of his regime by invading weaker neighbors. In 1935 he invaded and occupied the peaceful Ethiopia from Italy's nearby colony in East Africa. In 1936, the two Fascist dictators, Hitler and Mussolini, signed an alliance. In 1939 he invaded and occupied his small neighbor Albania, and Mussolini then enhanced his alliance with Hitler to a full military alliance. Mussolini knew that his military was not very effective, but when the Germans defeated the French and British forces in mid 1940 he thought it was safe enough for him to attack Britain and the collapsing France too and declared war, and in October 1940 he also invaded Greece, and was repelled. Mussolini had a million soldiers in Libya, and he sent them to attack the small British force in Egypt. The Italian Navy and Air Force attacked British ports and shipping in the Mediterranean, from Gibraltar in the West to Haifa (Israel) in the East. Despite its numerical strength and the fact that British forces in the Mediterranean were greatly outnumbered and very stretched, the Italian military could not defeat them anywhere, and was severely beaten by the British, and simply had to call for the help of the much more capable Germans. Even with German help, the British forces only lost their positions in Greece and kept fighting fiercely from their island bases in Malta, Gibraltar, and in North Africa. Mussolini's Italy became a German puppet, and even sent troops to participate in Germany's invasion of Russia. Eventually, British and American forces eliminated the Italian and German forces in North Africa and followed in July 1943 with an invasion of Sicily in South Italy. It was clear that Italy was losing the war, so several days after the invasion Mussolini was replaced and arrested in a remote mountain castle. Hitler sent commandos to rescue his friend from captivity. In April 1945, when German defence in North Italy collapsed, Mussolini was captured by Italian partisans and executed . \nThe defenders\nWinston Churchill kept warning of the Nazi danger in pre-war years.

Could astronauts last that long in flight and have enough room for provisions? Would this ever be possible? How fast would the space capsule have to be traveling? I know we have landed several unmanned spacecraft, but each trip was one way only.","Yes, we have the technology to do this now.  What's holding us back is the cost, not the tech.\n\nThe trip would be about six months each way using the engines we have now and gravity assists where possible.  The most likely scenario would be to first launch a series of un-manned ""provision"" ships to land on Mars or perhaps orbit it -- these would contain food, water, and fuel.  Once we had verified that they were safely at their destination, we would launch the manned ship -- which would carry enough provisions for a one-way trip, and upon arrival at Mars re-stock from the earlier unmanned ships and then return to Earth.  \nWe *could* fully provision a ship for a round-trip, but doing so makes the manned craft much larger and expensive, and lacks the backup of additional supplies existing at the destination.\n\nAll of this is already on NASA's drawing boards, though whether it will ever happen or not is completely a matter of $$ :)"

So set up a row of fractions multiplied together to get your units to cancel the way you want them to.  We're looking for square yards, so start there.  Square yard is yard*yard\n\n1yard/3feet * 1yard/3feet * 240feet*feet --> the feet cancel in the top and bottom and you are left with square yards for the units.  Now to multiply the numbers:  240/(3*3)=26.67 sq yards.\n\nNow using the same method, you can find total price.\n\n$8.91/sq yd * 26.67 sq yd.

"2","What is the maximum thickness of an oxide layer for quantum tunneling (josephson effect) to still be viable?","","honestly, it all depends on a lot of specifics.  any kind of tunneling effect comes about because of the exponential decay of the wavefunction into the energy-forbidden area.  since an exponential tail has a finite value even way out at 100 meters, that means any barrier thickness will still have tunneling across the gap.\n\nyou probably need to figure out what kind of measuring device you will be using (picoammeter?  what kind of noise?) and what junction materials you're talking about.  the specifics matter.  however, i think typical josephson junction barriers are around 1nm or so."
"2","If the Moon woudln't exist, life on  Earth would have been possible?","It's said that Moon avoided that EArth suffered hundreds of meteorites impacts and helped the life on Earth.","How would earth-without-a-moon differ from the earth we know? Some of the changes are obvious: nights would be darker, and tides would be lower (but not nonexistent; the sun's gravitational pull on the earth would still generate tides, though they would only be about a third as high as those created by the moon and the sun together). Other changes are more surprising: over time, the moon's tidal drag has acted as a brake on the earth's rotation; without it, Comins estimates, the earth would spin as much as three times faster, so that a year on earth-without-a-moon would consist of 1,095 eight-hour days. This faster spin would in turn result in near-constant hurricane-force east-to-west winds. The increased sloshing of the earth's molten core would generate a stronger magnetic field, deflecting more of the solar wind and possibly altering the chemistry of the earth's atmosphere."
"2","tangent line of an ellipse!?","find tangent line of ellipse x^2+4y^2=5 at (-5,0) and find (x1,y1) where the tangent line intersects the ellipse!","Use implicit differentiation to find dy/dx. Standard differentiation rules apply, except when you differentiate a term with a ""y"" in it you must tack on a dy/dx, so:\n\n2x+8y(dy/dx)=0\ndy/dx = -x/4y\n\nThe tangent line intersects the ellipse at (x1,y1), so the slope of the tangent line will be -x1/(4*y1).\n\nWe can also compute the slope of the tangent line by plugging the two points (-5,0) and (x1,y1) into the standard slope formula m = delta(y)/delta(x) and get that the slope of the tangent line is y1/(x1+5). Since these expressions both describe the slope of the tangent line, they must be equal, so\n-x1/(4*y1)=y1/(x1+5)\nx1^2+5*x1=-4*y1^2\nx1^2+4*y1^2+5*x1=0\n\nSince (x1,y1) is a point on the ellipse, it must satisfy the equation of the ellipse, so x1^2+4*y1^2=5. Substituting this in to x1^2+4*y1^2+5*x1=0 gives us 5+5*x1=0, and x1=-1. At this point, there are actually two y1 values that will satisfy the equation of the ellipse, y1 could be either plus or minus 1 (get these by letting x=-1 in the original equation of the ellipse), and so there are actually two points on the ellipse where the tangent line passes through (-5,0), and those points are (-1,1) and (-1,-1)."

"1","Is this adultery?","if I often think about having sex with my engaged one... we never do it-- we're saving it for marriage. It doesn't feel wrong when I think about it, but I just wondered if it was adulterous. Please be practical if you are going to use theology. Thanks.","Jesus said that to look after a woman to lust you've already committed adultery with her in your heart.  The point of this is that Christ is more interested in what we are rather than what we do.  In other words, if its wrong to do a particular thing, it is wrong to fantasize about doing it, because whatever is in a person's  heart is what will flow out of him or her and defines him or her.  The practical side of this is, God knows how strong sexual desires are.  They have th power to drown out everything else.  They can reach a fever pitch almost instantly.  However, they are the weakest of all the qualities in a relationship to hold it together through the trials of life and ultimately, old age, sickness, and death.  That's why you need to cool the flame of sexual energy to allow the foundation to form that will carry you two together for life; love him for the person he is, the friend that he is.  Let sex (after marriage) spring from a beautiful union that has already grown and matured and as a special bonus.  God came up with the idea of sex, but He hates to see a great thing spoiled.  That's why He has rules for things; not to kill our fun, but for our good.  If sex is the foundation it will wither away.  Lastly, give your heart to Christ (if you haven't already) and call out His name for help when this becomes impossible because you can't do this in your own strength."

In actuality, nowhere is the bible is ""Alpha and Omega"" mentioned as dying.\n\nThe oldest Greek manuscripts, such as Alexandrine, Sinaitic, and Codex Ephraemi rescriptus, show that the KJV's use of the term at Revelation 1:11 is spurious. A small handful of other translations dishonestly insert the name ""Jesus"" at Rev 22:12 or Rev 22:13 but secular scholars unanimously agree that the most reliable ancient manuscripts never had Jesus' name there. Revelation 22:13 discussed Jehovah the Father.\n\nIn contrast to the Greek philosophy, pagan tradition, dishonest scholarship, and tortured ""logic"" of trinitarianism, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Scriptures alone quite plainly demonstrate that Jesus and the Almighty are separate distinct persons, and the Almighty created Jesus as His firstborn son.\n\n(Colossians 1:15) the firstborn of all creation\n\n(Mark 10:18) Jesus said to him: 'Why do you call me good?

Evolution has ZERO faith and ALL evidence.\n\nScientists (real ones) have been studying and supporting evolution for over 150 years, and still nothing has pointed to creationism. There is clear links and transitional forms between everything in the fossil record to the Class-Family level, if not Genus-Species level. And this includes humans, which there are several 'missing links' which are well described and studied, people just choose to ignore this. Sure, there are still things we don't know, but that's why science is not stagnent and dead. We learn more every day, that's what happens when you keep an open mind and follow the scientific method.\n\nThere are some areas of evolution in which all of the pieces have not been found in the fossil record, but there is no counter theory that has even ONE piece of evidence that can not easily be explained by evolution.\n\nLet me turn the question around, if Creationism was correct and science could definitively prove Creationism (and thus the existence of God), why would they not? That would be the greatest scientific discovery in the history of the world. No one would pass that up to maintain the 'status quo'. There is no conspiracy to hide creation evidence. Anyone who knows real scientists knows they are glory-mongers first. They love to prove others wrong to enhance their own standing. And if any scientist could prove Creation/God, it would've been done a long time ago.\n\nGo to a museum, take a class in biology, go to reputable sites on the Internet (like AAAS: http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution or http://www.talkorigins.org ) and find out for yourself."

That is the point of general relativity (light bends in a gravitational field). It's a long story... 4 years of college majoring in physics and 6 years writing a PhD in high energy physics will clear it all up for you."

What is the panda's adaptation for escaping preditors? and three other interesting facts? please give sources. If u want to send it to me in an email at sabrinaelkarmouty@yahoo.com","The giant panda is a national treasure in China and is therefore protected by law. This unique bear has long been revered by the Chinese and can be found in Chinese art dating back thousands of years. The Chinese call their beloved pandas ""large bear-cats."" People outside of China have been fascinated by giant pandas since they were first described by French Missionary Pere Armand David in 1869. Now, more than 100 years later, the worldwide love for pandas has been combined with international efforts to keep them from becoming extinct.\n\nFor years scientists have wondered whether pandas are bears, raccoons, or in a group all their own. Through studying the genetic code (DNA) in pandas’ cells, scientists have confirmed the panda's relationship with bears. Giant pandas are similar to other bears in their general looks, the way they walk and climb, and their skull characteristics. It's important to know that pandas are bears, because the more we know about pandas, the better we can help them reproduce and survive.\n\nGiant pandas are only about the size of a stick of butter at birth, and they're hairless and helpless. The panda mother gives great care to her tiny cub, usually cradling it in one paw and holding it close to her chest. For several days after birth, the mother does not leave the den, not even to eat or drink!\n\nYet despite the attention they receive from their mothers, many young pandas do not survive. Through captive propagation programs in China and other zoos around the world, we are learning more about the care of panda cubs and how to help them reach adulthood. \n\nBamboo is the most important plant in a giant panda's life. Pandas live in cold and rainy bamboo forests high in the mountains of western China. They spend at least 12 hours each day eating bamboo. Because bamboo is so low in nutrients, pandas eat as much as 84 pounds (38 kilograms) of it each day. Pandas grasp bamboo stalks with their five fingers and a special wristbone, then use their teeth to peel off the tough outer layers to reveal the soft inner tissue. Strong jaw bones and cheek muscles help pandas crush and chew the thick stalks with their flattened back teeth. Bamboo leaves are also on the menu, as pandas strip them off the stalks, wad them up, and swallow them. Giant pandas have also been known to eat grasses, bulbs, fruits, some insects, and even rodents and carrion. At the San Diego Zoo, pandas are offered bamboo, carrots, yams, and special leaf eater biscuits made of grain and packed with all the vitamins and minerals pandas need.\n\nToday, only around 1,600 giant pandas survive on Earth. There are several reasons why pandas are endangered:\n\nLow reproductive rate— Pandas like to be by themselves most of the year, and they have a very short breeding season when a male will look for a female to mate with. Females give birth to one or two cubs, which are very dependent on their mothers during the first few years of life. In the wild, mother pandas will care for only one of the young. In panda facilities in China, keepers help to hand raise any twin cubs. One baby is left with the mother and the keepers switch the twins every few days so each one gets care and milk directly from the mother.\n\nBamboo shortages— When bamboo plants reach maturity, they flower and produce seeds, and then the mature plant dies. The seeds grow slowly into plants large enough for pandas to eat. Giant pandas can eat 25 different types of bamboo, but they usually eat only the 4 or 5 kinds that grow in their home range. The unusual thing about bamboo is that all of the plants of one species growing in an area will bloom and die at the same time. When those plants die, pandas move to another area. But now, with humans taking up much of the panda’s habitat, pandas are often unable to move to another area and may face starvation.\n\nHabitat destruction— China has more than one billion people. As people build more cities and farms "

Personally, it grieves me to see people embrace irrationality like this, but unless someone actually wants to work in biology, how much harm does a belief in creationism do in practical terms?","I agree with mainwoolly (and not for the first time); I suspect that nonsensical beliefs of all kinds actually have a real-world, real-time effect, on the human mind if nothing else.\n\nWe all know people who never make a decision without first performing a tarot card reading, or faithfully check their horoscopes every day, or whatever.  They simply do not hear you when you point out that it's a pile, no, a truckload, nay, a Matterhorn of horse-hockey.  These same people retain enough sense to enable them to pass their drivers' license tests; to get and hold jobs; to raise children who stay out of prison (the majority of them, at any rate).  \n\nAnd they never notice the contradiction, they never notice that their own brains are divided against them.  It's like walking around with a big ole ugly-a$$ nine-hundred-pound gorilla perched on your shoulder.  I've never studied psychology so I can't understand how or why this works for anyone; but apparently it does.\n\nHow much might more have been accomplished already if so many of us weren't permitting ourselves to be held back in this way?  It doesn't bear thinking about, really."

"1","why are muslims so angry when islam is critisized? is allah and mo above criticism?","","Islam and Muslims are not particular to this kind of reaction and behavior.\nThere are intolerant Jews, Christians, Hindus, in fact in every religion you would find some intolerant people when their religion is attacked by inconsiderate and vile people.\nSome Muslims are easily offended when Western Christians use crude words like Muzzy, attack Allah out of Ignorance,thinking that Allah is a person and especially when such uneducated persons attack the sacred personage  of Prophet Muhammad ( Peace be upon him) and his wife Aisha ( Peace be upon her).\nWhat would amaze you also is that Muslims are equally incensed if Jesus, Moses, Abraham and the Prophets of God ( peace be upon them all) are wantonly attacked by vile and wicked people.\nIt is but natural to defend their belief.\nMuslims do not find pleasure in attacking the God (s) and Prophets (peace be upon them) and religions of other people and civilization.\nThis is what make Muslims so distinct and more civilized than other people\nPeace be upon him who accept true Guidance."

As you said, let's try to say the truth for a while, why is it totally wrong when Muslims in palastine try to take THEIR LAND by force which was invaded by Israel, is wrong? Why should Muslims feel happy in Iraqe that US invaded their country and if tried to free it from the invadors they are called terrorists????\nDo you honestly fall for the democracy thing ???!!!!!!

"1","Why do churches have their windows up high and covered in stain glass?  Is it so no one can see in or out?","There have been some recent questions about why many JW Kingdom Halls don't have windows.  That got me to thinking, so tonight, as I drove 250 miles around Kansas City, I checked out every church I passed.  I noticed that all of them had windows, but they were up high and covered in stain glass.  Many respondents to the previous questions about Kingdom Halls said that it was because JWs didn't want anyone seeing what went on inside, well the same can be claimed for any church.  In fact, a lot of churches do have things to hide, as has become evident by the number of claims made of child sexual abuse.  I wonder how many churches are as open to inspection as a Kingdom Hall, such as places where children can be taken advantage of?  In Kingdom Halls, the children are not segregated from the parents to where they can be harmed.  Is this what other churches are hiding?","Stained glass is also called ""artwork""; it falls in the same category as sculptures and paintings and frescoes, etc. It is not intended to hide anything, just there to be pretty and inspire those who look at it.\n\nSin, like molesting children, is not hidden by glass, stained or otherwise. Neither is it hidden by walls of concrete, wood, plaster, or steel. It is hidden by people of corrupt mind and heart, buried behind a life of false pretences and lies and slick showmanship. \n\nWe have had child molesting ""preachers"" in my town also.

Microorganisms grow in pretty much every condition on Earth, including hot and sulfurous ocean water by volcanic vents, in ice at the poles, in badly-preserved jars (botulism--anaerobic), inside the body, in ponds, in caves, in the dark, in the sunlight...it all depends on the specific type of microorganism.\n\nFor instance, sugar tends to kill bacteria, but mold loves sugar.  So a jar of jelly left in a fridge for a long time (cold, wet, sugary environment for the microorganisms) might not have bacteria, but it could have fuzzy mold on it.  It all depends.  \n\nBut from a food safety standpoint, you want food kept either below 40 degrees fahrenheit, or above 140 degrees, and keep it wrapped up and covered to avoid stuff dropping in it.  In general, microorganisms like: warm (not hot or cold), dark, moist, and somewhat neutral pH.  That'll grow mold, mildew, fungus, and many types of bacteria.  They usually don't like clean surfaces and they tend to die in chlorine bleach."

"2","Why does sucking helium change your voice?","weird phenomenon, can anyone give an actual scientific answer to it?","Helium is much lighter than air. Because of this, the speed of sound is much higher in helium. When you inhale helium you increase the speed of the sound of your voice. The shape of your vocal tract doesn't change. If you increase the speed of a sound you also increase the wavelength. However, on the way to the ear the sound travels thru air again and the wavelength goes back to normal. It's not the change in frequency that gives you the squeaky voice but a change in pitch. The sound has the same frequencies but helium causes a shift in your timbre. This means the higher frequencies are getting a higher enhancement than normal so the pitch changes. The end result? You sound like a chipmunk. \n\nAlthough inhaling helium is fun it's not exactly healthy. Every time you inhale pure helium, you are not inhaling oxygen. Whatever you do, never inhale helium from a high pressure tank! Besides the serious risk of lung damage, you could end up with bubbles of helium in the arteries that lead to your brain. This can lead to stroke-like symptoms and, of course, death. Still laughing? Didn't think so."

"1","In the Kaballah, the statement ""God counts the tears of women"",how would you interpret this?","","This may be a long answer. \n\nThe Kabballah says that women are on a higher spiritual plane than men.  The reason is because they have a womb.  When God decided to create the universe, at first he couldn't.  HE filled everything.  So he had to essentially rip a hole in his own being and create a void in the middle of himself.  He then gave birth to the whole universe in the void he had torn in himself.\n\nThe womb of a woman is like this.  It is a void in the middle of her being that gives birth to new little realities.  A mother gets to watch her child grow up and grow old.  She sees the joys and pains of the child all the way until her own death.  When they cry, she cries.  When they hurt, she cries.  When they succeed, she cries.  So the reason that god counts the tears of women is because they are like his own tears.  HE counts them to see the love and care and concern she had for her offspring, just as he has cried for his so many times"

"1","Dreamcatchers..?","I know they catch dreams or they wouldn't have that name,I know the ones I have seen are extremely beautiful,but what is the history behind them and what is it that they do besides the obvious if anything?","The history of the dream catcher has nearly been lost in the turmoil of cultural mixing and destruction that followed on the heels of the European invasion.  Dreamcatcher history is known with some credibility due to the dedicated field work of Frances Densmore at the beginning of the last century.  She conducted a careful and extensive study of many Native American cultures including that of the Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa) living in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, Canada. A simple description can be found in her book, Chippewa Customs, published by the Minnesota Historical Society Press (St. Paul) in 1929 and reprinted in 1979.  She described articles looking like spider webs that were usually hung from the hoop of a child's cradle board.  She said that 'they catch and hold everything evil as a spider's web catches and holds everything that comes into contact with it'. These 'dream catchers' were wooden hoops with a 3 1/2 in. diameter, woven with a web made of nettle-stalk fiber that was dyed red with the red sap of the root of bloodroot or the inner bark of the wild plum tree.   A facsimile of this traditional dream catcher can be seen at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in central Minnesota.  The spider web dream catcher shown at the left is very similar to the original dream catcher that has been a tradition for a  very long time.  In our dream catcher weaving kits you can find the materials and instructions for weaving this classic gift for the newborn.\n\nThe common dream catcher weave seen today is the traditional weave used for other articles, most commonly the hoop for the hoop and stick game of many tribes. Woven with strong rawhide with a hole in the center, a child would roll the hoop along the ground and another would try to throw a wooden spear through the hole in the center.  Stories of the dream catcher legend that describe the dreams going through a center hole are of recent origin.  The original dream catcher had a very tiny hole in the center and the legend describes ALL dreams being caught in the weaving.\n\nFor many years, only Ojibwe people made dream catchers as each tribe made only its original crafts.  In the mid 70’s, dream catcher earrings became popular and many people of other tribes began to make dream catchers.  Not knowing how to weave the spider web or not wanting to take the extra time needed they chose the mid-point weaving style of the hoop and stick instead of the end-point weave of the ancient spider web.  Many people, not knowing the significance of the twig or not being able to find the beautiful red willow of the northern woodlands, began to use metal rings wound with leather or string.  The thread of tradition was lost.  Now in the time of the Seventh Fire, the traditions are being returned to the people.  \nEach tribe and clan, however, has its own oral tradition and memory.  Passing along that memory by storytelling has not been easy with the traditional culture challenged, the tribal languages fallen into disuse, and poverty, drugs, and conflicting values have created a climate of fear, anger, despair, and confusion.  Now there are many legends of the dreamcatcher from many different Native American cultures.  Sometimes Anishinabe tell the story of the Lakota dreamcatcher with the ""Shinob"" traditional spider web, and Lakota tell the ""Shinob"" story with their ""Lakota"" dreamcatcher.  Authenticity is difficult, if not impossible, given the intermarriage among many tribes, with non-Indians, and the loss of the continuity historically provided by traditional elders.  I have encountered a few traditional elders who wanted to learn how to weave the dreamcatcher but they could find no one in their community who would or could teach them how to weave the ancient designs of their culture.  They had come to me.  \n\nIn 1996 I taught Ojibwe people at the Rediscovery Center on t"

Acts 1.8 \n \n16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.\n \n17  And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;\n \n18  they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\n \n============================================================\n\nMatthew 10\n\n8  Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.\n \n============================================================\n\nMark 6\n\n13  And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them. \n\n============================================================\n\nSome demons only come out with much praying and fasting.. \n\n============================================================\n\nIn Jesus Most Precious Name..\nWith Love..In Christ.. \n \ndemons are not metaphorical..they are real..they come out screaming and cursing.."

"2","the horizontal speed of the pillow relative to the ground?","In the cabin of a jetliner that cruises at 600 km/h, a pillow drops from an overhead rack into your lap below Since the jetliner is moving so fast, why doesn't the pillow slam into the rear of the compartment when it drops? What is the horizontal speed of the pillow relative to the ground? Relative to you inside the jetliner?","Hi,\n\nGalileo was faced by similar queries and this is his response:\n\nShut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some large ship, and have with you there some flies, butterflies, and other small flying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some fish in it; hang up a bottle that empties drop by drop into a wide vessel beneath it. With the ship standing still, observe carefully how the little animals fly with equal speed to all sides of the cabin. The fish swim indifferently in all directions; the drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing something to your friend, you need throw it no more strongly in one direction than another, the distances being equal; jumping with your feet together, you pass equal spaces in every direction. When you have observed all these things carefully (though there is no doubt that when the ship is standing still everything must happen in this way), have the ship proceed with any speed you like, so long as the motion is uniform and not fluctuating this way and that. You will discover not the least change in all the effects named, nor could you tell from any of them whether the ship was moving or standing still. In jumping, you will pass on the floor the same spaces as before, nor will you make larger jumps toward the stern than toward the prow even though the ship is moving quite rapidly, despite the fact that during the time that you are in the air the floor under you will be going in a direction opposite to your jump. In throwing something to your companion, you will need no more force to get it to him whether he is in the direction of the bow or the stern, with yourself situated opposite. The droplets will fall as before into the vessel beneath without dropping toward the stern, although while the drops are in the air the ship runs many spans. The fish in their water will swim toward the front of their bowl with no more effort than toward the back, and will go with equal ease to bait placed anywhere around the edges of the bowl. Finally the butterflies and flies will continue their flights indifferently toward every side, nor will it ever happen that they are concentrated toward the stern, as if tired out from keeping up with the course of the ship, from which they will have been separated during long intervals by keeping themselves in the air. And if smoke is made by burning some incense, it will be seen going up in the form of a little cloud, remaining still and moving no more toward one side than the other. The cause of all these correspondences of effects is the fact that the ship's motion is common to all the things contained in it, and to the air also. That is why I said you should be below decks; for if this took place above in the open air, which would not follow the course of the ship, more or less noticeable differences would be seen in some of the effects noted.\n\nAlthough, this seems obvious to us now in its day it was quite startling. But it is the same for an Astronaut on a space walk. His craft appears stationary to him, although both he and it a traveling at great speed. So, we judge that something is moving only by its movement relative to us or some other object.\n\nThis, if you like, is Galilean relativity, we judge objects to be moving only if they are moving relative to our frame of reference."
"1","Do you think that Jesus is the REAL son of GOD? and what evidence do you have?","","Jesus in Islam\nIslam is a religion which requires belief in not only the Prophethood of Muhammad but all the prophets of God, including Jesus (Qur'an 2:137).\nThe Holy book of Islam, the Quran, relates in detail the story of Jesus, including his birth, mission as a Prophet to the Israelites, and his crucifixion. Muslims believe that this story is in harmony with the Bible too. Indeed, a whole chapter in the Qur'an is named after the mother of Jesus (Chapter 19 - Maryam).\n\nDivinity of Jesus\nIslam presents Jesus as a human who believed in the absolute Unity and Indivisibility of God (Qur'an 3:52). \n\nMuslims consider the doctrine of Divinity of Jesus and Trinity as later changes to the teachings of Jesus. The New Testament itself furnishes abundant evidence to show that Jesus was only a human being whom God chose for the reformation of His people, and repeatedly contradicts the Divinity of Jesus. Jesus always referred to himself as having been sent by God (John 17:3) and his followers, too, considered him a man approved by God (Qur'an 19:37; Acts 2:22, John 3:2). \n\nHe was undoubtedly called the son of God, but this title has only been employed metaphorically and in fact is used for all the chosen ones of God (Matt 5:9, Exodus 4:22). The literal connotation of 'son of God' as a Divine Being and hence the subsequent development of Trinity Dogma was the result of Hellenistic influences on Christianity as it spread in the Gentile world. The Semitic usage of 'son of God' was misunderstood and forgotten and disputes about the exact status of Jesus erupted, as recorded in the early Church history. \n\nJesus prayed to God like all other God-fearing individuals (Luke 5:16), and engaged in spiritual exercises such as fasting (Matt 4:2). Furthermore, Jesus lacked knowledge of the future (Mark 13:32), as only the Divine Being possesses perfect and complete knowledge."

(Psalm 72:1-7; Daniel 2:44;) True Christians therefore make the coming of the Kingdom a recurring theme in their prayers.\n\nThis is what you are asking for then you pray for God's Kingdom to come\n\nThe Kingdom is the instrument that God will use to solve the problems that make life so difficult today.

If I died a stillborn does it still count. Is being born a sin in it's self? I don't get it.","simple answer:\n\nbecause he loves you\n\nExtended answer:\n\nThe first issue revolves around the perfection in God's creation. Some Bible students believe the Genesis account teaches perfection only in Eden. Outside the bounds of paradise there was a fallen world with death and destruction. Sin had entered the universe through the fall of Satan and the earth was subject to his dominion. If the Devil had already sinned before Adam and Eve, then evil had already been brought into the universe. Adam's sin, therefore would affect only the earth, not the heavens. Some Bible commentators want to restrict Adam's sin to Eden - the small plot of ground on the earth that had not been tainted by sin. \n\nScripture says Christ’s death was part of God’s eternal purpose.\n\nThen I said, ‘Here I am - it is written about me in the scroll - I have come to do your will, O God.” First he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them” (although the law required them to be made). Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all (Hebrews 10:7-\n\nJesus Paid The Penalty For Sin\n\nThe death of Christ was the payment for sin—the ransom paid to God to satisfy His holy demands. The Bible pictures humans as sinners who had rebelled against God. Christ’s death on the cross paid the penalty for the sin of humankind. Jesus died in our place as our substitute, receiving the punishment that was due us.\n\nThe Bible says.\n\n[Jesus Christ] was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification (Romans 4:25).\n\nThe writer to the Hebrews declared.\n\nSo Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many (Hebrews 9:28).\n\nThe penalty that Jesus paid for sin was not only for the human race; it was also for everything in the universe that had been marred by sin.\n\nBecause the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God (Romans 8:21).\n\nThe demands of a holy God were satisfied by Jesus’ death on the cross."

As far as having 10 year working electrodes.. i have heard of this, but I wouldnt count on the quality of these elctrodes over a wide pH range. They should be tested and verified. They are most likely indicating near correct pH in a vary stable solution and not very responsive over a large range ( in other words they're currently zeroed into reading correctly and wont if the solution varies a lot). The failure rate after 2 months maybe the case with electrodes that have been on a shelf for long periods beore being commissioned for use or less likely but I have seen it - a bad ""batch"" of electrodes you received from stock.

"1","why is Odysseus heroic?","","Deathless gods, in the Homeric presentation, had great supernatural powers which they employed to shape world [human] events.  These self same supernatural affinities could and often would resort to astound the less endowed ""mortals"" thus holding the mankind in a state of bewildered subjugation.  The condition was nothing short of a psychological tyranny.  Odysseus, as a man, could effect events and meet challenges with nothing more than the innate mortal qualities of intellect, sagacity and virtue.  He demonstrated that 'man' by sheer force of will with the employment of virtue could also shape events thus having a dramatic impact upon the life's course.  In so doing Odysseus demonstrated that the gap between gods and man was not as wide an expanse as suspected.  Therefore man could be free.  To this end he becomes the icon of the heroic figure."

And this weird phenomena of the opposite movement is called ""Retrograde Motion"" Most scientists state that all the planets will go through the same once atleast and our planet Earth is one of them. Planet Earth will move in the opposite direction some day and the sun will rise from the west!\n\nNow please tell me weather or not you have heard of such thing ?","Every morning on Mars, the Sun rises in the East, and every evening, it sinks to the West.\nSomeone got cunfused with they're information. MARS ITSELF \nRISES AND SETS IN THE EARTH'S SKIES FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST.\nThe retrograde motion is what causes MARS to shift rise and set directions in OUR SKY.\n\nFor the Sun in the skies of Mars to rise and set  in opposite horizons would mean that Mars suddenly came to a stop and started spinning backwards on it's axis.\nMars could only change its direction of planetary rotation if a planet larger than itself crashed into it with an unimaginable amount of force.\nSo no, that information is incorrect and Mars still rotates the same way around our sun."

"2","Why id the CSA of a cone ( pi*r * l) ?","Shouldn't it be (2* p1*r* l) ?","Good that you care to ask. The answer to this should be evident to you by integration (hope you have been introduced to calculus? If not, you will be this year.). \n\nI assume that you don't have much of a background.\n \nOK, let the cone be such that its height is H, base radius R. \n\nWhat you need to do is consider an infinitesimally thin section of the cone (a diagram should be so helpful here, unfortunately not possible) at height h from the bottom and of height (along the axis) 'dh', such that the radius of the section is a uniform 'r'. \n\n(Note that you have a uniform radius r to the section because you have chosen a very thin section of the cone.)\n\nNow, the surface area of the section considered is \n2*pi*r*dh*cosec x. (x is the cone half-angle)\n\nThe cosec term comes from basic trigonommetry, when you realise that the section is tilted and not exactly parallel to the axis. \n\nThe surface area  of the entire cone, indeed the curved surface area, is a summation of all such infinitesimal sections, each of surface area 2*pi*r*dh* cosec x \n(where r is the radius of each section). \n\nThis above sum can be found by \nintegrating 2*pi*r*dh*cosec x (that is a word in the language of calculus for finding out the sum of many small parts) over the entire height of the cone. \n\nalso realise that r = h tan x. \n\nso an integration of 2*pi*htan x*cosecx*dh gives us,\n\nCSA = 2*pi*sec x* (H^2/2)  \n    = pi*R* H (sec x/tan x)\n    = pi*R* H cosec x\n    = pi*R*L\n\nHope this satisfies."

Here's how i did it:\n\nYou can find the # mol of NaOH used:\n\nMolarity = (# mol)/(volume solution)\n0.4 = (# mol)/(.075 L)\n\nSolving, you get 0.03 mol of NaOH.\n\nUsing the balanced equation:\n\n3 NaOH + H3PO4 ==> Na3PO4 + 3 H2O \n\nYou see that 3 mol NaOH = 1 mol H3PO4.  Thus, if we have 0.03 mol NaOH, that means we have 0.01 mol H3PO4.\n\nNow we can solve for the molarity:\n\nMolarity = (0.01 mol H3PO4)/(0.05 L) = 0.2 M"

The term is used in biology, and is a common trait of the animal kingdom.  \n\nFor instance, look at yourself.  You have one eye on either side of your nose, one ear on either side of your head, one arm on either side of your shoulders and one leg on either side of your hips.  If you took a picture of yourself and cut it down the middle, from top to bottom, the two pictures would be mirror images of one another.  This is bilateral symmetry, the same on both sides."

Any sexual activity which does not end in intercourse is immoral and forbidden, be it oral or anal sex, or masturbation.

As partial compensation for this rigidity, birds have more neck vertebrae than many animals to provide enough flexibility to feed, groom, etc. See ref. 1.)\nSnake: How does the snake's vertebra indicate that it evolved to support slithering? (Answer: Snakes have a large number of vertebrae, which are connected together by ball-and socket joints. These characteristics allow extreme flexibility. Together with specialized muscles, the vertebra enable the snake to move with speed and agility. See ref. 2.)"

And I believe Cannon is a section of the church as well.  Where did this word come from and what does it mean in a religious context?","'Canon,' in this context, comes from a word meaning 'measuring rod.' It refers to the books which are recognized as being the Word of God.\n\nFor Old Testament books, they were not accepted unless people knew that they were written by a prophet.  Most books of the Old Testament have a connection to the book before them; this is known as the colophon principle.  Many of the apocryphal books in Catholic bibles were never accepted by the Jews of the time, but were added centuries later.\n\nFor New Testament books, they were not accepted unless they were written by an apostle or by a close traveling companion of an apostle (ie, Mark and Luke).\n\nAs far as the Catholic church goes, they have their 'canon law,' which they define as ""the name attached to that body of rules or laws for the direction of all faithful in matters of faith and conduct.""  It is their laws which they have added to the Bible.\n\nAs far as a 'section of the church,' I assume you mean a church building; in classical architecture, the chancel is the area where the people sit."
"2","when usung 'feet' for measurement, was that word originally introduced to relate walking steps?","","I think it is originally a British unit of length, equal to the length of a foot, created by tradesmen so they could record and plan lengths.\n\nThe ""Official"" foot was the lenght of the foot of the king - which is awkward, since it will change as kings change.\n\nEdit: hmm.. I got most of it right... here is the text from Wikipedia:\nThe foot as a measure was used in almost all cultures. The first known standard foot measure was from Sumeria, where a definition is given in a statue of Gudea of Lagash from around 2575 BC. The imperial foot was adapted from an Egyptian measure by the Greeks, with a subsequent larger foot being adopted by the Romans.\n\nThe popular belief is that original standard was the length of a man's foot. The original measurement was from King Henry I, who had a foot 12 inches long; he wished to standardise the unit of measurement in England. The average foot length is about 9.4 inches (240 mm) for current Europeans. Approximately 996 out of 1000 British men have a foot that is less than 12 inches long. A plausible explanation for the missing inches is that the measure did not refer to a naked foot, but to the length of footwear. This is consistent with the measure being convenient for practical purposes such as on building sites etc. People almost always pace out lengths whilst wearing shoes or boots, rather than removing them and pacing barefoot."

"1","mention some names of indian women freedom fighters?","","Woman's participation in India's freedom struggle began as early as 1817 when Bhima Bai Holkar fought bravely against the British colonel Malcolm and defeated him in guerilla warfare. In 1824 Rani Channama of Kittur resisted ate armed might of the East Indian Company. \n\n1 Rani of Jhansi \nRani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi whose heroism and superb leadership laid an outstanding example for all future generations of women freedom fighters. Married to Gangadhar Rao head of the state of Jhansi. She was not allowed to adopt a successor after his death by the British, and Jhansi was annexed. \nWith the outbreak of the Revolt she became determined to fight back. She used to go into the battlefield dressed as a man. Holding the reins of there horse in her mouth she used the sword with both hands. Under her leadership the Rani's troops showed undaunted courage and returned shot for shot. Considered by the British as the best and bravest military leader of rebels this sparkling epitome of courage died a hero's death in the battlefield. \nThe first name that comes to mind is that of the famous Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi. Dressed in men’s clothes, she led her soldiers to war against the British. Even her enemies admired her courage and daring. She fought valiantly and although beaten she refused to surrender and fell as a warrior should, fighting the enemy to the last. Her remarkable courage inspired many men and women in India to rise against the alien rule. \n\n2.  SAROJINI NAIDU \nThe other remarkable woman elected to the presidentship Indian National Congress was Sarojini Naidu. She became its president.dramatic meeting with another respected leader of time, Gokhle, in 1906 was to change her life forever. His response to her fiery speech brought into her life the impact of a visionary who saw in her oratory and brilliance a leader of the future. \n\nThe period from 1917 to 1919 was the most dynamic phase of Sarojini's career. During this time, she campaigned for the Montagu Chelmsford Reforms, the Khilafat issue, the draconian Rowlett Act and the Satyagraha. When Gandhi launched the Civil Disobedience Movement ,she proved a faithful lieutenant. With great courage she quelled the rioters, sold proscribed literature, addressed frenzied meetings on the carnage at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar.In 1930 when Mahatma Gandhi chose her to lead the Salt Satyagraha the stories of her courage became legion. After Gandhi's arrest she had prepared 2,000 volunteers under the scorching sun to raid the Dahrsana Salt Works, while the police faced them half a mile up the road with rifle, lathis (canes) are steel tipped clubs. The volunteers wildly cheered when she shook off the arm of the British police officer who came to arrest her and marched proudly to the barbed wire stockade where she was interned before being imprisoned. Freedom struggle was in full force and she came under the influence of Gopalakrishna Gokhale  and Gandhi. Gokhale advised her to spare all her energy and talents for nation's cause. She gave up writing poetry and fully devoted herself to emancipation of women, education, Hindu-Muslim unity etc. She became a follower of Gandhiji and accompanied him to England. Whenever in England, she openly criticized British rule in India which caught the attention of scholars and intellectuals. \n  \n3.KASTURBA GANDHI \nKasturba Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi's wife joined her husband while he was in South Africa and worked with him for many years there. She was a leader of Women's Satyagraha for which she was imprisoned. She helped her husband in the cause of Indigo workers in Champaran, Bihar and the No Tax Campaign in Kaira, Gujarat. She was arrested twice for picketing liquor and foreign cloth shops, and in 1939 for participating in the Rajkot Satyagraha. \n  \n4.ARUN ASAF ALI \nArun Asaf Ali, a radical nationalist played an outstanding role in the historic Quit India Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi on August 9, 194"

"1","Do you agree with the arguements the book ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" presents?","","Not really, it seems a desperate move to start moving letters around to fit a predetermined theory. The original grail (gradale) was a dish or plate - however, with the absence of such an artifact at some time in the past it became associated with a wine goblet (probably communion related) - then with the further absence of a suitably impressive cup it becomes the geneological blood line. In my opinion it is a dish or plate. The big question is ""why must it be kept hidden?"" The answer is that if discovered the images that are engraved into its surface will destroy the basis of the Christian religion. Consider this: Jesus existed, a clever and honest man, but his occupation was not a carpenter but a ""storyteller."" In his possession was the tool of his trade - a plate engraved with the prehistoric zodiac that preceded the present zodiac, a very ancient planisphere that had been passed down through the family for thousands of years. The images on this plate were used to form ""stories"" or even ""parables"" for others to listen to. The angels, the nativity, John the Baptist and even the crucifixion were stories that could be made up and read from the images on this plate. If this were true it would explain why the grail has never been found - it would destroy Christianity."
"2","How does orgasm give pleasure for both men and women? what is the science behind it?","","General\nBoth males and females can experience orgasms, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation.\n\nShared physiology\nOrgasm is the conclusion of the plateau phase of the sexual response cycle, shared by males and females alike. During orgasm, both males and females experience quick cycles of muscle contraction in the lower pelvic muscles, which surround both the anus and the primary sexual organs.\n\nOrgasms in both men and women are often associated with other involuntary actions, including vocalizations and muscular spasms in other areas of the body. Also, a generally euphoric sensation is associated with orgasm.\n\nAfterwards, orgasm generally causes perceived tiredness, and both males and females often feel a need to rest. This is recently attributed to the release of prolactin[1]. Prolactin is a typical neuroendocrine response in depressed mood and irritation[2].\n\nA recent study at the University of Groningen has indicated significant differences in brain activity during the female and male orgasm. PET scans showed that both the female and male orgasm 'shut down' areas in the brain associated with anxiety and fear (the Amygdala). It was found that the male orgasm focused the brain on sensory input from the genitals more than a female orgasm.\n\n\nHuman male orgasm\nIn a human male orgasm, there are rapid, rhythmic contractions of the prostate, urethra and the muscles at the base of the penis, which (in the adult) typically forces stored semen to be expelled through the penis' urethral opening, in a process known as peristalsis. This is referred to as ejaculation. The process usually takes from 3 to 10 seconds. The process is usually, but not always, extremely pleasurable. Orgasm is generally induced by direct stimulation of the penis. Some men experience heightened orgasm by direct stimulation of the prostate through the perineum.\n\nAs a man ages, it is normal for the amount of ejaculate to diminish, and hence, the length of time the man sustains orgasm also diminishes somewhat. This does not affect the pleasurable feeling of orgasm at all, it merely shortens the duration of it.\n\nFollowing ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs during which a man cannot have another orgasm. This period can be anywhere from less than a minute to over half a day, depending on age and other individual factors. A few cases have been reported of men who appear to have no refractory period at all. Scientists theorize that a pituitary gland difference may cause this unique ability.\n\nMale prostate orgasm\nSome men are able to achieve ejaculation or orgasm through intra-anal stimulation of the prostate gland. Men reporting the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to women's accounts of g-spot stimulation. Other men report finding anal stimulation or penetration of any kind to be painful, or simply that they find no profound pleasure from it. With sufficient stimulation, the prostate can also be ""milked"". Providing that there is no simultaneous stimulation of the penis, prostate milking can cause ejaculation without orgasm. When combined with penile stimulation, some men report that prostate stimulation increases the volume of their ejaculation, and provides an enhanced and more pleasurable version of the standard male orgasm.\n\n\nMale multiple orgasms\nIt is possible to have an orgasm without ejaculation (dry orgasm) or to ejaculate without reaching orgasm. Some men report that the ability to consciously separate orgasm and ejaculation has allowed them to achieve multiple orgasms. Men who have practiced this technique extensively report that they can sometimes experience a continuous ""wave"" of orgasm. This can last, in theory, indefinitely, but in practice is limited by the man's "

This region is also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone.\n\nThis area includes all the areas of the Earth where the sun reaches a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year. (In the temperate zones, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun never reaches an altitude of 90° or directly overhead.) The word ""tropics"" comes from Greek tropos meaning ""turn"", because the apparent position of the Sun oscillates between the two tropics with a period that defines the average length of a year.\n\nTropical plants and animals are those species native to the tropics. Tropical is also sometimes used in a general sense for a tropical climate, a climate that is warm to hot and moist year-round, often with the sense of lush vegetation. However, there are places in the tropics that are anything but ""tropical"" in this sense, with even alpine tundra and snow-capped peaks, including Mauna Kea, Mt. Kilimanjaro, and the Andes as far south as the northernmost parts of Chile and Argentina. Places in the tropics which are drier with low humidity are such as the Sahara Desert and Central Africa and Northern Australian Outback.\n\nTropical ecosystems may consist of rainforests, dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, desert and other habitat types. There are often significant areas of biodiversity and species endemism present particularly in rainforests and dry deciduous forests. Some examples of important biodiversity and/or high endemism ecosystems are: Costa Rican rainforests, Madagascar dry deciduous forests, Waterberg Biosphere of South Africa and eastern Madagascar rainforests. Often the soils of tropical forests are low in nutrient content making them quite vulnerable to slash-and-burn techniques, which are sometimes an element of shifting cultivation agricultural systems-."

So where Satan get freewill from? Why is he evil?  God created him....   (sorry, I tried to ask this question earlier... but I couldn't include all the information needed in the question line and people were reading the details).","Angels were created 4 His pleasure. To worship Him and praise Him. They were here before we were.Satan it says in the Bible was the praise & worship leader of Gods heavenly choir. His angelic name was Lucifer.\n\n One day satan started to wonder why he wasn't considered an equal to our Creator. Then he started to question Gods authority over him and over the other angels and he began to rally them against God. One third of the angels he convinced to war against God. And the way satan became evil was a little sin called Pride. Through out all of this God never interfered.\n\n I think God was waiting for Lusifer to repent. God loves all his creations until He cant reach them anymore. He waited until satan & his followers came agaist Him ready to battle. Ofcourse God won and cast him down to the earth.\nAll of this occurred before man was created. \n\nI belive that the reason GoD gives us all free will,angels included, is because He is a good parent. I am a mother and I know that I have to let my children make mistakes so that they will, with my guidence, become the kind of adult that I can be proud of & welcome into my home forever. But when they choose not to be good, and I know that I cant reach them anymore, I will cast them out of my house. It will break my heart but I must do it to show the others in my house or the other ones that want to be a part of my house, that that sort of bahavior will not be tolerated. \n\nBecause a parent must love all thier creations, we let them have free will. Understand? Read the Bible and you will see many ways that He has loved us."

All they have to do is figure out why we can't see it and replicate the pigmentation.","I suppose we could find some sort of clear plexi-glass type of material that would be suitable for aircraft-grade structures, but making the entire plane clear would probably be impossible.

The stealth bomber, for example, flies so high that visual detection by ground based anti-aircraft emplacements is quite low.  So low, in fact, that I have heard that it has never been fired upon from the ground (don't quote me on that though).  So for modern military aircraft applications, I would say radar invisibility is far more important than visual invisibility.\n\nAs a side note, I had read about a clothing-like light scattering material in either Popular Science or the Spectum magazine (forget which).  Anyway, it somehow bends or scatters light in such a way as to partially reveal what is behind the covered object.  There was a picture of a guy wearing a piece of it, and I was pretty amazed.

This practice is not restricted to negative emotions; many people have been known to cry when extremely happy. In humans, emotional tears can be accompanied by reddening of the face and sobbing — cough-like, convulsive breathing, sometimes involving spasms of the whole upper body. Tears brought about by emotions have a different chemical make up than those for lubrication.""\n(Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears )\n\nBut I want to know more...","I'm not sure exactly what your question is, there's what happens chemically in the brain, there's what happens chemically in the lachrymal glands etc etc. What I can tell you is that the excretion of tears does not have a anti-toxic function as is generally believed. Emotional tears do not get rid of a relevant amount of toxins or hormones. \nAs far as I know, the biological function of crying has not yet been determined as such. Although it has been suggested that crying is more an effect of a certain emotional relaxation, sort of 'letting go' of tension after which the physical reaction of crying occurs."
"1","Who know about something knows as The Chmelitzk Massacre in Europe?","","The Chmielnitzki Massacre was a furious holocaust in which Cossack troops in Russia and Poland had murdered over 100,000 Jews (out of a world population of about 1,500,000) in the most brutal and painful ways imaginable.\n\nChmielnicki Massacre (1648-1649)\nThe Cossacks, meanwhile, wanted to free the Ukraine from Polish domination — and sought to rule the Ukraine. In 1648, the Cossacks, led by Bohdan Chmielicki, began a series of campaigns by instigating the uprising of the Cossacks against the Jews. Chmielicki told people that the Poles had sold them as slaves “into the hands of the accursed Jews.” Angered by this notion, the Cossacks massacred tens of thousands of Jews during 1648-1649, in a war that would later be considered among the worst of that time period. \n\nMany Polish Jews fled the country, but most were brutally murdered. The massacre was devastating — both in numbers and effect. According to Jewish chronicles, the death toll reached approximately 100,000, and nearly 300 Jewish communities were destroyed. Cossack cruelty was so great that many Jews preferred to flee to captivity under Crimean Tartars, to be sold as slaves. The Deluge, as the catastrophe came to be known, brought devastation to both the Jews and the general population during the years of insurrection, invasions and wars. Famine and epidemics swept through parts of the country.\n\nThe following excerpts describe eyewitness accounts of the atrocities that took place in the regions of Mogila, Zaslav, and Nemirov, between 1648 until 1651.\n\nIn the city of Mogila they slaughtered 800 nobles together with their wives and children as well as 700 Jews, also with wives and children. Some were cut into pieces, others were ordered to dig graves into which Jewish women and children were thrown and buried alive. Jews were given rifles and ordered to kill each other...They surround young women and, as they struggled to escape, cut their clothes from their bodies. Then they performed abominations on them until they died screaming....\n\nThey arrived... (disguised) as if they had come with the Poles... in order that he open the gates of the fortress... and they succeeded... and they massacred about 6,000 souls in the town... and they drowned several hundreds in the water and by all kinds of cruel torments. In the synagogue, before the Holy Ark, they slaughtered with butchers' knives... after which they destroyed the synagogue and took out all the Torah books... they tore them up... and they laid them out... for men and animals to trample on... they also made sandals of them... and several other garments"".\n\nSome were skinned alive and their flesh was thrown to the dogs; some had their hands and limbs chapped off and their bodies thrown on the highway to be trampled by wagons and crushed by horses; some had wounds inflicted upon them and were then thrown on the street to die a slow death. They tore open women and then whipped them forcing them to crawl to their deaths.... others were buried alive. The enemy slaughtered infants in their mothers' laps. They were sliced into pieces like fish.... The infants were hung on the breasts of their mothers. Some children were pierced with spears.\n\nThe Ukraine did eventually become independent — but not for long. In 1651, Chmielnicki suffered defeat and was forced to accept a treaty that did not give him as much control over the Ukraine as he had hoped. In 1654, Chmielnicki persuaded the Cossacks to transfer their allegiance to the Russian czars. Anti-Semitism worsened after the Ukraine was annexed by Russia in 1653, as the Nationalist and Socialist Party of the Ukraine took control over the region. The pogroms of 1881 broke out and spread through the provinces of the Ukraine.\n\nBut even the Chmielnicki massacres didn’t halt Jewish migration to the Ukraine. Jews continued to play a prominent role in the economic recovery of the country during the 17th and 18th centuries. The sufferings endured by "

"2","what makes the sky blue?","","The sky appears blue to us on a clear day, because the atoms of nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere separate the suns white light into its many colours, and scatter them throughout the atmosphere.The wavelength of the blue light scatters better than the rest, predominates over the other colours in the light spectrum, and makes the sky appear blue to us.The scientific name for this phenomenon is the Tyndall effect, more commonly known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\nThis phenomenon describes the way in which light physically scatters when it passes through particles in the earths atmosphere that are 1/10th in diameter of the color of the light. The light spectrum ranges in wavelength from red to violet, and, since the wavelength of the blue light passes through the particles with greater ease than the wavelengths of the other colors of light, the sky appear blue to the naked eye.\n\nThe human eye has three types of light receptors, known as cones, located in the retina. The cones are either considered to be red, or blue, or green, based upon their strong response to light at these wavelengths. As light stimulates these receptors, our vision translates the signals into the colors we see.\n\nWhen gazing at the sky, the red cones respond to the small amounts of red light scattered, and even less strongly to the orange and yellow wavelengths. Although green cones respond to yellow, their response to scattered green and green-blue wavelengths is stronger. Finally, colors near the strongly scattered blue wavelengths stimulate the blue receptors.\n\nIn short, the skylight stimulates the red and green cones almost equally, while stimulating the blue cones more strongly. For these reasons, our vision naturally adjusts as clearly as possible to separate colors."

"2","How long would it take for satelite to reach mysterious dark energy?","","Dark Energy is a theoretical tool based on the need to explain observations of the Universe.\n\nCurrent cosmological theories are dominated by the 'Big Bang' theory. When this theory is proven wrong, then the need for Dark Energy will go away. It is theorized because the cosmologists need it to make their mathematical formulae to agree with previously accepted theories. It is like a carpenter who uses a ruler, believing it to accurately measure 1 foot. But he is not taking into account the expansion or contraction of the ruler depending on the ruler's temperature. In a small scale - the carpenter's project - such a tiny change is unimportant. But when the ruler becomes very very long, then such changes in length become unacceptable. At first, the carpenter will believe that some other factor was the reason that his measurements - taken on days with differing temperatures - produced differing lengths. But once the carpenter understand the relationship of his tool to temperature, he can take the temperature into account. \n\nCosmology is using many old tools as it tries to explain the Universe. But it is too soon to understand all the variables that are producing conflicting answers. Cosmologists make their best guess as to which tools are giving the best, most accurate, most usable answers, and then go on from there.\n\n;-D But every tool that has an unknown error or bias makes finding the truth impossible. That is why there are theories that are almost exact opposites of each other. Such theories can not both be correct. Probably they are both wrong."

"2","Is the longest day adjacent to the shortest night?","My dad has insisted for years that it isn't.   When I ask him to explain he says ""it's the obliquity of the elliptic"" and that's as far as I get.\n\nNote to the drongo 2-point collectors: yes I KNOW that day and night are not the same as each other!","I'm not sure what he means by his explanation, but he's not totally off to think there would at least be a possibility of the longest 'day' not being adjacent to the shortest 'night'.\n\nAs measured from the Sun's local zenith to the next local zenith, solar days are not the same length of time (24 hours is just the average amount of time to get from noon to noon).  It takes longer to get from local noon to the next local noon at the solstices when the Earth is tilted directly toward or directly away from the Sun.  The shortest solar days (noon to noon) should be at the equinoxes.  (In other words, if there are more total seconds in the solar day at the solstice, then having the most daylight seconds doesn't necessarily mean having the shortest night time seconds).\n\nAdditionally, the Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical.  At perihelion (closest point to the Sun), the Earth is traveling faster and sweeping out a bigger angle per second.  That means the Earth has to rotate further to get back to noon the next day.  Solar days near perihelion are longer while solar days near apohelion (furthest from Sun) are shorter.  This is where your dad's argument starts to break down.  The Earth is at apohelion around the first week of July and at perihelion the first week of January.  In other words, there are more seconds in a solar day in the winter than there are in the summer.  The tilt of the Earth is more significant, so there are still more seconds in a solar day near the summer solstice than either equinox, even if the longest solar day (noon to noon) isn't in the summer.\n\nThe biggest reason his argument breaks down is sheer magnitude.  The variation in the length of a solar day is in seconds/day while the difference in the amount of daylight/darkness can be minutes/day (the amount of variation depends on a person's latitude)\n\nFor 2006, the longest daytime period will be on Jun 21, with the shortest nightime period being Jun 20 or 21 (the Naval Observatory's charts only list hours and minutes)."

Other more complicated quantum fields are used to describe electrons inside a superconductor.\n\nAs for Tesla he was an excellent inventor who was unlucky in business and due to the machinations of rivals. He was correct in understanding the AC was superior to DC for transmitting electrical current (contrary to Edison), and did a lot of early work in Radio - probably before Marconi. \n\nUnfortunately today various crank scientific theories and crackpot ""free energy"" inventions toss his name around, using his reputation as being ""right but unrewarded"" to someone make their own theories seem right. (In other words, ""people didn't listen to Tesla, so when they say I am a crank they are just a wrong"" - common crank logic.)\n\nSo, I don't think there is anything here to investigate, I'm afraid. Tesla didn't pull energy from a ""quantum field."""
"1","Why is it important to be respectful and obedient?","","2 separate topics here:\n\n1) Respectful - The more respect you show, the more respect you will be shown.  You earn respect...it is not just handed out to people.  That 80 year old war vet earned our respect, and he should be treated as such.  Always treat people with respect, unless you know exactly why they should not.\n\n2) Obedient - This depends on the question, ""to whom.""  To father and mother, yes.  They are responsible for you, and they are your parents.  You should listen to them and do as they say.  To teachers, yes.  Same as above.  To God, yes, same as above.\nTo any others, use your best sense of judgment.  Treat them with respect, but use judgment before blindly being obedient.  After all, you are a human...not a dog."

They were rather fierce tempered creatures, and prefered habitat which included both forested and open areas (rather similar to what white-tailed deer prefer), rather than bald prairie habitat.  They were larger than modern cattle, up to 6 feet at the shoulder, and with nasty upcurving horns that could easily gore a person.\n\nThey are well represented in cave art going back tens of thousands of years, and were also important in the religions of many early Near-Eastern settlements, such as Catal Huyuk.  Aurochs are also used in heraldry, and remain on the coat of arms of several nations.\n\nAurochs went extinct in Europe (Poland) in the seventeenth century, mostly due to habitat loss.  They were incapatable with the more intensive agriculture that was being practised across Europe.  By the time some conservation measures were implemented (even nobles weren't allowed to hunt them by the end, and gamekeepers were encouraged to clear land for them to graze) it was already too late."

It was also theorized that Neibuhr credited a 18th CE theologican Fredrich Oetinger for writing the Prayer.  ANother possible origin of the prayer might have come from a book ""Between Dawn & Dark"" (1957) by Fredrick Ward Kates that went like this:\n\nAlmighty God, our heavenly father, give us serenity to accept what cannot be changed, courage to change what should be changed, and wisdom to know the one from the other.\n\nThe LONG version that Neibuhr wrote went like this.

"1","Is dying on a cross the worst way possible to die, or are there worse ways?","I have heard people suggest that what Jesus went through was the worst pain that anyone could go through.  Should this assertion be analyzed?  If it´s true that many people volunteer to be crucified every year, then can it really be the worst torture possible?  Did Hypatia, who was skinned alive, die a worse death?  Did many people who were boiled alive, flayed with red-hot pincers, and burned slowly after being coated with oil, die a much worse death?  If Jesus died early on the cross, then did the other two themselves on the other crosses suffer even more?  Is it common to be whipped before being crucified, and if so, have many people been whipped 39 times in a similar fashion?  Did Paul himself say that he was whipped thusly on three separate occasions?  Was the whole process that Jesus went through a normal procedure in Roman times?  Were many other people whipped, forced to carry a cross, and crucified?","Well not that cruxifiction is a walk in the park but YES, there are more painful deaths, ironically some of them were contrived by the very same Church trying to ensure EVERYONE believed the doctrine of Christianity as they saw it during the Inquisition. \n\nSome of their death/torture methods\n\nFlaying- Skinning a person alive and rubbing salt into the raw flesh\n\nDisembowelment- You can imagine for yourself\n\nHung, Drawn and Quatertered- Like the name says\n\nBeing tossed unto spikes- If the landing was not a well aimed one, your death would not be mercifully short. \n\nAmazing how barbaric humans can be."

The tracks were found at the bottom of a three-foot thick layer of sandstone overlaying mudstone. The fossil evidence indicates that the Johnson farm was located along the margins of a shallow saline lake 200 million years ago. As the water receded, dinosaurs walking through the leftover clay left impressions of their feet including scales of their skin and prints of their toes. As the mud hardened, cracks around the tracks formed. Eventually the lake level rose and buried the tracks with sand and silt. Over time the sand hardened and became sandstone thus preserving the dinosaur tracks. Within the three-foot sandstone blocks are several track-forming layers."

That would be ridiculous cause why would one want to be put back on earth if they were in heaven?  Any intelligent commentary would be much appreciated.","First of all, you do not have and immortal soul, if you did, then why had no one gone to Heaven before Jesus came to the Earth, 4000 years had came & gone since Adam & Eve, millions of people had died, what did Jesus say to a man of the Pharisees, Nic·o·de'mus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.\n\nJohn 3:13\nMoreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.\n\nJesus Christ spoke about the condition of the dead. He did so with regard to Lazarus, a man whom he knew well and who had died. Jesus told his disciples: “Lazarus our friend has gone to rest.” The disciples thought that Jesus meant that Lazarus was resting in sleep, recovering from an illness. They were wrong. Jesus explained: “Lazarus has died.” (John 11:11-14) Notice that Jesus compared death to rest and sleep. Lazarus was neither in heaven nor in a burning hell. He was not meeting angels or ancestors. Lazarus was not being reborn as another human. He was at rest in death, as though in a deep sleep without dreams. Other scriptures also compare death to sleep. For example, when the disciple Stephen was stoned to death, the Bible says that he “fell asleep.” (Acts 7:60) Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote about some in his day who had “fallen asleep” in death.  1 Corinthians 15:6.\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that the dead “are conscious of nothing at all.” They are not alive and have no conscious existence anywhere. The account of Lazarus confirms this. Upon returning to life, did Lazarus thrill people with descriptions of heaven? Or did he terrify them with horrible tales about a burning hell? No. The Bible contains no such words from Lazarus. During the four days that he was dead, he had been “conscious of nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Lazarus had simply been sleeping in death.  John 11:11.\nThe account of Lazarus also teaches us that the resurrection is a reality, not a mere myth. Jesus raised Lazarus in front of a crowd of eyewitnesses. Even the religious leaders, who hated Jesus, did not deny this miracle. \n\nThink about this too: If Lazarus had been in heaven for those four days, would he not have said something about it?—  And if he had been in heaven, would Jesus have made him come back to earth from that wonderful place?   Of course not!\n\nYet, many people say that we have a soul, and they say that the soul lives on after the body dies. They say that Lazarus’ soul was alive somewhere. But the Bible does not say that. It says that God made the first man Adam “a living soul.” Gen. 2:7,  Adam was a soul. The Bible also says that when Adam sinned, he died. He became a “dead soul,” and he returned to the dust from which he had been made. The Bible also says that all Adam’s offspring inherited sin and death too.\n\nThe Scriptural teaching of the resurrection, however, is not compatible with the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. If an immortal soul survived death, no one would need to be resurrected, or brought back to life. Indeed, Martha expressed no thought about an immortal soul that was living on elsewhere after death. She did not believe that Lazarus had already gone to some spirit realm to continue his existence. On the contrary, she showed her faith in God’s purpose to reverse the effects of death. She said: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.” (John 11:23, 24) Likewise, Lazarus himself related no experiences of some afterlife. There was nothing to report.\n\nClearly, according to the Bible, the soul dies and the remedy for death is the resurrection. You enjoy the best sleep ever, until Jesus resurrects you, sometime in the future."

His face begins to shine as the sun, and his garments become brilliant as light.\n\nHow strengthening this vision proves to be, both to Jesus and to the disciples!

Tip does not hold the record for fastest sustained winds in a cyclone alone; Typhoon Keith in the Pacific, and Hurricane Camille and Hurricane Allen in the North Atlantic currently share this record as well [15], although recorded wind speeds that fast are suspect, since most monitoring equipment is likely to be destroyed by such conditions.\n\nCamille was the only storm to actually strike land while at that intensity, making it, with 190 mph (305 km/h) sustained winds and 210 mph (335 km/h) gusts, the strongest tropical cyclone of record to ever hit land. For comparison, these speeds are encountered at the center of a strong tornado, but Camille, like all tropical cyclones, was much larger and long-lived than any tornado.\n\nTyphoon Nancy in 1961 had recorded wind speeds of 213 mph (343 km/h), but recent research indicates that wind speeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high, and this is no longer considered the fastest storm on record. [16] Similarly, a gust caused by Typhoon Paka over Guam was recorded at 236 mph (380 km/h); however, this reading had to be discarded, since the anemometer was damaged by the storm. Had it been confirmed, this would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded at the Earth's surface. (The current record is held by a non-hurricane wind registering 231 mph (372 km/h) at Mount Washington in New Hampshire.) [17]\n\nTip was also the largest cyclone on record, with a circulation 1,350 miles (2,170 km) wide. The average tropical cyclone is only 300 miles (480 km) wide. The smallest storm on record, 1974's Cyclone Tracy, which devastated Darwin, Australia, was roughly 30 miles (50 km) wide. [18]\n\nHurricane Iniki in 1992 was the most powerful storm to strike Hawaii in recorded history, hitting Kauai as a Category 4 hurricane, killing six and causing $3 billion in damage.\n\n \nThe first recorded South Atlantic hurricaneOn March 26, 2004, Cyclone Catarina became the first recorded South Atlantic hurricane. Previous South Atlantic cyclones in 1991 and 2004 reached only tropical storm strength. Hurricanes may have formed there prior to 1960 but were not observed until weather satellites began monitoring the Earth's oceans in that year.\n\nA tropical cyclone need not be particularly strong to cause memorable damage; Tropical Storm Allison in June 2001 had its name retired for killing 41 people and causing over $5 billion damage in East Texas, even though it never became a hurricane; the damage from Allison was mostly due to flooding, not winds or storm surge. Hurricane Jeanne in 2004 was only a tropical storm when it made a glancing blow on Haiti, but the flooding and mudslides it caused killed over 3,000 people.\n\nOn August 29 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana and Mississippi. The U.S. National Hurricane Center, in its August review of the tropical storm season stated that Katrina is probably the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. Its death toll is above 1300, mainly from flooding and the aftermath. It is also es"

"1","is behaviour based on the circumstances in which you are raised or do inherent tendencies hold a stronger sway","why do people who are raised by loving, moral families sometimes commit acts that are amoral?","Ahhh...nature versus nurture!  Even the experts cannot say with certainty whether nature and your genetic makeup or your nurturing is what makes up the person. There have been studies done with twins who were raised apart, and found that the twins had MANY things that they did just alike, from little things such as which hand they used to open a letter to bigger things such as they body-type and coloring of the people they fell in love with!  There have also been many studies done as to how poverty, violence, drug/alcohol abuse, sexual/physical abuse and parental abandonment affects children, especially in the birth to age 4 range, and how this shows up in their later life as violence in men and self-abuse in women. So having said all this, I personally feel that it is a combination of both, and sometimes it is neither. There are always the stories of the family who did everything right and still wound up with a drug addicted child or a murderer or rapist on their hands. But if you take a 'normal' family and have them raise a child (by normal I mean average, honest, working, functioning people)you will by and large see differences in that child as compared to a child raised by a disfunctional, abusive, out of control, self-serving family.

The difference in t2g and eg levels (∆o) determines whether a complex is low or high spin.

But here's the thing you have to consider ...\n\nA few months ago, I was figuring out a similar route, but using Anchorage and Vancouver instead.  To and from Alaska, you have to take the Alaska Highway through Watson Lake, B.C. (or maybe that's in the Yukon).\n\nAnyway, there are two choices at Watson Lake.  One is the Alaska Highway toward Edmonton, then down through Prince George, B.C., and over to Smithers on Hwy. 16, I think.\n\nThe alternative is to go down the Stewart-Cassier Highway (Hwy. 37) in western B.C.  This road is they most direct route between Smithers and Watson Lake ... going through Prince George is a lot longer.\n\nThe problem is that mapquest doesn't want to route you along Hwy. 37.  You have to force it by routing yourself through a town along that road.  (Then it works.)  Mapquest tries very hard to keep you off Hwy. 37, saying that portions are unpaved, that you'll average 16 mph, etc., etc.\n\nDon't believe it.  Unless you're going at a bad time of year, that route is okay, and it's very scenic.  Make sure you gas up everywhere you can, and you'll be alright."

"2","what is the amt of vaginal fluid discharged by females during intercourse.is too much wetting considered sick?","","Too much natural lubrication (wetness) during sex reduces pleasure for both partners. Females lose greater stimulation along the vaginal walls. Men lose out on the corresponding ‘tight’ sensation that they love. We all have an optimum level of friction that is required to enable heightened pleasure for both partners, thus leading to easier climax. This level of stimulation can most easily be obtained by experimenting with your wetness level. Sex could be much more satisfying than what you think it already is. \nA woman’s wetness level increases naturally as arousal increases. But for some ladies, even the slightest turn-on is enough to produce an extravagant amount of lubrication. If excess wetness is a problem for you, OR if you wish to simply experiment with different levels of wetness, seeking the most pleasurable ‘tight’ sensation for your man, what can you do?\n\nFirst, realize that there is more involved in sex than just the intercourse part of it. More women achieve orgasms by clitoral stimulation than by intercourse. However, intercourse is an intimate act & should be satisfying when possible. If it is not enjoyable, then a couple will more than likely become romantically distant. \nSecondly, you should see your doctor to be sure there is no infection, abnormalities, or other problem causing your excess wetness, especially if it is something new. \n\nI can understand what they're saying (above), but there are lots of different things to try and experiment with positions etc- it can't be as bad as too dry, which would be painful and awkward..."

I think that the church hides lots of things and the bible is just a book written with the things they want us to know. I think that some of the books that have not been included in the bible are taken out for reasons that would make us think twice about the entire world and the entire religion thing. The same way that it would make us change the way we see Jesus."

"2","why combustion of alkenes require lesser amount of O2 but burns with sootier flame?","Will the flame less sooty if we use more O2?? I do not think so but I would like to confirm.","To understand this question, you need to know what kind of product will be produced during a combustion. Generally, for a complete combustion of a hydrocarbon (contains only H and C), the product will be H2O and CO2. Depending on the C and H content in the hydrocarbon, you will produce different amount of H2O and CO2. \n\nOn the other hand, if it is an incomplete combustion (with limited supply of O2), apart from CO2 and H2O, you may also produce C and CO. The relative amount between them varies depending on the amount of O2 that is made available. With very limited amount of O2, more C (soot) will be produced. This leads to the ""sooty"" flame you are seeing.\n\nIn order to explain why generally alkenes require less O2 to burn compared to alkanes, let's compare ethane (2 C alkane) and ethene (2 C alkene). \n\nEthane has a formula C2H6 while ethene has a formula C2H4. Their corresponding balanced equation for combustion are:\n\nC2H6 + 7/2 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O\nC2H4 + 3 O2 → 2CO2 + 2 H2O\n\nAs you see, since both compounds have same number of C, they both produce 2 mole of CO2 for every mole of compound. However, since they have different number of H, the number of moles of H2O produced will be different. Since H2O has a fixed formula, in order to produce it, you need to supply O2. That's why the two compounds require different amount of O2.\n\nThe reason that you see a sooty flame is due to the fact that you don't have enough oxygen supply during the burning process. You can easily confirm this by using just a Bunsen burner (but be very carefully!!!). First, turn on your Bunsen burner with the air hole closed. The flame you see at the moment should be a luminous flame. It is golden yellow color. Now, if you carefully put a glass plate (hold with clamp or other device) on top of the flame and slowly move towards the tip of the burner (but don't cover it completely), you should see the plate will get ""darker"" by the flame. This is the soot produced during the combustion. Now, take away the plate, open the air hole in the burner to the max. You should see a the flame turns to blue. If you put the glass plate (with the soot marks) back to the flame, you can see the flame can slowly ""clean up"" the plate (if enough O2 is supplied with the flame) and the soot will disappear. The soot is turn back to CO2 due to the excess of O2."

Additionally, a friend of mine assures me that the people at her work always act a bit strange on the full moon.  However, I doubt it has anything specifically to do with water.  Everything on Earth experiences the gravity shift - it's just that water in the ocean is more free to react, being a liquid.

"1","Are Scottish people descendents of the Irish?","I mean, did their ancestors come from Ireland. I haven't gotten a good answer yet.","Igstrike is basically right, but that's not the whole story.

Any scientist working on submergence toleranc trait can aptl answer this question.","Submergence tolerance is an important characterisitc to breed into improved rice cultivars for rainfed lowland and deepwater areas. It may also be useful as a strategy for weed management in areas where rice is seeded directly into standing water, and deeper water levels (20cm) can be used for weed suppression. Genetic studies have been conducted (Mohanty et al. 1982; Haque et al. 1989), but the specific genes controlling tolerance have not been identified. \n    We studied the inheritance of submergence tolerance in a cross between the highly tolerant indica line IR40931-26-3-3-5 and the susceptible japonica line P1543851. IR40931-26 has a similar level of tolerance to FR13A, from which it derived the trait (Mackill et al. 1993). At 8 DAS, F3 families were subjected to 14-16 d submergence in greenhouse tanks. Individual plants were scored on a scale of 1 (tolerance) to 9 (susceptible) 1 wk after the water was removed. \n    Differences among F3 families were highly significant, and means ranged from 1.6 to 8.9, compared to 1.5 and 8.4 for the tolerant and susceptible families. DNA from the F2 plants giving rise to the nine most tolerant and most susceptible F2 families were bulked and assayed with 624 RAPD markers. Five RAPD bands associated with either the tolerant or susceptible families were asseyed on the entire F2 population. These five bands were linked to each other. RFLP markers from Cornell University, USA (McCouch et al. 1988), and from the Rice Genome Program, STAFF Institute, Tsukuba, Japan (Kurata et al. 1994) were used to map these RAPD markers to the end of chromosome 9 (Fig. 1). Analysis by Mapmaker/QTL (Lincoln et al. 1992) identified a locus near the RFLP"

"2","explain 5 layers of epidermis?","","The Epidermis\n\nThe epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and protects the body from the environment. The thickness of the epidermis varies in different types of skin; it is only .05 mm thick on the eyelids, and is 1.5 mm thick on the palms and the soles of the feet. The epidermis contains the melanocytes (the cells in which melanoma develops), the Langerhans' cells (involved in the immune system in the skin), Merkel cells and sensory nerves. The epidermis layer itself is made up of five sublayers that work together to continually rebuild the surface of the skin: \n\nThe Basal Cell Layer\nThe basal layer is the innermost layer of the epidermis, and contains small round cells called basal cells. The basal cells continually divide, and new cells constantly push older ones up toward the surface of the skin, where they are eventually shed. The basal cell layer is also known as the stratum germinativum due to the fact that it is constantly germinating (producing) new cells.\n\nThe basal cell layer contains cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes produce the skin coloring or pigment known as melanin, which gives skin its tan or brown color and helps protect the deeper layers of the skin from the harmful effects of the sun. Sun exposure causes melanocytes to increase production of melanin in order to protect the skin from damaging ultraviolet rays, producing a suntan. Patches of melanin in the skin cause birthmarks, freckles and age spots. Melanoma develops when melanocytes undergo malignant transformation.\n\nMerkel cells, which are tactile cells of neuroectodermal origin, are also located in the basal layer of the epidermis. \n\nThe Squamous Cell Layer \nThe squamous cell layer is located above the basal layer, and is also known as the stratum spinosum or “spiny layer” due to the fact that the cells are held together with spiny projections. Within this layer are the basal cells that have been pushed upward, however these maturing cells are now called squamous cells, or keratinocytes. Keratinocytes produce keratin, a tough, protective protein that makes up the majority of the structure of the skin, hair, and nails. \n\nThe squamous cell layer is the thickest layer of the epidermis, and is involved in the transfer of certain substances in and out of the body. The squamous cell layer also contains cells called Langerhans cells. These cells attach themselves to antigens that invade damaged skin and alert the immune system to their presence. \n\nThe Stratum Granulosum & the Stratum Lucidum \nThe keratinocytes from the squamous layer are then pushed up through two thin epidermal layers called the stratum granulosum and the stratum lucidum. As these cells move further towards the surface of the skin, they get bigger and flatter and adhere together, and then eventually become dehydrated and die. This process results in the cells fusing together into layers of tough, durable material, which continue to migrate up to the surface of the skin.\n\nThe Stratum Corneum\nThe stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis, and is made up of 10 to 30 thin layers of continually shedding, dead keratinocytes. The stratum corneum is also known as the “horny layer,” because its cells are toughened like an animal’s horn. As the outermost cells age and wear down, they are replaced by new layers of strong, long-wearing cells. The stratum corneum is sloughed off continually as new cells take its place, but this shedding process slows down with age. Complete cell turnover occurs every 28 to 30 days in young adults, while the same process takes 45 to 50 days in elderly adults.\n\nThe Dermis\nThe dermis is located beneath the epidermis and is the thickest of the three layers of the skin (1.5 to 4 mm thick), making up approximately 90 percent of the thickness of the skin. The main functions of the dermis are to regulate temperature and to supply the epidermis with nutrient-saturated blood. Much of the body’s water supply is stored"
"2","What is the difference between the sun and a planet?????????","","Twertyto's answer is the best! When I was just learning about astronomy I asked the same question. Someone told me a very simple answer that just might work for you:  A planet reflects light and a star creates it. That sounds simple enough for simpler times! But now welcome to the 21st century!!!\nBrown dwarfs are kind of the ""animal"" that bridges these two seemingly different objects. Astronomy is having a hard (but fun) time right now trying to decide exactly what a planet is- from the very large to the very small. Is an object 75 times the size of Jupiter a planet? 79 times? 81 times? No one seems to know. Do we call them planets or officially name them Brown Dwarfs. On the other side of the issue, is Pluto a planet? They just discovered a larger than Pluto object and several almost-the-size-of-Pluto objects out past Pluto's orbit. Are all of these planets? If Pluto's not a planet, but now has been discovered to have at least 3 moons (two new one's were just discovered recently), then what do we call it? \nThis has been a surprisingly tough answer for Astronomers as well, so not only is it a great question, but you- and everyone else- might have to stick around for a while for the difinitive answer!!!"

"1","What do YOU think about THIS??","Please take a moment to read the following TownHall.com column by Dennis Prager, who is a Jew. After reading the column, take the suggest action at the bottom of this email. After you have read it, please forward it to your friends and family. \n\nAmerica, Not Keith Ellison, decides what book a congressman takes his oath on \nBy Dennis Prager - Tuesday, November 28, 2006 \n\nKeith Ellison, D-Minn., the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, has announced that he will not take his oath of office on the Bible, but on the bible of Islam, the Koran. \n\nHe should not be allowed to do so -- not because of any American hostility to the Koran, but because the act undermines American civilization. \n\nFirst, it is an act of hubris that perfectly exemplifies multiculturalist activism -- my culture trumps America's culture. What Ellison and his Muslim and leftist supporters are saying is that it is of no consequence what America holds as its holiest book; all that matters is what any individual holds to be his holiest book. \n\nForgive me, but America should not give a hoot what Keith Ellison's favorite book is. Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don't serve in Congress. In your personal life, we will fight for your right to prefer any other book. We will even fight for your right to publish cartoons mocking our Bible. But, Mr. Ellison, America, not you, decides on what book its public servants take their oath. \n\nDevotees of multiculturalism and political correctness who do not see how damaging to the fabric of American civilization it is to allow Ellison to choose his own book need only imagine a racist elected to Congress. Would they allow him to choose Hitler's ""Mein Kampf,"" the Nazis' bible, for his oath? And if not, why not? On what grounds will those defending Ellison's right to choose his favorite book deny that same right to a racist who is elected to public office? \n\nOf course, Ellison's defenders argue that Ellison is merely being honest; since he believes in the Koran and not in the Bible, he should be allowed, even encouraged, to put his hand on the book he believes in. But for all of American history, Jews elected to public office have taken their oath on the Bible, even though they do not believe in the New Testament, and the many secular elected officials have not believed in the Old Testament either. Yet those secular officials did not demand to take their oaths of office on, say, the collected works of Voltaire or on a volume of New York Times editorials, writings far more significant to some liberal members of Congress than the Bible. Nor has one Mormon official demanded to put his hand on the Book of Mormon. And it is hard to imagine a scientologist being allowed to take his oath of office on a copy of ""Dianetics"" by L. Ron Hubbard. \n\nSo why are we allowing Keith Ellison to do what no other member of Congress has ever done -- choose his own most revered book for his oath? \n\nThe answer is obvious -- Ellison is a Muslim. And whoever decides these matters, not to mention virtually every editorial page in America, is not going to offend a Muslim. In fact, many of these people argue it will be a good thing because Muslims around the world will see what an open society America is and how much Americans honor Muslims and the Koran. \n\nThis argument appeals to all those who believe that one of the greatest goals of America is to be loved by the world, and especially by Muslims because then fewer Muslims will hate us (and therefore fewer will bomb us). \n\nBut these naive people do not appreciate that America will not change the attitude of a single American-hating Muslim by allowing Ellison to substitute the Koran for the Bible. In fact, the opposite is more likely: Ellison's doing so wi","I am not sure how to respond to this but I do get alerts from AFA also... I will check it out ..Thanks for the Info..."

"1","what was life like in England in the 1800s?","","It depends on what class you belonged to and where you lived. There was a rigid class system, though the middle class gained a new prominence. Britain didn't have a welfare system back then, so there were lots of poor people living in slums in major cities like London. The poor often had to go to workhouses, or if they were lucky, they were sometimes employed as household servants. Alcoholism was rampant in the slums.

"2","How does a castell interlock work in an metal clad VCB operated switchgear?","","Castell interlock is a mechanical interlock so that you won't have 2 supplies incoming to the same busbar. \n\nImagine you have 2 incoming to 2 MainSwitchBoard in which there is a coupling between the 2 MainSwitchBoards. \n\nIn case if 1 incoming down, you use the castell interlock to operate the coupling so that the 2 MainSwitchBoards share 1 incoming supply. \n\nIn the above simple scenario, you may be expecting using Castell Key type ""1"" install at the 1st incoming and Castell Key type ""1"" (same) install at the 2nd incoming. While there is another Castell key at the coupling that is without the key.\n\nIf Incoming No. 1 Fails, chargeman just take out the castell key Type ""1"" from the Incoming No.1 and operate at the coupling busbar."

"1","Do you 'think', therefore you 'are' and why?","","You are what u think thats why, U think what you are.\n\nSoul: Mind, Intellect and Personality\nEvery soul has three separate faculties which are inherent in all human beings irrespective of place of birth. Just as electrical energy produces warmth, sound or light depending on the device through which it passes, similarly, the energy of consciousness functions through three different but closely connected faculties, referred to respectively by the terms mind, intellect, and personality.\n\nThe Mind\nWith the power of the mind, one imagines, thinks and forms ideas. Thoughts are created in the mind. The thought process is the basis of all emotions, desires and sensations. It is through the minds that, in an instant, thoughts reach anywhere, a memory can be relived and the feeling of happiness or sadness is experienced. The metaphysical mind should not be confused with the heart, the physical organ that maintains blood circulation"

"2","What would happen if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning?","","None of us would have to worry about what we going to do the next day because we would all be dead.\n\nWhat would happen if the Earth stopped spinning?\nThe probability for such an event is practically zero in the next few billion years. If the Earth stopped spinning suddenly, the atmosphere would still be in motion with the Earth's original 1100 mile per hour rotation speed at the equator. All of the land masses would be scoured clean of anything not attached to bedrock. This means rocks, topsoil, trees, buildings, your pet dog, and so on, would be swept away into the atmosphere. \n\nIf the process happened gradually over billions of years, the situation would be very different, and it is this possibility which is the most likely as the constant torquing of the Sun and Moon upon the Earth finally reaches it's conclusion. If the rotation period slowed to 1 rotation every 365 days a condition called 'sun synchronous', every spot in the Earth would have permanent daytime or nighttime all year long. This is similar to the situation on the Moon where for 2 weeks the front-side is illuminated by the Sun, and for 2 weeks the back side is illuminated. This situation for the Earth is not the condition of 'stopped' rotation, but it is as close as the laws of physics will let the Earth get. \n\n \n\nIf it stopped spinning completely...not even once every 365 days, you would get 1/2 year daylight and 1/2 year nightime. During daytime for 6 months, the surface temperature would depend on your latitude, being far hotter that it is now at the equator than at the poles where the light rays are more slanted and heating efficiency is lower. This long-term temperature gradient would alter the atmospheric wind circulation pattern so that the air would move from the equator to the poles rather than in wind systems parallel to the equator like they are now. The yearly change in the Sun's position in the sky would now be just its seasonal motion up and down the sky towards the south due to the orbit of the Earth and its axial tilt. As you moved along constant lines of Earth latitude, you would see the elevation of the Sun increase or decrease in the sky just as we now see the elevation of the Sun change from a single point on the Earth due to the Earth's daily rotation. \n\nFor example, if you were at a latitude of +24 degrees North in the Summer and at a longitude where the Sun was exactly overhead, it would slide gradually to the horizon as Fall approached, but since the Sun has moved 90 degrees in its orbit, it would now be due west. Then as we approach Winter, you would now be located on the dark side of the Earth, and would have to travel in longitude to a location 180 degrees around the Earth to see the Sun 1/2 way up the sky because in the Winter, the Sun is 48 degrees south of its summer location in the sky. It's a little confusing, but if you use a globe of the Earth and orient it the right way, you can see how all this works out. \n\nAs for other effects, presumably the magnetic field of the Earth is generated by a dynamo effect that involves its rotation. If the Earth stopped rotating, it's magnetic field would no longer be regenerated and it would decay away to some low, residual value due to the very small component which is 'fossilized' in its iron-rich rocks. There would be no more 'northern lights' and the Van Allen radiation belts would probably vanish, as would our protection from cosmic rays and other high-energy particles. This is a significant biohazard."

What happens if I'm scared of telling someone the truth, because it can hurt their feelings, then is it okay? Or is it never okay, no matter what?","It depends on what the information is.\n\nIf you are simply sharing information about the person just to be negative about him or her, it's not okay.\n\nIf you are reporting something about the person for his/her or society's benefit, it might be okay.\n\nFor example, if you are saying to your coworker that you don't like so-and-so's outfit, it's not okay, because you are simply being negative for no apparent reason.  A friend of mine says a good rule of thumb for these is to never say anything about the person that you wouldn't say if he/she were there.\n\nIf you are reporting something about the person because you are trying to make life better for that person and/or society, it might be okay.  For example, if you know that your neighbor committed a crime, you might report it to the police without your neighbor knowing.  But you are doing it in the interest of a safer society.

"2","Do we really understand gravity at all?","Usually forces need to be integrated over a realistic, understood, volume, because their influence could come from all around a smaller object.  Unsually , gravity equations seem to be based from the centre of and object to the centre of another object using very basic equations.  With relation to this question;  Humans are very small!  The earth is very big!  How can the entire earth exert a gravity force on a human pulling it straight down toward the centre?  The only logical, sensible answers are either;\n1) Gravity is primarily exerted at the closest point of contact from both entire bodies (using the attraction of both).  There is some evidence of this - Stand on your tippi-toes it hurts!\n2) Gravity is somehow exerted from the centre of a body to the centre of another body.\nThink before you answer!  Gravity seems to have no reasonable range - otherwise planet size would be irrelavant to the gravity a person would feel standing on it.","No, physicists have always known that gravity is the one ""force"" that we really still don't understand. Now it is true that at macroscopic or large distance scales, we understand gravity very well through Einstein's General Relativity Theory. But at the quantum level, the scale of sub-atomic particles, we have no idea how gravity works there. And the most interesting thing is that when we try to probe and understand gravity at the quantum level, we find that we have to abandon all our currently understanding of space and time, as well as the notion of 3-dimensional space."

"2","What is  oxidative phosphorylation?","I need to know what oxidative phosphorylation is for my biology project I know that it is what the intermembrane space of a mitochondria does but I don't know what it is. Can someone help?","Oxidative phosphorylation is the terminal process of cellular respiration in eukaryotes. During oxidative phosphorylation electrons are transferred from NADH or FADH2 — created in glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism and the Krebs cycle — to molecular oxygen, via a series of protein complexes located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space as a result of this flow of electrons. This generates a pH gradient and a transmembrane electrical potential across the membrane. This is a form of potential energy which is referred to as a proton-motive force. The protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix via a large protein complex, ATP synthase. This is how most of the ATP is created in a eukaryotic cell. This is the reaction that ATP synthase catalyses:\n\n\n\n\nADP3- + H+ + Pi ↔ ATP4- + H2O \n\nThe synthase functions almost as a mechanical motor, with each NADH molecule contributing enough proton motive force to generate 2.5 ATP. Each FADH2 molecule is worth 1.5 ATP. All together, the 10 NADH and 2 FADH2 molecules contributed through oxidation of glucose (glycolysis, conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, and the Krebs cycle) account for 23 of the 30 total ATP energy carrier molecules. It is worth noting that these ATP values are maximum values and in reality protons leak across the membrane causing somewhat lower values.\n\nPhotophosphorylation, which occurs when plants synthesize glucose during photosynthesis, also uses ATP synthase and a proton gradient to generate ATP. The process occurs across the thylakoid membrane when chlorophyll is energized by light and donates an excited electron to an electron transport chain.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Inhibitors \n2 See also \n3 External links \n4 References \n \n\n\n[edit] Inhibitors\nThere are a few well-known toxins that affect the process of oxidative phosphorylation and can lead to breakdown of the chain:\n\nCyanide interrupts the electron transport chain in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion because it binds more strongly than oxygen to the Fe3+ (ferric iron ion) in cytochrome a3, preventing this cytochrome from combining electrons with oxygen. \nOligomycin functions by inhibiting the ATP synthase protein and preventing it from generating ATP from the proton gradient. \nCCCP (m-chloro-carbonylcyanide-phenylhydrazine) destroys the proton gradient by allowing the protons to flow out of the membrane. Without the gradient, the ATP synthase cannot function and ATP synthesis breaks down. \nA detergent, or substance that destroys cellular membranes by breaking apart their lipid bilayers, will destroy the membrane used in the process and prevent a proton gradient. \nRotenone prevents the transfer of electrons from Fe-S centers in Complex I (most notably) to ubiquinone. The electrons entering into Complex I are those derived from NADH, and provide the bulk of the reducing potential to the electron transport chain. \nFor each of these toxins, a backup will cause everything before it to break down as well. For example, if oligomycin is added, protons cannot pass through. As a result, the H+ pumps are unable to pass protons through because the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH and FADH2 are then not oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because there are no NAD+ and FAD coenzymes to be reduced."

"2","Does mercury literally melt gold to form an amalgam?","In recovery of gold, the raw material is typically treated with mercury, which forms an amalgam with the gold.  What is the actual process of ""forming an amalgam"".  Does this happen only between gold and mercury?","Miners used mercury (quicksilver) to recover gold throughout the western United States at both placer (alluvial) and hardrock (lode) mines. The vast majority of mercury lost to the environment in California was from placer-gold mines, which used hydraulic, drift, and dredging methods. At hydraulic mines, placer ores were broken down with monitors (or water cannons, fig. 1) and the resulting slurry was directed through sluices and drainage tunnels, where gold particles combined with liquid mercury to form gold-mercury amalgam. Loss of mercury in this process was 10 to 30 percent per season (Bowie, 1905), resulting in highly contaminated sediments at mine sites (fig. 2). Elevated mercury concentrations in present-day mine waters and sediments indicate that hundreds to thousands of pounds of mercury remain at each of the many sites affected by hydraulic mining.\n\n\nhope that helps"

This corresponds to approximately 13 x 1018cm3 of water. Now the questions looks like this: What would have happened if, during forty days and forty nights, 13 x 1018cm3 of water had fallen in the form of rain?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to know the surface area of the planet. It is approximately 510,067,000 km2. This corresponds to approximately 51 x 1017 cm2. If we imagine that the surface of the earth is completely smooth and that the oceans, seas, rivers, and streams are at the same level as the earth, then the water would reach a height that is provided by a simple equation, namely: \n\nV = A x h where V is volume, A is area and h is height. To obtain the height, the equation is as follows: h = V/A\n\nBy substituting V with the volume of existent water in the atmosphere and A with the surface area of the planet, we have: \n\nh = 13 x 1018cm3/51 x 1017 cm2 = 2.55 cm\n\nTherefore, if all of the existent water in the atmosphere were to fall upon the earth, independent of the amount of time it rained, the maximum height attained would be 2.55 centimeters, according to available data. We have now offered the first disagreement between the Bible and our current knowledge with respect to the deluge."

I'm not saying lets all go out and get stoned on LSD, but they were using it to uplift their minds, think outside the box, and LOVE LOVE LOVE all, aside from prejudice, hate, and war... up until Manson used LSD to hack into the ugliness inside of him and went on his sordid killing spree, and Janis, Jim and Hendrix all died at 26, and the pigs shot everyone; that's when the hope seemed to die inside of me...

"2","stars in blue light , red light?","why might ome stars appear double in blue light thought they could not be resolved in red light","2 more possibilities:\n - blue light is higher frequency, so its waves are smaller then red light, so you can resolve things that are close with higher frequencies.\n - if you are talking about using an amateur telescope, it is very hard to get all the colors of light to go thru lenses and then all be in perfect focus. Typically telescopes are able to perfectly focus only 1 color, and the other colors are very close, but not perfect.  Red, being at one end of the visable spectrum, would be less likely to be in perfect focus.  Violet it at the other end. Blue might be a bit better, but usually they build them to be perfect for green, as a 1/2 way point between red and violet."

There is enough gravity to pack it more tightly and this combined with roation of the object forms a round shape. Smaller objects like asteroids, comets and small moons often have irregular shape because there was not enough gravitational mass to compress the object into a round shape"

He burned in an ""F"" on his arm and it has definately left a blister.  Will it scar and be permanent?  The ""F"" looks like inflamed tissue that is red and swelling up.  This is the dumbest thing my brother has ever done.","It will leave a flat scar, which is likely to be lower than surrounding skin.  It will be white, as the fibroblasts making up the scar will not make melanin.\n\nIn Australia, many people have skin cancers removed with dry ice, at doctors' rooms.  It leaves unsightly blemishes, when done that way.\n\nYour brother MIGHT be lucky, and it MIGHT grow back as normal skin, if he did not leave it on the skin very long.  When it is used for cancers, the Dr needs to get to cells at the base of the skin cancer, so the whole thickness of skin must be injured.\n\nBTW, it is NOT a burn; it is a freezing injury."

What are the numbers?\n\n(4) Two numbers differ by 16 and their squares differ by 1,024. What are the numbers?","Let's take the nos. to be 'x' and 'y'. For all 4 cases the difference of their squares is 1024. Therefore, \nx^2-y^2=1024 \n\nor, simplifying further we get\n(x-y)*(x+y)=1024\n\nwhich is constant for all cases. Lets investigate case by case:\n\n\nCase(1): Difference between the numbers is 2.\n\nThis means (x-y)=2\nsubstituing in our main equation, we get:\n2*(x+y)=1024\n(x+y)=512\n\nNow we arrive at two simple linear equations:\n(x+y)=512\n(x-y)=2\n\nsolve for 'x' and 'y' from the above eqns to get:\nx=257, y=255\n\nThese are our numbers for case(1)\n\n\nCase(2): Difference between the numbers is 4.\n\nSame as above method, only that (x-y)=4. Solving for x,y we get:\n\nx=130, y=126\n\n\nCase(3): Difference is 8\n\nSolution: x=68, y=60\n\n\nCase(4): Difference is 16\n\nSolution: x=40, y=24"

Ceasar was the first emperor to kill Christians and then Nero who killed Peter and Paul and set Christians on fire as torches to make light for his chariot races on Vatican Hill. That's basically the only time. In some countries now you have some killings but not major ones. The Jewish people went through a hell of a lot more. Especially with Hitler. I don't know why people whine so much. Everyone believes in something different deal with it you know. Just because you don't think it's right doesn't make it wrong. To them your religion may seem weird. I have studied all the major religions and find them quit interesting. I can see the point that they are coming across with. I think the people who want to be ignorant should go do some research before they open their mouths. GOOD POINT!!!!!you made.\n\n\n\nand Genesis...i think you are the one who has to do some research. I don't know where you got your ideas from but they are not right. Other religions do not kill you for caring around the bible, a few countries do but thats not persecution. Muslims kill other Muslims for converting Christianity. Muslims don't like Christianity for the fact they think the trinity refers to three different people.. they are monotheistic. They don't kill us for caring the bible. As a matter of fact your not even allowed in Mecca, their holy city without being Muslim. DO SOME RESEARCH GESH!!!!!! And Jewish people do not believe in Jesus, they just think he was a jewish guy. And they weren't killed because they believed in the true god. Hitler just didn't like them.\n\n\nFirst of all just because a couple of thousand Christians are killed in other countries doesn't make it persecution we kill thousands of people of different religions with hate groups that are supposedly Christians and they don't call it persecution they call it justification. Now 6 million Jews being killed I classify as persecution. Grow up people\n\nSanta Claus was based on a real person St. Nicholas he had lots of money and used to go around at night and throw money into the houses of poor people.

But, like someone already stated, they believe that we were all brothers in sisters in the ""Spirit World"" (where our souls lived before getting a physical body here on earth).\n\nThey believe that there was a council in the Spirit World, where God (""Heavenly Father""), wanted to conceive a plan for humans to be able to return back to Him.\n\nAccording to Mormon belief, Satan's idea was to make everyone faithful to God and to not give free will to humans.\n\nHowever, Jesus' idea was to give humans the ability to choose with their hearts who to follow.  It basically was the concept that being worshiped by choice is much more rewarding than being worshiped by force or not having any other option.\n\nMormons believe there was a ""war in heaven"" between Jesus and Satan.  God chose Jesus' idea, which made Satan rebel.  While Jesus was made ""Savior,"" Satan was thrown out of heaven.  With him went 1/3 of the spirits - those who chose to rebel, as well."

He doesn't force anyone to love Him.  He lets us choose.  So, why did the sweet lady get her purse stolen?  Because that robber has the same choice that we all make: do we follow what God has told us in His instructions to us (the Bible), have we listened to Jesus and allowed Him to pay for our sins, and have we daily allowed the Holy Spirit to rule our lives?  \n\nSo because we all (even dedicated, born-again Christians) make mistakes, and fall away from God and His word, WE are choosing to live for Him or against Him.  God did make everything perfect- He said that it was after every day- even the sixth day when He made man.  \n\nTo put this all in perspective, though, this life is just a moment in time compared to eternity with Christ.  When we have a bummer week in this life, it seems to last for so long, but 10 years later, we only remember a bit of it.  Same is true when we will be praising God or be banished from His presence for eternity.  Then that will be perfect.  For always.  No more tears.  I have already been praying for you."

The controversy surrounds the use of cloning to produce ""identical organisms"" where the clone's cells can be used to produce talor made tissue.  I do not believe cloning is necessary to get stem cells to carry out genetic engineering.  THere are sources in the body to retrieve stem cells.  The problem is obtaining cells that have not specialized.  The less specialized the easier to make the cell transform into a specific cell for tissue growth.  Also, all cells contian the same copy of DNA.  I think it is only a matter of time before engineeris can stimulate a cell into changing into another cell.  Other than that there is nothing really controversial about genetic engineering."

The material should not be pulled too tightly. Start pouring water from the other beaker into the first through the layer of material as quickly as possibly but without spilling any water. Use the stopwatch to see how long it takes to transfer equal amounts of water. Relative permeability will be inversely proportional to the times. Water will not permeate latex rubber, if you try pouring it it will simply pool, giving infinite time and zero permeability. Pouring through the clothes the water will pool a little but still pass through, giving shorter times and higher permeabilities."

"1","R those crazy stories in the bible supposed to have happened?","all those fairytale types of stories is what im talking about. some say they are others say they arent.","The answer depends on which stories and the context in which you are asking.  Much of the Bible relates true history and has been documented by archealogical study.  Some Bible stories are exactly that, stories.  This doesn't mean they are not true in the theological sense.  They are stories told to relate a truth about God and his relationship with people.  Its like telling a story to illustrate a point.  The story may not be true, but the point the teller is making is true.  The key is to know what kind of story you are reading.  There are histories.  There is poetry.  There are songs.  There are philosophical dissertations.  Many forms of literature appear in the Bible.  When reading remember what the Bible is for.  God is trying to help us to know who he is and how he wants us to be.  If we read looking for the answer to these questions, ""Who is God?"" and ""Who are God's people?"" we will find that the answers found in the Bible are always true."

However, I can give you an example, so that you can create a formula for your state.\n\nSay the state uses 3 letters and then 3 digits.\n\nThe 3 letters each can be one of 26 values, and the 3 digits can each be one of 10 values.\n\nSo the formula would be 26x26x26x10x10x10 or 17,576,000.\n\nOf course, the state could choose to throw out obscene combinations of letters."

"2","How do I get nascent hydrogen using common materials in my backyard?","","I doubt you'll find it in your backyard.  Your best chances of getting hydrogen is electrolysis of water (pass a current through water and O2 will form at one end and H2 will form at the other--this is EXTREMELY dangerous, and should only be attempted with a battery so you don;t have live ends) or have zinc react with acid.  If you take a pennymade after about 1980, the entire interior is zinc, and it's very reactive--copper is just the coat.  If you scratch off the copper coat a bit to expose the zinc, and drop the penny in acid, it will react, creating bubbles of H2.  I don't know how you'd capture the bubbles, though.\n\nEdit: this is my 1,000th answer!  Hurrah!"

This implies that to calculate ln(y) for a given y>0, you can use finite approximations to the integral:\n\nintegral form 1 to y of 1/x = ln(y)\n\na very simple approximation is the following: for a given integer (big!) k of your choice, \n\nln(y) = sum for i=0 to k-1 of k/(k-i(y-1))\n\nHope this helps"
"1","What is Ramadan?","","Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim calendar. It is during this month that Muslims observe the Fast of Ramadan. Lasting for the entire month, Muslims fast during the daylight hours and in the evening eat small meals and visit with friends and family. It is a time of worship and contemplation. A time to strengthen family and community ties.\n\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Islam uses a lunar calendar—that is, each month begins with the sighting of the new moon. Because the lunar calendar is about 11 days shorter than the solar calendar used elsewhere, Islamic holidays ""move"" each year. In 2006 Ramadan will begin on Sept. 24.\n\nFor more than a billion Muslims around the world—including some 8 million in North America—Ramadan is a ""month of blessing"" marked by prayer, fasting, and charity. This year Ramadan precedes Christmas and Hanukkah. But while in many places these holidays have become widely commercialized, Ramadan retains its focus on self-sacrifice and devotion to Allah (God).\n\nWhy this Month?\n\n\nMuslims believe that during the month of Ramadan, Allah revealed the first verses of the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam. Around 610 A.D., a caravan trader named Muhammad took to wandering the desert near Mecca (in today's Saudi Arabia) while thinking about his faith. One night a voice called to him from the night sky. It was the angel Gabriel, who told Muhammad he had been chosen to receive the word of Allah. In the days that followed, Muhammad found himself speaking the verses that would be transcribed as the Qur'an. \n\nAt many mosques during Ramadan, about one thirtieth of the Qur'an is recited each night in prayers known as tarawih. In this way, by the end of the month the complete scripture will have been recited. \n\nFasting\n\n\nMuslims practice sawm, or fasting, for the entire month of Ramadan. This means that they may eat or drink nothing, including water, while the sun shines. Fasting is one of the Five Pillars (duties) of Islam. As with other Islamic duties, all able Muslims take part in sawm from about age twelve. \n\nDuring Ramadan in the Muslim world, most restaurants are closed during the daylight hours. Families get up early for suhoor, a meal eaten before the sun rises. After the sun sets, the fast is broken with a meal known as iftar. Iftar usually begins with dates and sweet drinks that provide a quick energy boost. \n\nFasting serves many purposes. While they are hungry and thirsty, Muslims are reminded of the suffering of the poor. Fasting is also an opportunity to practice self-control and to cleanse the body and mind. And in this most sacred month, fasting helps Muslims feel the peace that comes from spiritual devotion as well as kinship with fellow believers. \n\nEid al-Fitr\n\n\nRamadan ends with the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which in 2006 occurs on Oct. 24. Literally the ""Festival of Breaking the Fast,"" Eid al-Fitr is one of the two most important Islamic celebrations (the other occurs after the Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca). At Eid al-Fitr people dress in their finest clothes, adorn their homes with lights and decorations, give treats to children, and enjoy visits with friends and family. \n\nA sense of generosity and gratitude colors these festivities. Although charity and good deeds are always important in Islam, they have special significance at the end of Ramadan. As the month draws to a close, Muslims are obligated to share their blessings by feeding the poor and making contributions to mosques."

A perennial best seller, the book has been in continuous publication since it first appeared and has been translated into 18 languages. It is widely regarded as a modern spiritual classic.\n\nIn 1920, Yogananda was invited to serve as India's delegate to an international congress of religious leaders convening in Boston. His address to the congress, on ""The Science of Religion,"" was enthusiastically received. That same year he founded Self-Realization Fellowship to disseminate worldwide his teachings on India's ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its time-honored tradition of meditation.\n\nFor the next several years, he lectured and taught on the East coast and in 1924 embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. The following year, he established in Los Angeles an international headquarters for Self-Realization Fellowship, which became the spiritual and administrative heart of his growing work.\n\nThere is a course you can take to learn his meditation techniques.  It's a very accepting group.  I once belonged, when I was interested in learning more about that form of yoga and meditation."

I would start with ""Fear and Trembling,"" as it's accessible (although still difficult).\n\nTo a great extent, the freedom that God has given us does extend to our purpose.  The problem with ""The Purpose Driven Life"" and its ilk (and by the way, do you know *anyone* who has truly changed her/his life six months after reading this book?  I don't) is that it doesn't offer deep changes and insights.

"2","How do i use my brain efficiently?","i heard that a human being uses barely 20% of his brain.. how do i use at least 50% of my brain?\n\nhttp://www.blogcharm.com/jal","Okay.  This is a common misconception perpetrated by those wonderful PSAs with David Schwimmer and the likes.\n\nWhen scientists came out with research saying that you only use 20% of their brain, they meant that you only use 10-20% of your brain at any given time.\n\nSomehow, the media grabbed ahold of this and misinterpreted it to mean that you only use 20% of your brain in your lifetime.\n\nHere's how it actually works.  Throughout the course of a given day, you will use 100% of your brain.  Only about 15% or so is electrically active at any given point in time (for the average person).  Certain portions of your brain are active during certain activities, whether it be reading or riding a bike or anything else.\n\nThe magnificent thing about the brain is its efficiency.  If you do not use a set of neurons in the brain, they will disconnect from their neighboring neurons and sometimes die by apoptosis (mostly in development, but this occurs throughout life).  When a neuron pulls away from other neurons, more will extend to make new connections.  This way, the brain is constantly keeping otherwise unused portions used.\n\nSo to answer your question, you are already using 100% of your brain!  The real question here is: how do I use my brain's potential more effectively?\n\nWell, keep healthy, physically and mentally.  Exercise to keep your blood flowing to your brain, feeding it.  Drink water to help this process.  Do mentally stimulating activities: read books, write, paint, think of things!  Meditate!  Train your ability to focus on one thing at a time.  Train your ability to multitask.  Turn off the TV.  Go outside and enjoy nature.  Relax.  Help kids with their homework.  Study something.\n\n~The more you know\n\nlol"

"2","How much do they really pay a doctor?","","Well my mother is a phsycian. It really depends on a wide range of things. If you have your own practice, work for someone else, or a mix of both. It also depends on their speciality and level of skill. Physicians with a few years of experience can expect to start out at around $150,000 per year. The more specialized the doctor is the more money they make. Another large factor is location. In private practice it depends on how large the practice is and how many patients are seen and can be significantly more than the 150K. Doctors earn their money though. They work long hours, work hard, and put up with a lot of stress. Who would want to have to worry about saving lives every day.

The both give the same result."

HOW Frankenstien's monster is created is not the point, it's the consequences that the book explores.\nShelley would probably see genetic engineering as equivalent to other medical and bio-technology.  No better, no worse.  Frankenstien would still be relevant, as a warning about creating things we can't control.  However, I think she would be encouraged by the fact that many scientists have read, or are at least familiar with, Frankenstien.

""Well this isn't working, time to change tactics""\n\nDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is the definition of insanity!! \n\nComplaining however is whole different thing in itself..Is it really that you're complaining about it... or needing feedback from an outsider's view to see if your decisions are with sound reason..and as long as you're looking for more info on what went wrong..and learning from them.. \n\nGiving up that right to complain happens when you aren't at all conscience that you have any responsibility in what has happened .... blaming circumstances, blaming others, blaming anything else but what you've personally contributed that made this outcome a reality is what voids the complaint department to me.  And it's okay to complain about yourself, as long as you're learning what you did doesn't work, and try a new path next time, and if the same result happen again.. and you complain.. to me that means you're looking for someone else's view to help see what you might have missed in the situation.\n\nGood Example?..Well I am a work-a-holic, and help-a-holic, When I have time I give it.. and where I see troubles I try to help with it. My hubby's granny had many troubles with credit cards, bills, health and a live in son that most of the time wasn't employed..So I took every path imaginable to bring back value and calmness to her life, but you can't help those who won't help themselves.. so as much as I tried to help in different venues, it was fruitless...you can't invite a person to live with you to help them, for them to want to bring the problem with them to you. And I don't hear them complain anymore since my hubby and I have made several offers to help, and they don't accept those terms, it's the only terms we are able to give.

Secondly Judas describes Jesus in his Childhood, saying Jesus would kill another child if he angered him and would mould a pigion of clay an make it live. What are your thoughts? Heidi","Its a lot like anything else. You either have faith in it or you don't.  They did prove its authenticity.  They know it was around at 180Ce.  And they do have a point (those that have answered) that they cannot prove that what the contents say is fact. (meaning this is actually what was said and all that) However if you want to take that route we can say the same for the other Gospels. Those in the bible and those not.  The Gospels in the bible are just as old.  We were not there.  We take what the scriptures say on faith. (for those who believe) So this book is no different.)  I personally feel that this Gospel has a lot to offer in our understanding of Jesus and his Disciples.  Just as the Nag Hammadi Library and the Dead Sea Scrolls.  They give us more insight. More understanding.  And, I feel, They give us something to weigh against the Gospels and other books in the New Testiment."

Wouldn't you think they would question why the elder who convinces them to do it hasn't done it himself? Would be my first question","First of all, I think there are a lot of misconceptions about suicide bombings in the Muslim world. In Islam, if you commit suicide, then in the hereafter you are doomed to go through that death over and over again in whatever way you killed yourself. It is a major sin. \n\nHowever, the people who are doing suicide bombings are people living in desperate situations that you will probably never be able to understand. But let's just try to imagine that you are, say, a Palestinian whose house has just been torn down to make way for an Israeli settlement while your family was still inside and your little brother just died of appendicitis because the Israeli army wouldn't let the ambulance pass the checkpoint to get to the hospital. Or imagine that you live in Haditha, Iraq, and no one can go outside because the US army forces that came to save you from Saddam are having daily firefights outside your door with rebel leaders, and then one day one of their tanks gets hit and they get so mad that they storm your house and shoot everyone inside... mom, dad, babies, kids, grandparents... and then they go on to your neighbor's house and do the same. Or imagine that you live in Afghanistan where the Taliban have been pushed out of power, but that has left no real government in control and so your mom and your sisters can't leave the house because if any men find them on the streets they are likely to be raped and killed. These are real scenes from the daily life of thousands of people.\n\nNow...imagine that some other nation or group managed to destroy our central government and take over our country. Imagine that you lived every day in fear of those people, knowing that they suspect you of being up to no good just because you live here, watching them patrol your neighborhood streets with guns and tanks, seeing them try to question people who get scared and run and then are shot down in cold blood. Imagine that the idea of safety and comfort and home and family has been destroyed and replaced by fear and paranoia, by hunger and poverty and disease. Imagine after days and then weeks and then months and then years of this how desperate you would begin to feel. And yet, if you try to speak out against what is happening, then the world media labels you as an ""insurgent,"" and ""extremist,"" and a ""terrorist."" Imagine how your sense of patriotism and the need to protect to your family would drive you to take action... some action... any action.\n\nSo to answer your one-sided, uneducated question- it isn't so much a matter of old guys brainwashing young guys into comitting suicide, as much as entire societies that are in terrible situations and young kids who still have enough hope left that they can make a difference that they go out and do something desperate."

You really have put some thought into them.\nI also have a feeling that you know the answers to your own questions and ask them just to get people to think.\n\nI believe whole heartedly that some mental illnesses are spiritual conditions.  Have you ever wondered why more and more people are diagnosed with depression, ADD, bi polar, and other illnesses every year?\nI think it is a direct relation to the way God's influence is consistently less every year on society.  People are rejecting His laws and ways more aggressively and openly every year.\nIt's not that these people don't have the symptoms, but it is being misunderstood.\n\nNow, I do believe that some of these people really need medical help.  But many of them are in a bad spiritual state.  They lacked discipline as a child, they lacked good family upbringings, values, teachings, etc.  It all starts in the home.  And it will continue to get worse because the home is becoming more lost and wicked every year.\n\nThen you also have your bonafide posessions.  Remember that in the bible, Jesus rebuked many demons out of people who were lunatick.\nToday, those people are getting doped up instead of the demons cast out of them.  Their bodies are calm because of the drugs, but they are a spiritual mess inside.\n\nIf you look with the Spirit, you will know that some people that you meet are posessed.  I have met a few myself and have had confrontations with them spiritually.  It's not fun, let me tell you.\n\nI think the state of this world is in a mental illness.  Their logic and reason is anything but logical or reasonable.  The way society views and handles issues today is sickening.  \n\nI could go on and on about this, but I think you get the point I'm trying to make.\n\nI can guarantee you that you will never find a true Christian in a mental ward because they are not able to be posessed.  Except for real medical problems like Alzheimers and such, a true Christian is protected from spiritual illness.\n\nAs far as the chemical condition of the brain for people who are mentally ill, you have a cause and effect issue or ""chicken and an egg problem"".\nDid the chemicals cause the condition or did the condition cause the chemicals?  No one knows or will be ever able to answer."

ADNR can scratch natural diamonds, thus ADNR is harder than natural diamond and consequently more resistant against abrasion. \n\npolyyne, a superhard molecular rod comprised of acetylene units - that resists 40 times more longitudinal compression than a diamond. Ironically, these glittery gems are comprised from the element carbon and have the weakest type of chemical bonds, while polyyne has the strongest bonds in carbon chemistry. \n\nI wasn't able to find a comparison of polyyne and ADNR, but I believe ADNR was developed first and held the title until polyyne was developed a short time later. I'm not positive about the order though. Either one is harder than my head which is saying something."

"2","Why do penises grow?","Is it the hormones or what?  I need to know for a biology exam.","Penises grow from miniature in fetus to infant size to child size to adult size in males as a result of normal growth in size by cell number increases, esp during puberty due to dramatic increases in testoserone. Erect penises make penetration easier.\n\nPlease clarify ""grow"" or become ""erect-engorged"" \n\nEnlargement due to erections can occur at any stage of life from fetus stage on, including during the normal sleep cycle of any aged male (once every 60-90 minutes during sleep) regardless of sexual response, but is most easily-likely to engorge from puberty stages on through middle age during arousal phase of sexual response cycle. Erections are physiologically a sign of RELAXATION (blood flows in), and the beginning of arousal stage. Frequency and firmness of erections (and perceived NEED for sex) may or may not diminish from middle age on, depending on numerous factors. But testosterone assists with the frequency, duration and ease of erections.  Teens and 20s are the ages of highest testosterone, thus the ease-frequency-firmness of erections. \n\nPenises can also engorge-become erect rather ""spontaneously"" due to puberty surges of testosterone. Most males also notice erections in the morning as well.\n\nIf females take masculinizing hormones, within six months their clitoris may be as large as a human thumb."

At times, the god may be assumed, so we have names that contain the phrase ""god is gracious"", or ""whom god loves"", but here the term god undoubtedly refers not to an abstract deity but rather to a specific, assumed deity which might be a local god, or the god to whom the parents prayed. Much of the time, the god was named.\n\nCommon words or phrases were often used in names. These included ankh (life), mery (beloved), hotep (peace), nefer (beautiful) and khenemet (one who is joined with) \n\nMany names could be used by both males and females, and in these instances, an identifier, such as a hieroglyphic man or woman, was appended to the name in order to make it masculine or feminine. However, ""et"" on the end of a name, or sometimes in the middle of it, appears to have been a feminine identifier, and ""pa-sheri"" (masculine) or ""ta-sherit"" (feminine) was somewhat similar to the equivalent of ""Junior"" today. We also find Si, meaning son, or Sit, meaning daughter."

"2","How can animals without teeth eat? What are other means of mechanical digestion for animals?","","Think of whales. They have that siv-like stuff that strains krill and plankton stuff out of the water, to be swallowed and digested later.\n\nOk, now for a smarter explination: \n\nWhen humans eat, there's a lot more methods and reasons behind digestion than simply mechanical breakdown.\nFood starts in the mouth, where salivary amylaze, an enyzme, begins to break down starch. The mechanical process increases the surface area of the food, allowing a more rapid breakdown. Peristalsis moves food along the digestive track, partially digesting and absorbing along the way. In the stomach, chemicals from the gallbladder and pancreas are secreted to further breakdown food (with stomach fluid, ""acid chyme""), and specifically protein (by enzyme ""pepsin,"" thus the antacid medicine). This is known as ""chemical digestion."" Stomach muscles also aid in mixing digestive enzymes; this is what happens when your stomach lurches, bubbles (but gas can cause this also), ""talks,"" or churns. Next, as food travels to the small and then large intestine, fat in food is absorbed in the small and water in the large.\n\nSpecies vary in the ammount of breakdown needed for their body to absorb nutrients. This describes the function of most. On the whole, animals besides humans use teeth to intimidate predators and capture prey. Some snakes swallow eggs whole, and would use teeth only to defend against the mother bird. The venus fly-trap captures flies and then disables them without teeth. Spiders don't have teeth, persay, but poisonous fangs which disable their prey--you may recall that they merely ""suck"" the liquids out of their food. \nAnimals equipped with other mechanisms besides teeth to capture prey have no need for them to digest."
"2","Two ways in which the sequences of your DNA might affect your phenotype?","Also, why don't the repetive sequences described in the article seem to affect the carrier's phenotype?","The reason repetitive sequences often do not affect the carrier's phenotype is because many repetitive sequences are in what we know as ""introns"" or unexpressed regions of DNA. While our DNA contains an enormous amount of data, often only a small sequence of nucleotides is necessary to make the proteins that produce a phenotype. These active sequences are in expressed portions of the DNA, or ""exons."" In addition, sometimes a single strand of DNA carries sequences for many different types of characteristics in an individual, but have different portions of the DNA expressed. Therefore, what may be an intron for, say, eye color, may be an exon for hair color."

"2","Can u science experts help me with this q?","If so, can u answer one of these two questions or both. First question is (Compare and contrast what happens to an animal, a plant, and a Paramecium cell in a hypotonic, an isotonic, or a hypertonic solution) and the second question is (Could Elodea or Paramecium from a freshwater lake be epected to survive if transplanted into the ocean? Explain.","ok, so generally speaking, in the hypotonic environment, a cell is swell up, and potentially burst. The way to remember this is that hypO (the letter O)tonic is the cell which is normally drawn as a more squarelike shape becomes circular as it takes on water. In an isotonic solution, the environment and the cell have equal solutes so no movement of water occurs. In a hypertonic solution (lots of particles in the environment) so the water leaves the cell and shrivels up. \nHowever, we also have to take into account the type of cell that we are placing into these environments. The above applies to animal cells and paramecium as they don't have rigid cell walls. However, plant cells do have cell walls so it does not apply to them. Plant cells have what we call turgor pressor, so they can withstand the environmental influences, or changes in tonicity, alot better. When the plant takes on water, it has the cell wall to prevent bursting. When the plant cell looses water, the cytoplasm shrinks while the cell wall keeps the cell's shape.\n\nQuestion 2:\nIf you were to place elodea or paramecium from fresh to salt water:\nwhen elodea is placed in salt water, we observe the process of plasmolysis - shrinkage of cell contents due to water loss.\nfor image see:\nhttp://images.apple.com/education/solutions/iwork/lessons/media/RealWorldScienceSample.pdf\n\nWith Paramecium: it has 2 contratile vacuoles that are used to balance salt concentration by expelling water"

The center of the Earth is very very very hot and a lot of substances (a lot of it being Iron (Fe) )are in molten form down there......Have you ever seen a volcano errupt (on a documentary or in a film?)? Well that stuff coming out is Molten Lava and is a mixture of substances (mostly rock) in liquid form. You cant get too close or you'll burn from the heat. I would go on telling you about this but then we'll be talking about another subject.\n\nThe gravitational pull of the Earth is because of its mass AND because of its rotation around the sun and itself. All bodies in the universe have a gravitational force and this force effects every other ""body"" in the universe (a bit like a draw in a tug-o-war) (This also explains why matter never can be completely annihilated and other aspects like the existence of dark matter and so forth....but that's advanced Astro-physics) \nThis gravitational pull is measured in NEWTONS (Newton is the guy that laid down the laws of gravity after an apple fell on his head.....) You'd weigh differently on each planet due to its MASS. For example if you where to lift a matchbox on Jupiter you would need a lot of help because it would weigh a lot more then it does here.....and so would you. So much so that your skeleton would not be able to support you and you would probably crumple into a meat heap......(i'm not going into detail because this will just go on and on to knew subjects.....you can find this info on the internet.....it's more fun to find out for yourself)\n\nI hope I've been helpful......."

"1","A Serious Question here. I am openning a kind of Debate.?","Why is it that on IM services, people from third world countries are ignored? All that they are trying to do is to make friends all over, but they are given poor response, sometimes even by looking at their country name. They are not even given a chance to prove if they are good or bad. In my personal opinion, they end up acting in a negative way, impersonating as someone they are not. This thing is resulting in increasing number of Liers on internet. Any ideas/opinions/sugessions as to why such classified treatment is given to third world people?","Well, I have some ideas as to why you perceive this to be the case, whether or not it is.  A great many people on the Internet (I do not have IM, so I'm speaking more generally) are using English as a second language.  If they take their time, really carefully compose their sentences, we wouldn't even know that they had not been using English for many years.  Their English teachers would be very proud of them.  But IM goes too fast for that; you have to be quick to keep up with the dialog.  So a non-native speaker who has not been using English very long will start to get incomprehensible.\n\nOf course, there is also some hostility and resentment on the part of some people toward what they feel is an ""invasion"" from ""foreigners.""  In any country with a good bit of socialism (housing, medical care, whatever), it is easy to feel that the newcomers are getting preferential treatment over the citizens.  I know this has happened a great deal in England, for example, and to a lesser but still noticeable degree in the US.  This builds up an attitude that anyone from a third world country who tries to learn English is trying to ""come over here and use up our scarce resources.""  It may or may not be true of a given person, and there's no reason to assume it is true, but the inflated bureaucracy that is in place to ""care for"" immigrants is horribly expensive, and breeds resentment."

Also notice that if you add two numbers together then to find the remainder when divided by three you only need to add remainders. So for example13 can be written as 10 + 3.  Looking only at remainders this is 1+0 =1 so the remainder when 13 is divided by 3 is 1.  You can reduce a number by 30 without affecting the remainder so higher numbers such as 50 can be reduced by 30 without affecting the remainder.  So you can see how numbers below 100 can be checked this way.\n\nNext notice that a number whose leading digit is one followed by zeros must have remainder 1 when divided by 3.  Take one from this number to get a digit whose numbers are all 9 and this is obviously divisible by 3.  This fact allows us to extend the reasoning we went through for 10, 20 etc to all higher numbers.\n\nThis explanation may be a bit hard going but hopefully it will be some sort of inspiration for your understanding."

"2","What are the different branches of biology?","","""Branches of Biology\nBecause there is such a huge variety of living things on the earth, the science of biology has many different branches and areas of study. Depending on their discipline, biologists usually research one or more of the following categories: \n\nMicrobiology, a study dealing with the structure and existence of microorganisms, which are tiny life forms such as a bacteria or a virus; \nZoology, which is the study of animal life; \nBotany, which is focused on plant life; \nAnd physical anthropology, where scientists study human life, such as our existence and how we interact with other life forms. \nBiologists also use other sciences to research life. Without chemistry and physics, much of the knowledge we have gathered about life would have been impossible to collect. \n\nIn an effort to answer the “what is life” question, much of the history of biological study has been focused on trying to classify and define life forms. The four categories above led to the development of many subcategories as biologists learn more about the depth and complexity of living things. Some of the other subdivisions of biology are:- \n\nPhysiology\nStudy of the vital functions and basic activities of living organisms - cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems - and their parts, in relation to the whole. \nEmbryology\nStudy of the formation and development of organisms from the zygote, or fertilised egg. Confined mainly to multi-celled organisms. \nTaxonomy\nHierarchical classification of natural organisms indicative of their structures and differences. \nGenetics\nStudy of inheritance and variation in organisms, and mechanisms by which these operate; causes of similarities and differences among related individuals. \nEcology\nStudy of relationships between organisms and their environment; the interactions of individuals within groups and with their suroundings. \nMorphology\nThe study of the shapes of plants and animals. \nMolecular Biology\nStudy of chemical processes at the level of large organic molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. \nBiochemistry\nStudy of the chemical processes within living systems as a whole. \nMicrobiology\nThe study of micro-organisms - their structure, function, and significance."""

"2","What is the reason to put stone pieces (metal) under and around the railway lines.?","","Track ballast, consisting of gravel, cinders or other aggregate, forms the trackbed upon which railroad ties are laid. It is used to facilitate drainage of water, and to create an even running surface. This also serves to hold the track in place as the trains roll by. Such a track is also used to bring the Space Shuttle to its launching pad.\nIn the early days of railroads, much material for ballast came from rock found in the local area. In the Midwest, for example, much use was made of granite, while states in the southeast, such as Florida, made use of limestone. One specific type of granite used in the Midwest earned the name ""Pink Lady"" due to its color; in other areas, the ballast can be a mix of light and dark colors called ""Salt and Pepper""."
"2","Do centipedes really have 100 legs and millipedes 1,000?","","Some centipedes have hundred or more legs but no millipedes got a thousand.\n \nCentipedes (Class Chilopoda) are fast-moving venomous, predatory, terrestrial arthropods that have long bodies and many jointed legs. How many legs a centipede has depends on its species and age. Despite their name, which stems from the Latin words 'centum' (meaning 'hundred') and 'ped' (meaning 'foot'), thus mean ""hundred legged"" not many centipedes actually have as many as that number. Some have as few as 15 pairs, others have as many as 173 pairs, but most sorts have about 35 pairs. They normally have around half that number of legs, though it is possible to find centipedes with over 200 legs. Centipedes are highly segmented but with only one pair of walking legs per segment.\n\nMillipedes (Class Diplopoda, previously also known as Chilognatha) are very elongated arthropods with cylindrical bodies that have two pairs of legs for each one of their 20 to 100 or more body segments (except for the first segment behind the head which does not have any appendages at all, and the next few which only have one pair of legs). Each segment that has two pairs of legs is a result of two single segments fused together as one. The millipede's most obvious feature is its large number of legs. If you want to know how many legs a millipede has, count the number of body segments and multiply by four. Its name is a compound word formed from the Latin roots milli (""thousand"") and ped (""foot"") meaning ""thousand foot"" but these creatures do not have a thousand legs, although there are rare species  like ""Illacme plenipes"" that have up to 750 legs.( Illacme plenipes, typically have more 650 legs; the leggiest ever found in 1926 had 750.  However, common species have between 80 and 400 legs.♥"

"1","Poll – How do you interpret this Scripture passage about women?","NOTE: Below is the particular passage… but more reading maybe required.\n\n1 Corinthians 14:33-35\n[33] For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints, [34]  women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.  [35]  If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.  (NIV)\n\nPossible Interpretations:\n\nA) Women should not speak at all… in gathered assemblies. \n--- Which, to me, doesn’t make sense --- in light of 1 Corinthians 11:5\n\nB) Women are supposed to show respect and not disrupt the assembly by noisy discussions, talking in the background, and etc.\n\nPlease try your best to prove your point --- your thoughts in this matter are important.","This passage has gotten a lot of attention over the years - It seems everyone knows this passage - whether they know anything else about the Bible or not!\nMany (most?) overlook the fact that this command does not stand alone. Paul had already given this command for silence twice in the same passage - once applied to those who speak in tongues, and once to the prophets, and finally to the women. In all three cases, a close examination of the original language will show that the exact same words are used each time, however, most translations render it differently for the command to women.\nIn these three verses, ""be silent"" had to do with taking turns. It is not a unilateral command to for all time - it is a call for order and direction; for the proper use of the giftings God has bestowed on the various members of the church.\n\nPaul was making sure that women were not left out of the church! He knew that they were at a disadvantage in the culture, with little (closer to NO) opportunity for education. Paul sought to eradicate that, so that by their husband's instruction, they could function as peers. This might seem like a small thing today, but at that time it was HUGE. Even while he was correcting the chaos of the church, he was providing a way for the women to better themselves. His words were not harsh authoritarianism, relegating women to to some narrow role. On the contrary, they were opening new doors of opportunity for those who society had excluded and ingnored.\nClose examination of other Scriptures will reveal that Paul considered, Chloe, Priscilla, Stephana, and Phoebe, to be Annointed by God to leadership positions withing the church.\nPriscilla instructed Apollos, and neither Luke, nor Paul criticized this fact.\nThere is considerable evidence to suggest that Priscilla could have been the writer of the book of Hebrews.\nPaul even mentions pointedly that Phoebe was a deacon of the church in Chencrea."

He started off as a butcher's assistant in Lithuania and when he got to the states received employment immediately at Lemanoski's Butcher Block in downtown Milwaukee...hence his love for good Kielbasa. \n\nStash was always a good accordion man. He started off with the usual Polkas, but grew more in love with the rap scene \nthere in Milwaukee. You might know Milwaukee is considered one of the hotbeds of rap. He and the boys from the Butcher Block had many a jam session in the chopping room of the shop. Stash, God bless him, would keep that bloody apron on and let the music flow. Many a good time was had with the Old Milwaukee beer and Kielbasa. \n\nIt was there in the back room of the butcher shop that Stash and the boys came up with ""Play That Funky Polka\nWhite Boy"" a song that flew to the top of the charts. The rest is history from there. This summer, Stash will be \nposthumously inducted into the Polka Rap Hall of Fame \nin Scranton, Pennsylvania. \n\nOur family is all so proud."

"2","can a woman who is not pregnant and hasnt been pregnant in over 17 years encourage breast milk to be produced?","trying to find out if its possible for a female to produce milk without being pregnant ....so she can still breast feed","Tough one...in order to produce breast milk, first there must be an increase in the number and size of mammary ducts and glands within the breast. Then you'll need prolactin, a hormone from the pituitary gland, to stimulate production of breast milk. Lastly, secretion of breast milk largely depends on oxytocin (the letdown reflex). All of these hormones are greatly increased during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and non-pregnant serum prolactin and oxytocin levels are actually pretty low. As such, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a non-pregnant woman to prodice breast milk."

I love my husband very much and I thank Allah everytime I make dua for letting me meet my husband and for finding Islam. When I met my husband he was just my boss at work and we became friends. I wasn't Muslim and after work we would go get coffee and talk about religion, politics and other things as friends. After about 3 months of knowing him I converted to Islam and he was happy for me, he was a good Muslim at the time. But after 1 year of being married, he has started to do haram things. He is constantly flirting with girls online, not praying, he has made jokes sometimes that he is Christian (he stopped because when he was joking like that, he got very sick and had to go to the hospital and he knew it was punishment from Allah) constantly starting fights with me when I point out what he is doing is against Allah\nAny advice on how to get back my pious husband who I fell in love with? Any discriminatory questions will be ignored.\nThank you..","Assalamu' Alaikum Sister!\n\nPray to Allah (SWT) to guide Him and turn him towards Him. You should also talk to him on your own and tell him that his actions are hurting his deen and you. Listen to Islamic lectures with him, either in a Masjid or at home on tapes. Encourage him to pray by telling him of its rewards and punishments. Tell him about the sin of flirting with the opposite gender (fornication of eyes, hands, etc.). \nThere is also this website you can go to and order a book called ""a gift to bride"". It's a really good book that can guide any married woman. And it only costs about $9. The website you can get it from is www.madania.org and then go to library.\n\nThere is also another website with a huge section on marriage.\nhttp://lightuponthetruth3.tripod.com\n\n\nPS: also you should consult a pious person aobut your husband declaring himself as a christian. He might have to repeat his shahadah if he said it in consciousness. Tell him all of his words will be accounted on the dDay of Judgment!\n\nInshallah, best of luck to you!\nMay Allah (SWT) accept your duas. ameen.\n\nlovingly yours,\nsister in islam"

"2","Why is the Tone of Microphone Feedback ""High Pitched""???","O.K. I have a good idea that Microphone feed back is caused by sound looping into the Mic out of the Speaker and back into the Mic and so on and so on. But why is the the tone so high pitched?","Aside from circuitry considerations (which can not be ignored) short waves are more penetrating than long waves.  For example light waves and X-rays are both electromagnetic but the shorter X-rays can penetrate flesh and bone.  short UV waves penetrate clouds to give you a sunburn on a less than sunny day.  Short microwaves penetrate food in an oven right through the container.  A piccolo can be heard easily above an entire marching band (as in Stars and Stripes Forever).  Therefore, the microphone is more apt to ""hear"" higher tones and amplify them even more than low tones and hear them from the speaker even louder, etc. etc."

Some places it got messed up and modified, sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.  When we look at figures like Noah and Abraham, they knew the stories and held on to the faith that had been passed to them, where as others didn't.  They added there own stories and eventually it all got written down.\n\nI am sure you know stories of your own family that go back generations but have never been written down.  You can see the variation in the story that each branch of your family tells.\n\nWhere Revelation comes in (and this is where it is often gotten wrong) is that it confirms the story and brings it to a higher plain of understanding.  It is not like the Hebrews didn't know the Genesis account and the book fell out of the sky one day and hit Moses on the head.

The answer you are refering to mentioned potatos to make a battery not a photovoltaic cell.\n\nPotatos and lemons, and all fruits and vegetables for that matter, store solar energy from photosynthesis.  This however is not photovoltaic as electricity is not generated at all during photosynthesis.\n\nYou can however create batteries with copper, zinc, and a potato, lemon, or banana.

So can we say that all the name of GODS mentioned in the different religious books (ALLAH, LORD, JEHOVA etc.) designate the same power?? If it is true so why there is so much hate between religions??","A very good question.\nThere are several questions within your one. \nI believe: ( through research and not belonging to any one religion)\n\nReligions define God by a name which is inherent in the human mind to tag something to understand it( tree, dog, human).  With the understanding of infinite thought and probabilities the One religions refer to is the same God.  The Source.  The source of light, dark and all existence.  This is one entity or energy.  \n\nThe paths we as humans choose to find this source is our differing religions each with their merits and flaws.  We seek the same source.  Eventually. \n\nThe Source is no 'man' or 'woman' sitting on a throne being wise, judge mental and all knowing it (It) is simply everything.  That was, will be, is or may be.  It is the fabric which which binds everything.  Before man began to categories or define it.\n\nThe second question within yours hints at the 'prophets' question of the being the only way to the Source. Jesus, Mohamed, Quetzalcoatl, Buddha etc. (note we are speaking only of the prophets of Light) each proclaim that their way is their path God. The ultimate source.\n\nHumans are different in their perceptions of everything so it is reasonable that God would have conceived of different paths to reach the One, ie enlightenment."

"2","Why does sound travel faster through a less dense gas, but also faster through water than air?","Sound waves travel faster through MORE dense fluids, such as water, and solid objects than through the air, and also travel faster through LESS dense fluids (helium) than through air. why?","Sound travels faster through water because the particles in water are already touching each other (in gases the particles are all spread out). [the other answers have dealt with this in more detail]\n\nHelium is less dense than air becuase helium molecules weigh less than regular air molecules (a molecule of helium is two helium atoms, so its atomic weight is 2x 2 = 4. Air is mostly nitrogen, with molecular weight 2x 14 = 28).\n\nHowever, the molecules in helium are almost exactly as close together as the molcules in air. In fact, in any gas, one mole of molecules takes up the same amount of space - 24 litres at standard temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\nSo, sound can travel faster through helium because the particles are the same distance apart as air, but they are lighter so it is easier to get them moving."

"1","True or false are women much cleaner than men?","","Anytime a man and a woman are together, the potential for magic or mayhem exists. Our world has yet to accept the very special gift we’ve been given in being so different. We have not learned to utilize the awesome power available to us in the man-woman dynamic. There are many games to play in this world, but nothing can bring more joy than the man-woman game. There is no finer playing field than relating with the opposite sex to experience all aspects of love and life.\n\nIn order to effectively relate to one another, we must understand and appreciate, the underlying makeup of men and women. Women bring the appetite and desire to the planet. Men bring their capability to produce. In order to move efficiently around the game board of man-woman, we need to recognize women are better than men in the area of desire, and men are more effective than women in producing to satiate those desires.\n\nWe were not created different by accident. The plan has always been perfect, but we have resisted the perfection of our differences. This resistance has been the source of the majority of man-woman breakdowns.\n\nWomen are best at what they want. Men are best at making it happen. Women are the ones who wanted indoor plumbing. Women are the ones who wanted beds up off the floor. They wanted a roof over their head. They wanted more blankets and food for their children. Women are the ones who wanted transportation and markets to do their shopping. They wanted materials to make different clothes; ones for winter and ones for summer. Women have always wanted their basic needs of food, shelter and clothing met. Women wanted, and men provided. Life was simple. It’s not to say that women didn’t make things happen along the way. The truth is, women made everything happen simply by expressing their desires. They wanted more pleasurable experiences.\n\nTimes have changed, and the women of today need to allow men to be men, and empower them to do more of what they do best. Men want women to know they are completely capable of producing whatever women want and need, as long as they are given the opportunity.\n\nOver the past several decades, women have taken on more of the male role of producing. If this continues, we will end up with too much male energy on the planet. The planet doesn’t need more male energy - it needs more feminine energy.\n\nWomen are coming into their power in new and wonderful ways. It’s time for them to pull back from producing so much, and move more into directing. This will allow men to support women in moving things in the direction of the feminine. This will bring balance back to a world where the feminine energy is wanted and needed.\n\nRomance goes out the window when women take on a man’s role. In the times when chivalry was alive and well, women were definitely more feminine. They were happy to be female. They played their part with grace and ease. Men were heroic and romantic. They were happy to court women and women were delighted to be courted. Can you imagine if women were galloping off to slay dragons for their men? When women do the man’s job, it leaves little room for men to be their heroes. There is no game to play, or dragon to slay. It results in no romance.\n\nMark lived in Texas with Allison. Allison had a vacation magazine that had a beautiful picture of an island with gorgeous turquoise waters. She lit up every time she looked at it. One day Mark said to her, “Would you like to go there?” She said, “Yes, that would be like a dream.” That was all she said. The next day Mark bought tickets for them to go. She was simply enjoying the picture and thinking about how much fun it would be to go there. She was not trying to manipulate him in any way. This is different than a woman who asks, “Would you take me there?” or, “Why can’t we go?” There’s no opportunity for men to be the hero if women get their own ‘production’ muscle involved.\n\nWhen a woman expresses her desires, sh"
"1","Please Help?","Okay I'am writing an essay for my health carwe college course, and I just need to know what does Le medidecine liberale mean? its french I think it means the lberal medicine, but I cld be wrong, and what does it symbolizes? is it a special saying?","In contrast to Britain, following the Second World War, France was not a pathbreaker in the domain of social policy. Although the Laroque Report was instrumental in laying the foundations for a social security system based on the notion of national solidarity, unlike the Beveridge Report, it did not reassess the role of the State in assuming responsibility for the general welfare (2). Nor was its influence as broad as that of the Beveridge Report. Whereas the British State increased its control over the health system in one swoop through the nationalization of hospitals and the creation of the NHS in 1948, the French State increased its control more gradually while involving business groups - the palronal - and trade unions in the management of the social security system. As a result of exercising such prudence before tampering with (lie financing of medical care, the French health system is char acterizcd by the co-existence of NHI and private medical practice under fee-for-service reimbursement - what the French call la medecine liberale.La medecine liberale  \n       As far as the provision of medical services is concerned, in French - particularly the medical ambulatory care sector, the French profession - are deeply attached to a set of principles associated with la medecine liberale: selection of the physician by the patient and vice versa, clinical freedom for the doctor, professional confidentiality and, above all, fee-for-service payment. In the hospital sector, the French are committed not merely to the co-existence of public and private non-profit hospitals but also to proprietary hospitals (cliniques) which account for almost 20 per cent of the total number of beds. \n       La medecine liberale can be traced to an often idealized past when the health sector was a cottage industry. Office and home visits were the predominant modes of medical practice and physicians were neither concerned about primary prevention such as occupational health programmes, nor about the diffusion of medical technology, nor about regional teaching hospitals. Since the passage of the first health insurance law in 1928, French professional medical associations have sedulously cultivated an image of the personal, symbiotic doctor-patient relationship. The principles of la medecine liberale were first elaborated in a document called la Charle Medicale, in 1927. In 1955, they were codified by executive decree in the 'Code de Deontologie Medicale.'  \n       Despite the strength and centralization of French public administration, there are few countries where private fee-for-service practice has been more established than in France. Since the Second World War, however, as in other industrially advanced nations, French physicians have practised in a socio-economic context whose growth and changing patterns have transformed the health sector from a cottage industry to a major industrial complex. In the face of such change, the French state has wavered between protecting the prerogalives of la medecine liberale and adapting the health sector to the demands of a modern economy. On the one hand, policymakers have acceded to pressures from the medical profession and the hospital industry; on the other, they have' protected the right of access to medical care by extending health insurance coverage and introducing controls over physicians and hospitals."

There may be two reasons:  (1)  The person has reached a high level of consciousness and believes he can do no harm (to himself) by leaving this body - and, perhaps, feels he must ""go beyond"" to learn more; (2)  The person has reached a false state of nirvana and, during a brief ""high"" (peaceful state), he decides to ""go beyond"" thinking it is even more peaceful (and longer lasting).\n\nIn the case of #1 above, the question arises ""When does one 'know' he has reached the True state of Nirvana - that is, the highest level of heaven or personal peace.

"2","how does the brain, which part, tell the heart to beat and how does the heart pump blood back to the brain?","","The basic heartbeat is controlled by cells in the heart which have leaky membranes-Ions leak in, and depolarize the cell, which then causes a rapid spreading contraction.  Thus, the brain does not control basal heartrate.  The brain, through mediation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system can, however, modulate the rate of the heartbeat.  There are some specific loci which are associated with these systems, but the most potent is the emotive centers of the brain, which in turn are regulated by the cerebral cortex (the ""thinking"" part of your brain), which is why, when you are told you just flunked a test, your heartbeat rises, while when you listen to relaxing music, your heartbeat slows.  The conscious part of your mind sends signals to the emotive centers, which then regulate the symapthetic and parasympathetic system.  But, cutting off your head will not stop your heart from beating...at least not until the heart itself runs out of oxygen because of the lack of breathing."

"2","would u help me with the algorithm of maze robots?","I have robotic compitition next month \ncould u help me with the algorithm of maze robots?","MAZE NAVIGATION ALGORITHM\n\nPart 1\n\n    A guaranteed way to to solve a maze is to stick to a wall and always try to turn one direction or the other.  It is not the most efficient way but it works all the time.  This is how the Boe-Bot solves mazes.  It hugs the left wall.  IR sensors are mounted on the left and front sides of the robot.  It begins the maze with a forward movement.  After that it checks the left IR.  If left is open, it turns left, moves forward, and repeats the process.  If left is closed, the robot checks the front.  If front is open, the robot moves forward and repeats the process.  If the front is also closed, the  robot turns right.  It then checks the front IR sensor to determine if the new front is open.  If its open, the robot moves forward and repeats the process.  If it is closed, the robot again turns right and moves forward (the way it just came) and repeats the process.  The flow chart summarizes all these instructions.  Each time the robot makes a movement (forward, left, or right) it records a F,L, or R to a memory block in the EEPROM by using the WRITE function in Stamp BASIC.  The variable 'total_moves' is incremented each time a movement is written.  \n\n    The forward, left, and right subroutines use the PULSOUT function to move the servos.  The pulsout variables for each servo (eg. 699, 879) are not set in stone.  They have been changed numerous times and will probably need to be played with more.   We determined them partly by experiment and largely by trial and error.  The results of those experiments are also published in this site.  \n\n    At the beginning of the forward subroutine is the BUTTON function.  Each time through this subroutine, the programs checks to see if the button has been depressed.  If it has not, the program continues.  If the button has been pressed, control is moved to the find_RR subroutine.\n\nPart 2\n\n    When the program enters part 2, the robot has already left the maze and the button has been pressed.  It enters the find_RR subroutine and first pauses for 10 seconds so the robot can be repositioned at the starting point to re-do the maze.  Find_RR is a superfluous piece of code that originated from poor planning.  It reads in the movement from each memory block and the following memory block (blocks n and n+1) and compares them to each other.  If it detects a R,R combo, it replaces the first R with an A.  It then copies each movement into the previous one.  For example, it would change a FFRRFLF to a FFAFLF.  Each time it finds an RR combo and replaces it with an A, all the code following the last R must be adjusted. Therefore, the 'total_moves' variable is reduced by 1 each time RR is detected.  The write_A subroutine handles that task.  If no RR combo is found (they've all been switched) control moves to the find_A subroutine.\n\n    Find_A searches each memory block for the 'A' movement.  If no 'A' is found, control moves to the done subroutine.  However, this will only occur after all the 'A' have been dealt with.  When an 'A' is found, the memory location is stored in variable 'counter' and control goes to subroutine surround_A.  The purpose of surround_A is to determine all of the movements before and after the 'A' that need to be ignored for successful completion of the maze.  \n\n    After the robot completes the maze for the first time, and changes the 'RR' to 'A' the code will something like:\n\n        F F F L F A F R F F L F  this is for the hypothetical situation shown here:\n\n\n\n To eliminate the unwanted code, the pairs of movements surrounding A are examined and compared to the green, blue and purple patterns.\n\nF                F                F            L                F            A                F                R                F                F            L            F\n\n0                1                 2            3                4   "

Actually, I don't hear anything about Hinduism, either, but I  hear NEVER about the Jewish religion or ever see them anywhere.","Several of us will pop up when we see the word Jewish, Judaism, Torah, etc. in the question.  I for example just found your question by putting the word ""Jewish"" in the search for open questions.  I used to scroll through all the questions but that has become too tedious lately and I don't answer on Christian or general Bible matters because I have no need to impose my beliefs on anyone else. \n\nPersonally I think it's time there were subcategories under R&S, so that we can all have a forum to discuss things without constantly being interrupted by people who are not respectful.  To me that's like someone going into a section on mathematics and saying ""i hate math"".  If you don't like the topic, just stay away.  For example when someone asks a question about Jesus, I don't think it's necessary for someone atheist to comment, ""he's a figment of your imagination"" and by the same token I as a Jew, would NOT comment ""he's not the messiah"" even if that's what I believe.  I don't feel it's my place and it is not relevant to the question being asked. Everyone has a right to their beliefs and I don't need to chime in with my opinion every two seconds.  In fact the ones who do this are probably insecure with their belief systems and feel a need to be loud about it.   \n\nAnd for questions asked about Judaism I only answer the ones asked respectfully.  You can tell when someone really wants to know or they just want to spout their own prejudices and are not open to answers. If you scroll through my answers you can see I have answered many questions on Judaism that were asked in a thoughtful and respectful manner.\n\nWell, I hope that answers your question somewhat... :)"

"2","what are some differences between saturn and jupiter?","i know there are many similarities, but i can't find any differences","Off the top of my head: both are ""gas giant"" planets, but Jupiter is WAY bigger. Jupiter has a ton of satellite moons orbiting around it. Saturn has that weird-ass ring going around it which they just discovered is not a ring but more a like a spiral. Jupiter has this storm that never ends, that looks like a spot. Imagine a hurricane that never ended on Earth. Also Saturn has a heavy core for some reason. You could probably land on Saturn, but not in Jupiter. I wonder what it looks like when you land there."

"1","which parts of your cultural identify do you identify with the least? why?","","'Cultural': relating to the habits, traditions and beliefs of a society.\n\n'Identity': who a person is, or the qualities of a person or group which make them different from others.\n\nNow, culture provides:\n1. a particular view or understanding of the world. \n2. rules and patterns of behaviours.\n\nThe mexican culture is a clash of two different cultures that fusioned.  \n\nIn mexico there is a high regard for parties and celebrations... we even celebrate the day of the deads... and I don't feel identified with this traditions and behaviours because I don't agree with making a big celebration of 'nothing'... Low-income people spend all their savings in weedings and parties that they give to their relatives or extended family and even neighbours just because it gives them status... how silly!  I do not identify with that but I understand it.  Also mexicans are always 'worried' about the future and they daydream about winning the lottery... or that things will come from heaven... they never take their present and plan from it... they built up on water, as it were, and I'm not like that.  Also mexicans are too religious but they are religious because 'yes'... Do you believe in GOD? 'yes' Why? 'I don't know but I believe'... hmmm I'm not like that... Also mexicans say that it is better to do something even if it is not well done but it is done... and I think that if you are to do something (anything) you have to do it in the best possible way.  Also mexicans have a saying 'There's more time than life'... and they don't care if they arrive on time or not... as they see the future events as a 'question mark'... because of what I already said, they do not see unpunctuality as an offense and I do.\n\nI hope that answers what you're looking for."

"1","How long does it take to learn Japanese and Korean to the fluent or conversation level?","I also mean the writing systems and all the dialect. I will commit as many years and hours a day as I can, but how long does it usually take for each language? Which language should be learned first, Japanese or Korean?","there is no similarity between korean and japanese, other than the fact that the grammar is very similar.  vocabulary-wise, many words in both languages are based off of chinese characters.  however, japanese uses chinese characters (kanji) and pronounce them by pure japanese words, and koreans simply have pure korean and sino-korean vocabulary mixed together... in essence, almost two words for everything.\ni've studied both korean and japanese, and personally, i found korean to be much more enjoyable.  then again, i'm sure this is only personal preference.\ni studied korean intensively in korea, and it takes a while to attain even a basic level of fluency, due to the fact that the grammar is almost completely backwards from english.  however, in korea, most korean people are very helpful and willing to work with you.  when i went to japan, i noticed that most japanese people either ignore you completely if you talk to them, or rattle off as fast as they can even though they know you won't understand it.\nif you're choosing whether to study in either country, i'd certainly recommend korean."

"1","How can a person be speaking in tongues without using the language center of their brains?","There's been some articles on studies done on persons Born Again and speaking in tongues. The studies show that the individuals aren't experiencing mental breakdowns or personality disorders that may result in hearing voices.\n\nTwo items of interest is that none of the test subjects spoke any known language, which was explained that they were speaking the language of the angels. But, when the Apostles received the Holy Spirit and spoke tongues, it was for a purpose, to spread God's Word to many nations, all with different languages.\n\nThe other item of interest was that the test subjects were not using the language centers of the human brain. You would assume, that regardless of what language they would be speaking, they would be using the language center of the brain, unless they were speaking gibberish.  \n\nI imagine someone has an explanation, but it seems to me that in everything, God uses what is available. Wouldn't he also use that portion of the brain meant for languages?","It seems that they are speaking gibberish, but that they don't know it.  They essentially trick themselves into having this religious experience.  This is not saying that someone CANNOT speak in tongues through the Holy Spirit, but only that if they did, only that the examples we see today do not appear to be actual supernatural experiences.  Every linguist who has studied various individuals speaking in tongues has stated that what is being spoken is not an actual language (not just a known language, but that it isn't language).  There are those also that believe they have the gift of interpreting these tongues.  But, when a recording of someone speaking in a tongue has been brought to several interpreters, the interpretations are not the same.  \n\nPeople can trick themselves into believing they are speaking in tongues, or that they understand these tongues, but when put to the test, these ""miracles"" do not seem to be miraculous at all.  These people are not bad people, just fooled."

"2","Can anyone tell me that what is the total quantity of Uranium on Earth????","","Uranium is a naturally occurring element found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. This is the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth.\n\nIt is considered to be more plentiful than antimony, beryllium, cadmium, gold, mercury, silver, or tungsten and is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. It is found in many minerals including uraninite (also called pitchblende, most common uranium ore), autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from these sources).\n\nUranium is found to some extent in the majority of rocks and sediments making up the Earth's crust, but is never found in concentrated deposits. \n\nThe most common uranium ore is pitchblende, which consists of a mixture of UO2 with U3O8. The largest known source of pitchblende is located in the Leopolville mines, in Congo, Africa. \n\nOther uranium containing minerals are euxenite, carnotite, brannerite and coffinite. The largest deposits of these ores are located in the USA, Canada, Russia and France."

"2","If x is an integer and 2<x<7, how many different triangles are there with sides of 2, 7, and x?","The answer to this question is One. Why is that?","The two smaller sides must always add up to more than the largest side (otherwise you can't make a triangle).  Since the sides must be *integer* sides, the only valid triangle is 2, 6 and 7.\n\nStated another way, here are the combinations:\n2-3-7, impossible triangle (try connecting the 2 and 3 sides together...)\n2-4-7, impossible triangle (try connecting the 2 and 4 sides together...)\n2-5-7, straight line, not a triangle\n2-6-7, valid triangle\n\nSo there is only one combination (2-6-7) that makes a triangle when x is an *integer* greater than 2 and less than 7."
"2","how do motion sensors detect movement?","","It really depends on the motion sensor. There are two types, active and passive. Active sensors include the sensors that open grocery store doors (these send out microwave radio energy then wait for it to bounce back), also alarms that emit beams of light (if the beam is broken the change in light is detected). Active sensors basically send something out into the environment and receive the changes. The motion sensor in most alarm systems are considered passive dectectors because they don't emit anything, but detect changes in energy such as infrared energy. These are usually set to detect small changes in the temperature of the human body. One cool experiment is if you stand behind a window, the motion sensors won't ""see"" you! This is because glass isn't a good conductor of infrared energy. Either way, these devices are interesting inventions!"

"2","What is the difference between an ape and a gorilla?","Are they the same thing or two separate mammals within the same family?","There are two issues here. \nFirst, these terms refer to different logical classes. \nThe classification system that we use is based on inclusive (nested) categories and in that sense, the logical class ""ape"" includes the logical class ""gorilla"".\nBut there's another aspect to this.\nThe term gorilla refers to the animals belonging to one species, Gorilla gorilla (with different subspecies). In this case, the common word has a taxonomic equivalent.\n\nOn the contrary, ""ape"" does not have an exact equivalent in terms of systematic groupings or clades. In a general sense, ""apes"" are understood as Old World monkeys that lack a tail. They would include the families Pongidae (orangutan), Hominidae (chimpanzee, gorilla, man) and Hylobatidae (gibbons). However, for other people, the gibbons are ""lesser apes"" and the Pongidae are ""higher apes"". Many would also exclude man from the apes. Thus, for the authors of ""Planet of the Apes"", only the ""higher apes"" were included in the definition! \nIn consequence, there is no taxonomical equivalent for the common term ""ape"". A similar thing happens with ""monkeys"", that is, other Primates that have a long tail, are generally medium-sized and arboreal (including macaques, baboons, guenons, capuchins, marmosets, etc). This is another term that does not correspond to the systematic arrangement but rather includes several taxons."

The most recent earthquake in Illinois was a 3.6 magnitude quake near Harrisburg and Marion, Illinois, in the southern half of the state. The southern part of the state is within the hazard zone for the New Madrid Fault which is centered near New Madrid in southern Missouri, in the Bootheel. \n\nHere's the map for the Jan 2, 2006 earthquake near Harrisburg:\nhttp://neic.usgs.gov/neis/last_event_states/states_illinois.html\n\nTo give you an idea of what northern Illinois is like in terms of earthquakes, you might want to know that no earthquake over 3.5 magnitude has occurred in Wisconsin in the last 30 years. Likewise Iowa is almost as seismically quiet as Wisconsin.

"2","i want to know the reason for bend test failure?","i need to know what test could be carried out to check the reason for bend test failure , the bend test failure occured on the FL of the weld and i need to know the actual reason by any test","If the failure occured on the weld, then chances are the weld was not of high quality, or the piece was poorly designed.  Take a cross section of the part at the failure point, and look at the mechanism of the fracture.  Compare what you find to pictures of known failures (brittle failure, crack propogation, etc).  This will show you how it failed, then you should be able to determine the reason for the failure, being that you have the loading data.  If the weld was good, but the break still occured here, it could be because of stress concentrations that were induced because of a poorly designed part.  To give you a better answer, I would need more specific information about the broken part, the load applied, and the material involved."

"2","What are limestone caves?Where are they found and how are they formed?","","Limestone caves are formed by erosion.  Rainwater is slightly acidic and this erodes limestone.  Can start off as rock eroding from a small underground aquifer and can become a large underground river.  The rainwater that percolates through the ground and into the caves erodes the calcium in the limestone.  Where it drips off the roof of the cave, some of the calcite is deposited and this eventually forms a stalicitite.  Where it hits the floor of the cave it becomes a stalicmite.  There are examples of Limestone caves open to the public in Co. Clare and Fermanagh in Ireland although there are many more cave systems in theses areas."

"1","how do you do an effective lectio divina?","","THE ART of  lectio divina begins with cultivating the ability to listen deeply, to hear “with the ear of our hearts” as St. Benedict encourages us in the Prologue to the Rule. When we read the Scriptures we should try to imitate the prophet Elijah. We should allow ourselves to become women and men who are able to listen for the still, small voice of God (I Kings 19:12); the “faint murmuring sound” which is God's word for us, God's voice touching our hearts. This gentle listening is an “atunement” to the presence of God in that special part of God's creation which is the Scriptures.\n\nTHE CRY of the prophets to ancient Israel was the joy-filled command to “Listen!” “Sh'ma Israel: Hear, O Israel!” In lectio divina we, too, heed that command and turn to the Scriptures, knowing that we must “hear” - listen - to the voice of God, which often speaks very softly. In order to hear someone speaking softly we must learn to be silent. We must learn to love silence. If we are constantly speaking or if we are surrounded with noise, we cannot hear gentle sounds. The practice of lectio divina, therefore, requires that we first quiet down in order to hear God's word to us. This is the first step of lectio divina, appropriately called lectio - reading.\n\nTHE READING or listening which is the first step in lectio divina is very different from the speed reading which modern Christians apply to newspapers, books and even to the Bible. Lectio is reverential listening; listening both in a spirit of silence and of awe. We are listening for the still, small voice of God that will speak to us personally - not loudly, but intimately. In lectio we read slowly, attentively, gently listening to hear a word or phrase that is God's word for us this day."

"1","Why blame Judas? Why blame the Jews?","In the bible, Jesus gave his life for our sins. He knew in advance that he would be crucified, and according to the text it was Gods will that this be done.\n\nIf this is the case, why do we consider Judas a traitor - was he not carrying out God's will?\n\nWhy do so many blame the Jews for the crucifiction when it was God's intention that his son be sacrificed?","For the first part it is simple ...\nThink about this: we are all God's creation and one way or another we carry on God's will. One of the assets given to us is free-will, the will to do as we choose. God's purpose now is to guide us on the right path, but it is us who must walk it. Judas did not know God's will at the time, it was much later that people were aware of what Jesus' death actually ment.\nThe fact that God intended it doesn't excuse Judas' act. It was Judas' choice to betray his teacher and this alone makes his act evil, just like any treason. God doesn't mind-control anyone. He chose to betray Jesus to the romans, thus he is a traitor and his treachery is ten-fold since we are talking about the Son of God (something Judas really believed or he wouldn't be an Apostle).\nAlso the fact that he's a traitor doesn't mean christians should hold a grudge against Judas.

Any links to websites, or books that describe the procedure would be appreciated.\n\nThanks..","Its a genuine question; I suggest you to post ur question in google answers; u can get researched answers; remeber it is paid service. What I know about is it is produced by recombinant technique which word itself is self explanatory; meaning a complicated genetic process GH like proteins are made with the knowledge of its DNA structure. It has been used successfully in several conditions which can produce short stature. They are genetic short stature, Turners syndrome, Prader willi syndrome, Chronica renal failure. The subjects are shown to be better in height velocity and has achieved a target height height 50 th percentile in a significant number of cases. It is an injection through subcutaneous route; intermittent ie once in few weeks; and requires monitoring of height BP and some blood tests to look for side effects. No significant harm has been reported till now. You can get these details in medical text books like; Harrison's internal medicine; Nelson's text book of paediatrics and various books of endocrinology. For the website you can do a google search with key words Human Growth Hormone, Treatment with growth hormone, adverse effects Human growth hormones etc and select appropriate articles according to ur knowledge level..Look for emedicine article; if u r a medical professional u can look for pubmed article.."

"1","Is science a good part of religion?","How do you feel about the scientific explanation of rainbows, vs the Bibles?  Do they contradict or complement each other?","When the Bible says that God created the rainbow you need to remember that up until the flood, no one ever saw a rainbow because it never rained on the earth until afterward. (The earth was watered by underground springs) God knew that rain was going to cause a refraction of the sunlight, so He ""established"" it as a reminder that He would never again destroy the earth by flood. It may be that at that time, God created the refraction process at the time of the flood. We have never seen or met God. It may just be that when God creates something, the scientific physics are created as well."

"2","On satellites and Newton's law?","How does say the Hubble telescope aim itself?\n\nEvery action creates an opposite reaction blah blah.  I would think that simply using an internal motor to swivel the camera would be fruitless.  \n\nI cannot imagine that thing having sufficient rocket propellant for it to operate for years between services.","The Hubble Telescope uses internal gyros to adjust the direction that it is facing.  The camera and the lens adjust the field of view and the distance of the focus.\n\nThe gyros inside the Hubble Telescope are spinning at a high rate of speed, they are kept spinning by motors, thus creating a lot of angular momentum.  We can't convert angular momentum into horizontal momentum (spindizzy space drive), but we can transfer that momentum to create angular momentum into something else.\n\nBy Newton’s laws of motion a quickly spinning small object can transmit its energy to slowly move a big object.  Once the gyroscopes do that they need to be spun up again.  The gyros stores the energy generated by the electric motors as rotational energy.  With a gyroscope in a vacuum, spinning on a diamond point then it will keep it's energy for a long time; it is rotating in a very low friction environment.  When the motors are put into contact with the gyros, but locked so they can't spin the spinning energy is then transmitted to the rest of the Space Telescope.\n\nWhen the operators, at the Jet Propulsion Center, want to rotate the Hubble Telescope they spin up the gyros with electric motors, then transfer that to the telescope itself.  The movment is very small, which is what the astronomers want.  If they want to make a big turn, then need to use the gyros several times.  Hubble has three gyroscopes on the up-down axis, and three gyroscopes on the port-starboard axis (NASA likes triple redundancy).  Four of those gyroscopes are not working anymore.\n\nAn internal motor can swing a small telescope, as long as it is mounted on a large object.  In this case the momentum generated by swinging the small telescope is transferred to the large object where it will have less effect, it may not even have enough effect to over power the objects inertia and so the large object remains in place.  This is the opposite of what happens in the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nYou are correct that it would be futile to try and spin a large object with a small motor more energy is required.  According to Newton’s Laws objects at rest tend to stay at rest, so you have to overcome inertia to get an object moving.  A motor doesn’t have enough energy to do that.  It takes a gyroscope with more energy imparted to it to overcome the inertia.  If the Hubble Telescope used motors to turn itself then these motors would just turn slowly until they burned out.  The movement that they would impart would be very small.  A gyroscope is repeatedly spun up to faster and faster speeds.  Its large energy is stored, ready to transmit it to the telescope.\n\nThe rockets on the Hubble are only used for position keeping and gross movement.  Their fuel is limited so they can't do this often.  The gyros are powered by electric motors using the power generated, by the sun, inside the solar cells.  To keep this power flow even, and to insure that there is enough power to operate things like the gyroscopes batteries are used.\n\nWhen an astronaut uses an electric screwdriver in space the small motor creates a high angular momentum.  The station is too large (has too much inertia) to be turned with the screwdriver so it spins the astronaut.  Special gearing and balancing, inside the screwdriver, is needed to prevent this.  If the astronaut tries to spin the screwdriver by hand then they are doing the same thing.  The resistance to the screw caused by the hull of the space station is strong enough to send the rotational energy right back into the astronaut.  The astronaut doesn’t have the ability to brace against the earth and use its inertia to stop them from rotating.  If the astronaut is in a braced position then they can use the inertia of the Space Station to prevent them from rotating, but this isn’t always a good position to work from.  The Hubble has a lot less mass and the gyros are positioned to work on one axis so it uses the energy more efficiently.  Movin"

"1","Is there really God?If is how many?If one God,how come there is a lot of different religion in the world?","I've been wondering this question since I little.I ask my parents but they couldn't answer that question too,they only answered,believe in what you believe now.And my catholic teacher told me that,there is really God,if not how the world and human be created?What is your opinion about the question above?","Do you really think anyone on Yahoo Answers has the answer to what many philosphers have been trying to figure out for thousands of years? Ehh... I'll try.\n\nI have spent countless nights trying to get some sort of answer myself. It's really hard for me accept that there is a God though. Either that, or it's hard for me to accept the God that my parents tried to drill into to my head since I was a baby. (They are fundamentalist Christians by the way. the outrageous ideas make me sad that there are more people out there like them.)\n\nI think there might a God because it seems very unlikely that such a complex life could have happened by accident, or by an explosion of matter. The way that DNA is constructed, cells, and just the way that the human body functions seems all too perfect for it to happen by some random chance. \n\nHowever, I as I said before, I don't know if I could ever believe in the Catholic or Christian God. Supposedly, God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. That means he is all-good, all-knowing, and all-powerful. I'm sure that you are well aware of the sorrow, suffering and pain that a billion people feel every day due to war,starvation, genocide, poverty, and most importantly evil. If God was all-good, he would not allow this to happen. If God is all-good, but he can't stop it, that means he is not all-powerful. If said God is not all-powerul, then he cannot be God. \n\nGod cannot be omnicent or all-knowing, because humans have free will, and those two are contridictory. One might argue that everything needs a creator. Even the Universe. Something cannot create itself. So God created the universe, but who or what created God? \n\nPerhaps there is a God, but it is likely that all of those rules, and dogmatic views that Christians teach is not accurate. The texts of the Bible have been PROVEN to be altered by numerous kings, who put into it what they wanted. Similar to how George W. Bush is running the country based on his morals. I don't know, you decide.\n\n The answer will probably never be solved, and people will always be kept wondering. I believe in God, but I don't believe in organized religion.\n\nRead this, you would find it interesting. It's a converstaion between an ordinary man and God. Good read.\nhttp://www.fullmoon.nu/articles/art.php?id=tal"

When taking pictures in low ambient light scenarios using a flash the result many times is redness in the people’s eyes.\n\nThe reason for the color red is simple – when flash light from the camera hits the eyes it penetrates and is reflected back from the retina. The color of the reflected light is red because the light is actually reflected from the red blood in the retina.\n\n(To read more, click the link below.)"

You should ask Mr. Bush, Mr. Blair, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (for those that don't know he's Supreme Leader of Iran which is both religious leader and military commander in chief - a dangerous combination!) and Hú Jǐntāo (President of the People's Republic of China who threatened Mr. Bush with nuclear war if Bush tried to stop China's progress towards annexing Taiwan, or attacked North Korea). As an Economics grad I know if none of these characters spark a nuclear confrontation we should survive the next 10 years. \n\nYou are also right to say that every beginning has an end. As a science grad I believe that the world will end eventually but not in our life time as our Sun, source of most life processes will die. In 4–5 billion years, it will enter a red giant phase, its outer layers expanding as the hydrogen fuel in the core is consumed and the core contracts and heats up. Helium fusion will begin when the core temperature reaches about 3×108 K. While it is likely that the expansion of the outer layers of the Sun will reach the current position of Earth's orbit. Recent research suggests that mass lost from the Sun earlier in its red giant phase will cause the Earth's orbit to move further out, preventing it from being engulfed. Following the red giant phase, intense thermal pulsations will cause the Sun to throw off its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula. The Sun will then evolve into a white dwarf, slowly cooling over eons. At this stage the solar luminosity will be insufficient to support life on Earth."

If there is a top margin of 3 in. and a lower margin of  in., what will the total height of the sign be?\n\nThanks in advance!","I used to also. I'll try to give an explanation: forgive me if I go over anything you already know. Alright, think of it this way: you know how to multiply fractions, correct? Alright, so when you multiply two fractions, such as 1/2 and 3/4, you multiply the numerators (those are on the top) (1x3) and the denominators (those are on the bottom) (2x4) and you have your answer: 1/2 x 3/4 = (1x3)/(2x4) = 3/8. Dividing is just the opposite of multiplication. So if you were dividing 1/2 by 3/4, you just flip over the second fraction and multiply: 1/2 / 3/4 = 1/2 x 4/3 = 4/6. \nHere's an answer that's a bit more advanced but might help you understand this better (at least it did for me): if you have some number, a, over some number, b, it can be written this way: a/b. Now, if you divide it by some other fraction, c/d, it can be written this way: \na/b x 1/(c/d). This is the same as saying that when you divide 6/1 by, say, 2 (which equals the fraction 2/1), it is the same as if you are multiplying 6/1 (6/1, or six divided by 1, equals 6) by 1/2. See for yourself: 6 / 2=3, 6 x 1/2= 6/1 x 1/2 = 6/2 which when you reduce (divide top and bottom by common factor, in this case 2) it equals 3/1, or 3. \n1/(c/d) is the reciprocal of (c/d). The reciprocal basically means you flip the top and bottom: for instance, the reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2, the reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1, or 2, the reciprocal of 4/1, or 4, is 1/4, etc. So if you flip over c/d, you get: a/b x d/c, which if a=1, b=2, c=3, and d=4, is exactly the same as what we had above."

"2","what happens when fuel is burned?","","You didn't specify the fuel but in general burning is a chemical reaction with oxygen or an oxidation process.  This process releases energy in some form.  Heat is one of those forms, mechanical motion, and light are others.\n\nThere is no requirement for carbon in the process of burning fuel as is stated by some other answerer's.  Let's, for example, consider burning hydrogen.  The hydrogen combines with the oxygen (oxidizes) which releases energy in the form of heat.  The Hindenburg disaster had very little carbon in its primary burn.\n\nSince this combining of 2 or more elements seems to be a requirement for burning (at least one of them being oxygen) it is possible to un-combine them by adding energy to revert to the initial elements.  Again for simplicity, let's use hydrogen and oxygen [so abundant on this planet].  When the hydrogen and oxygen are burned in proper balanced proportions (two atoms of hydrogen to one oxygen in stoichiometric proportions) there is only water and energy.  The energy we use to move things, light things, heat things, etc.  The water in this case is waste.  You can perform electrolysis on the water and separate the O2 and H2. You can then burn them again releasing the energy that you put back into the separation through electrolysis.  This is just un-burning the hydrogen and oxygen by adding energy.\n\nTypically one thinks of burning as a non-reversable process but only when you're talking about proteins...like un-frying an egg.  \n\nA string of hydrocarbons burned with ""air"" is also more complicated because we're using a large percentage of nitrogen along with our oxygen.  The ratio is roughly 80/20 Nitrogen to Oxygen. To maintain the balance of equations (that stoichiometric word) we'd be working with nitrogen oxides (burned nitrogen) like nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide and many carbon by-products like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.\n\nAll in all it's a big mess.\n\nI hope that fully answered your question."
"1","Why are we more interested in other peoples lives rather than our own?","","I don't think it's that we are more interested in others' lives than our own.

Do you think gay men sit around thinking, ""Gee, I'll go pack some fudge just to piss off my preacher?"" The medical and psychiatric communities have already figured out that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. It is not a condition, disease, or ailment and therefore cannot be cured, treated, vilified. These so called ex-gay religious groups fooling themselves. A person can choose who or what gender they engage in sex with, but they cannot choose who they are attracted to.

"1","Nicolatians believe.....?","In the bible.","The doctrine of the Nicolaitans was mentioned in the Apocalypse of John to the churches of Pergamos and Ephesus of the seven churches of Asia in Revelation 2. It was a symbolic name of a party that represents the hierarchy of a ruling class over the rest of the people, developing a ""pecking order"" of fleshly leadership. Jesus hated this and warns the people to repent or else ""I will come upon you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth."" The same warning illustration is applied to those that abused grace, which led to licentiousness from the example of Balaam, seducing Christians to fornication and tampering with idolatry. The individual overcomer is allowed to eat of the hidden manna and given a white stone with a new name written in it.\nThe Early church father Iranaeus, identified the Nicolaitans in his treatise ""Against Heresies"" in the second century as they who are an ""offshoot of the knowledge which is falsely so-called,"" mentioning that they ""lead lives of unrestrained indulgence."" There is no absolute proof that the heretic Nicolas was the Deacon of the same name from Antioch of the seven deacons in the book of Acts, but Iranaeus supposed him to be so. Ignatius mentions the Nicolaitans also, so there was in fact a heretical group existing at that time. Nicolas the deacon was perhaps confused with another Nicolas, the bishop Nicolas of Samaria who was a heretic in the company of Simon Magus.\n\nThe root of the word Nicolaitans comes from Greek nikao, to conquer or overcome, and laos, which means people and which the word laity comes from. The two words together especially means the destruction of the people and refers to the earliest form of what we call a priestly order or clergy which later on in church history divided people and allowed for leadership other than those led by the spirit of the risen Lord Jesus Christ. A good translation of Nicolaitan would be ""those who prevail over the people."" This clerical system later developed into the papal hierarchy of priests and clergy lording over the flock. The Council of Trent stated, ""If anyone shall say that there is not in the Catholic Church a hierarchy established by the divine ordination, consisting of bishops, presbyters and ministers, let him be anathema."" It is not the question of the ministries but rather in the separation of them into a hierarchy over the people. This very idea was taken over by the Protestants with their own corruption of leadership roles and coverings. The Church of Ephesus was commended for hating the deeds of the Nicolaitans. The wrong separation of the clergy from the laity is a great evil in God's sight and He hates the lust for religious power. There is an ungodly spiritual authority in the Church today, which is nothing more than the prideful spirit of control, manipulation, domination and intimidation and a rebellion of the rightful authority of God.\n\nFaithful believers who have put on Christ Jesus, are all God's laity. Peter exhorted us to \n\nFeed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind. Neither as being lords over God's heritage but being examples to the flock. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.\nShepherds serve the sheep but the wolves that clothe themselves with so-called leadership and spiritual authority serve themselves, thinking that they serve God. In essence, this makes them false christs. Early church leaders were established as overseers, not a ruling hierarchy."

"2","Can you explain …whats acceleration due to gravity in simple terms with examples….I did not understand reading","","We will consider motion along a straight line as it is simple. As observed by us we can divide the motion into two categories. Motion with same speed and motion with changing speed. Speed changing is acceleration (this is what happens when the accelerator of a car is pressed). Acceleration is measured by how much speed changes in one second. Acceleration of a body is due to force applied on the body(higher the force higher is the acceleration).  When a body is falling its speed is changing at the rate of about ten metres per second per second. ie in every second the speed changes by 10m/s. If a body is dropped its initial speed is zero. After one second its speed will be 10m/s and after another second its speed will be 20m/s and so on. And this speed changing rate (acceleration) is constant for all bodies(big, small, hot ,cold etc). This speed changing (acceleration) is there because of the force due to earth which pulls everybody towards its centre. The exact value is 9.8m/s/s(varies slightly from place to place).  This speed changing rate or acceleration caused due to earth's pull is acceleration due to gravity. Acceleration due to gravity on the moon is less and acceleration due to gravity on Jupiter is more than that on earth."

Thanks.","Choose x to stand for the amount invested at 10%.  The remaining amount would be 15,000 - x.

"2","Why do atoms join or react?","","The answer is simple. All elements (whose basic units are atoms) except the noble gases, have less than 8 electrons in their valence shells.  The rule that states that atoms should have 8 electrons to achieve stability is called The Octet Rule.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_rule\n\nThe way that they can attain 8 electrons is by forming BONDS: by either sharing electrons (covalent bond) or by gaining/losing electrons (ionic bond).   This is the main reason why atoms react: to attain 8 valence electrons.\n\nIf we look at it at another angle, we can say that atoms react in order to decrease energy.  This comes from the principle that bond formation results in loss of energy, and that stability comes from decreased energy.\n\nHope that helps."

Easter isn't about easter baskets and bunny rabbits that hop giving eggs and treats to kids and so forth. So when did the easter bunny become the spokes person for Easter instead of the real reason why we celebrate it... Jesus Christ?","EASTER A BRIEF HISTORY\n\nThe name “Easter” comes to America from Ostera or Eostre, the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring. The origin goes back to 2000 BC in Babylonia honoring the goddess of spring Ishtar. Ishtar the mother/wife of their god Tammuz brought him back from the underworld. In Phoenecia she became Astarte, in Greece Eostre, and in Germany Ostara. Consider also a Phrygian honoring Attis and Cybele or a heretic Israelite honoring the Canaanite Baal and Ashtoreth. All of these are fertility celebrations of death and resurrection.\n\nEASTER IN THE KING JAMES\n\nThe word “Easter” occurs in the King James Bible ONE TIME and is mistranslated. It should be translated PASSOVER.\n\nActs 12:4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. \n\nEaster G3957 pascha (pas'-khah) Of Chaldee origin (compare [H6453]); the Passover (the meal, the day, the festival or the special sacrifices connected with it): - Easter, Passover.\n\nH6453  pesach (peh'-sakh) From H6452; a pretermission, that is, exemption; used only technically of the Jewish Passover (the festival or the victim): - passover (offering).\n\nH6452 pasach (paw-sakh') A primitive root; to hop, that is, (figuratively) skip over (or spare); by implication to hesitate; also (literally) to limp, to dance: - halt, become lame, leap, pass over.\n\nTHE ORIGINAL PASSOVER A SHADOW\n\nExo.12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. Exo.12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. Exo.12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as He hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. Exo.12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? Exo.12:27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. \n\nWhat did it say in Exo.12:26? What mean ye by this service?\n\nWhat did it say in Exo.12:27? It is the SACRIFICE of the LORD'S Passover.\n\nThis was a shadow, that is a silhouette or likeness, of Christ’s crucifixion. Israel was in bondage to the Egyptians. We were in bondage to sin.\n\nCHRIST OUR PASSOVER\n\nI Cor.5:6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? I Cor.5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us: I Cor.5:8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. \n\nChrist our Passover is SACRIFICED for us.\n\nIT IS PROBABLY TRULY DISGUSTING TO FATHER \n\nAs with most Christian holidays, Easter has been secularized and commercialized. We have Easter bunnies, eggs, baskets, bonnets, parades and etc. \n\nKnowing now the origins of Easter, the fallacy of Easter and the sacrifice Christ made for us; I am truly ashamed of myself. We should not be celebrating Easter. We should be celebrating Christ our Passover with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. \n\nWhat is your answer to a child who asks, “What mean ye by this service?” I pray your answer is not Easter.\n\nWhat does God think, about what He sees and hears during this special time of year?"

"2","Which method, gravimetric analysis or volumetric analysis is more reliable and why?","I am looking at these methods used to determine metal content in a solution.","The previous responder brings up excellent points, particularly about the method relying on how good the analyst is.  This is highly true!   However I would add, that gravimetric methods are typically more ACCURATE for the following reasons:\n\n1.  Errors associated with volume measurement (loss in transfer, parallax, spillage, over-titration, etc.) are reduced in gravimetric measurements.  In most gravimetric measurements, you WEIGH a final product, which either IS the compound of interest, or is stoichiometrically related to it.\n\n2.  Gravimetric methods are less sensitive to temperature than volumetric methods.\n\n3.  While BOTH types of methods are subject to sample loss, gravimetic methods are less so.  (Note:  This is less true if the analyst is a clutz.   Goes very well with the previous poster's comment!)\n\n4.  A mass is easier to reproducibly determine than a concentration.   (Any day of the week!)\n\n5.  A mass is easier to STANDARDIZE than a concentration.  Again there are errors associated with both, we concede, but mass is generally easier to deal with.  \n\n6.  You will more likely encounter limits (of sensitivity) in volume measurements than you will in  mass measurements, depending on how your lab is equipped.  \n\nThese are a few thoughts, I'm sure there are others."

"2","explain how acids & bases act as buffers?","","Acidity is when an excess of H+ binds H2O as H3O+.  Strong acids are ones like HCl, which in solution will ionize completely--Cl-, being very soluble, will let go of H+ to make the solution acidic.  Other ""weak"" bases are ones that do not necessarily ionize completely.  Excess H+ will bind to sites in the weak acid molecule rather than binding to H20, meaning that the pH will not be as low (low pH < 7 = acidic).  In this way, a weak acid can act as a buffer--in pure water, it will ionize to a certain extent, but with excess H+, it will bind more H+, but the free H+ in solution will only change very little, and the pH remains rather stable."

"2","Zoloft Overdosing?","Does anyone know about overdosing on Zoloft?","Among 634 overdoses in which sertraline hydrochloride was the only drug ingested, 8 resulted in fatal outcome, 75 completely recovered, and 27 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage to include alopecia, decreased libido, diarrhea, ejaculation disorder, fatigue, insomnia, somnolence and serotonin syndrome. The remaining 524 cases had an unknown outcome. The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal sertraline hydrochloride overdosage were somnolence, vomiting, tachycardia, nausea, dizziness, agitation and tremor. \n\nThe largest known ingestion was 13.5 grams in a patient who took sertraline hydrochloride alone and subsequently recovered. However, another patient who took 2.5 grams of sertraline hydrochloride alone experienced a fatal outcome. \n\nOther important adverse events reported with sertraline hydrochloride overdose (single or multiple drugs) include bradycardia, bundle branch block, coma, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations, hypertension, hypotension, manic reaction, pancreatitis, QT-interval prolongation, serotonin syndrome, stupor and syncope. \n\nOverdose Management -Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant. \n\nEnsure an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. \n\nActivated charcoal should be administered. Due to large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for sertraline are known. \n\nIn managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement.

"2","what is H2SO4?","","Sulpuric Acid. If you have heard of 'Acid Rain', this comes down on us around fossil fuel burning plants, which give off SO2 or Suphur Dioxide. When SO2 mixes with the rain water coming down on us, it creates H2SO4 in a diluted form. \n\nH2O + SO2 = H2SO4.\n\nNot harmful to us, but very damaging to buildings. That's why when you see old churches etc the carvings are often worn away.\n\nIn its pure form it is very dangerous and needs transporing by a police escort in a glass tank as it reacts with all other things.\n\nHope this helps."

How can you evaluate these claims from a scientific perspective?","First of all, the ""normal"" universe is entriely made of chemical elements and their compounds.  Next, when you look at the claims that some manufactures say, stating ""no chemicals 100% natural"" what they probably mean is no man-made chemical compounds.  Lastly, this claim is implys that natural chemical compounds are safe and human friendly -- this is completely nuts.  Some of the most toxic substances known are ""natural.""

"1","Christians, question about why God wouldn't reveal Himself...?","Please read all and come up with a relevant, decent answer.\n\nSome Christians have stated on here that if God did try and prove Himself to us that many would think its just an illusion or something, but not me. I would be convinced if God, with all his infinite power, proved His existence. So why wouldn't He just reveal Himself to people seeking Him? \n\nYou can't really have a relationship with the unproven.\nI keep hearing analogies like if your spouse went away for a week, but you still trust them. Well duh! You already know they exist! Christians, are there any better analogies?","Why doesn't he stand on the side of the road like a billboard?  He does, all of creation testifies to His existance. Study something as simple as a leaf- it's astounding the detail that goes into it.  You seem to like analogies- I do too- so look at it this way: if you see a beautiful Monet, you can admire the brushstrokes, the colors and the composition and no one has to try and convince you that there was an artist!  ""No, no,"" you might say, ""I believe that thousands of years ago all those colors were just thrown into the air and they happened to land on the canvas in this fashion.""  The creation (the painting) testifies to the existance of a painter (the creator)\n\nMatthew 7:7 says if you seek Him you will find Him.  A friend of mine grew up in an orphanage in India and as a small child, wanted to know if there was more to God.  Jesus appeared to Him in a vision and told Him who He was.  Then he began praying for a bible and miraculously enough, some missionaries (this was back in the 1950's- people didn't travel as much as they do today) happened to pass through their small villiage and visit the orphanage so he could have a bible.  He's a missionary now, going to my church and traveling back and forth to India.  \n\nWe have a relationship with God through the Holy Spirit.  It is the Holy Spirit that works on this earth.  I've seen people's deaf ears open. I took a drug dealer to church once, and the power of God there made him start to convulse on the floor- THE NEXT DAY 1.He called all his contacts, 2.quit selling and using drugs and 3. started a street evangelism ministry for the homeless in Houston.  I know God exists because He works in my life- the Holy Spirit can give me a check in my spirit and keep me from going places, and can teach me through revelation. \n\nI have personally prayed for people and God has shown me specific situations in their lives to talk to them about.  One woman I met in a Burger King (she was an employee there) God put it on my heart to pray for her.  As I began to pray I said, ""God let her be a light to Chris."" and she stopped me, took about 3 steps back and wide-eyed asked, ""how did you know my husband's name was Chris?""  Well, I didn't.  I had never met her before; I just prayed what God wanted me to- and He wanted to show her that He knew her, He saw her, He knew her situation and that He cared.  It was pretty cool!\n\n Just yesterday I was reading Psalm 2 about how God fights our battles for us, and I asked Him to do that for me.  Well last night we went to dinner at this restaurant, the food was awful, we were over charged for our meals, but it was such an exhausting day that I didn't feel like fighting our waiter. We still tipped him (since i was a waitress for years) Well the guy comes back with our check copy AND a bag of pasta (the pasta was the large size we'd been charged for, but had not recieved) saying ""the kitchen accidentally made this- you guys want it?""  fresh bread (he hadn't been refilling our bread basket as he should have) and our leftovers.  And my friend, without knowing about my conversation with God that morning said, ""Man, we didn't even have to fight him (the waiter)"" \n\n I know this is an insignificant story, I could tell you more miraculous ones, like how I was woken in the middle of the night to pray for my sister who was busy totaling her car (but walked away with only a small scratch on her knee after clearing a 5' tall fence!) how I was healed of a degenerative family disease, how the power of God has touched my home, but it is the daily testimonies, the small things, that grow our faith. He just wanted me to know yesterday (because of all the battles I'm going through right now) that He cares even for the smallest skirmishes. E-mail me if you want to know more.  I could tell you story after story of the miraculous things God has done.  "

When you write ""17"" that is using two symbols to represent a number.  You could also write ""XVII"" as another set of symbols to express the same number.  Or ""10+7"", or ""(2*9)-1"".  All symbols.\n\nWhen you start using letters as symbolic *placeholders* for numbers, then you've moved up beyond 6th-grade arithmetic and can start using math for more interesting things."
"1","Imagine that you were not going to go to Heaven because you committed the unpardonable sin?","Would you still try your best to give glory to God and be thankful to Him for the life you have now?  I wonder how many so called Christians would turn their back on Him if they knew they were not going to Heaven.  Shouldn't we look at what we can do to give glory to God rather than just expecting God to do for us?","Jesus mentions a sin that is unforgivable in Matt. 12:31-32 and calls it blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.\n\nNo. A believer cannot commit the unforgivable sin. How can someone who has been born again (John 3:7), made a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17), and received eternal life (John 10:27-28) actually commit the unforgivable sin? He cannot. Jesus Himself said that we have eternal life, not conditional life: ""My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give eternal life to them, and they shall never perish; and no one shall snatch them out of My hand."" Besides, it says in 2 Cor. 5:17 that the Christian is a new creation in Christ. We are different, no longer slaves to the old nature (Rom. 6:14). We are regenerated by the Holy Spirit.\n     There is no biblical support for a believer committing this sin. It just hasn’t happened. Also, if you are worried that you may have committed the sin and can’t be forgiven, then don’t be concerned. If you are worrying about it, then you haven’t committed it. If you are worried about it, then that is a sign that you have not committed it. If you had, you wouldn’t be concerned."

This is reflected in the following verse\n""Now no person knows what delights of the eye are kept hidden (in reserve) for them - as a reward for their (good) deeds."" Quran 32:17.\n\nSince there is no means to describe heaven, God uses similtitude of things that people likes in this world to describe heaven.\n""A similitude of the Garden which is promised unto those who keep their duty (to Allah): Underneath it rivers flow; its food is everlasting, and its shade; "" Quran 13: 35. \n\nIn earth, sex has got a specific purpose other than enjoyment, that is procreation.

"2","What is the unsolvable equation?","","Usually, when people talk about solvable equations, they are talking about taking a polynomial and setting it to zero & then finding all of the roots of the equation.\n\nA linear equation (ax+b = 0) is easy to solve.\n\nA quadratic equation (ax^2+bx+c = 0) is not so hard.  You probably learned the quadratic equation in high school.  That formula has been around since the ancient Greeks.\n\nWhat about cubic equations?  (ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = 0)  It turns out that there is a formula that you can use to find the three roots of the equation.  It was discovered in the 1300s by Tartaglia.  It is a very complicated formula.\n\nThe obvious next choice is to see if we can solve fourth degree equations using a formula.  Legendre discovered the formula for this in the late 18th century.\n\nThen a few interesting things happened.  Gauss had already proven that every polynomial with integral coefficients has a solution in the complex numbers.  But in the early 1800s, Nicholas Abel proved that there is no general formula for solving equations of degree five or higher.  Sure -- we know that some can be solved (x^5-32=0 has five roots that can be found, including 2).  But there is no general formula.\n\nA few years later, a young Frenchman named Evariste Galois created a beautiful system that allows us to take any polynomial and through a series of steps tells us exactly which polynomial equations can be solved and which ones cannot be solved.  It took another 50 years for people to find out about his work, because he was killed in a duel before he turned 21.\n\nSo -- if you want to know if an equation is unsolvable, just use Galois' method."

"2","Why do automobile wheels look as if the wheels are going backwards when a car is moving forwards?","","For most people, they only look that way under certain conditions: in a movie or video recording, or at night under certain types of lights.\n   This effect is called aliasing, where one does not observe a continuous picture, but lots of snapshots at regular instances of time.  In movies or video, this occurs at the frame rate of the camera.  Under certain lights like Sodium lamps (and incandescents to a lesser degree), their brightness varies with the 50 or 60 HZ frequency of the AC power supplied to them.  This has the effect of also time-sampling the scene, to some degree, just like a strobe light freezes a moving scene. \n    Consider, for example, if the wheel has a regular pattern of spokes, and it is captured in a 30 frame per second movie.  If the speed of the wheel is just right so that the wheel rotates 1 spoke distance in the 1/30th of a second interval between frames, then in each frame the wheel will look the same.  Thus, in the movie, the wheel will appear to be still.  If the wheel speeds up just slightly from this rate, the spokes will appear in each frame just slightly ahead of the last (although you are really looking at a different spoke in each frame), and the wheel will appear to turn forward very slowly.  If the wheel slows down from this rate, the wheel will appear to turn backwards very slowly.\n   This effect is generally not observed in direct sunlight, but the wheel will appear as a continuous blur.  However, because it is a blur, the eye is quite sensititve to even very faint aliasing effects which allow the brain to perceive some stucture there.  Such faint aliasing can come from a variety of unexpected sources, such as the slight increase/decreases in ambient light level as a car drives beside a guardrail with a regular spacing of posts.  Near each post, the light will be slightly brighter or darker from the reflections or shadows of light off the post.  This will give a regular time varying brightness in the car's frame of reference, which may cause a faint aliasing pattern to become visible."
"1","Q about davinci code again....?","what is wrong with the idea that jesus christ was married? is it a sin? does it change him from being jesus christ","No, wouldn't change anything regarding His divinity.  The problem would be in the christians who couldn't accept the fact that He could have been a real man, which He was.  Not a normal man of course, but He was a man in ancient Israel at a time when it would have been extraordinary for any man of His age to have not been married and had kids.  The same principal as the one where Mary was suppose to have been a virgin all her life.  Wouldn't have made sense, especially since He had brothers and sisters, but for some reason, people want to believe that Joseph didn't get the marriage annuled if she'd never sleep with him.  Just kinda silly.\n\nJesus was divine, He rose from the dead and assended into heaven, and the concept that He could have been married and had kids would have nothing to do with that divinity.  I personally don't believe He did marry or have kids, but the idea that He may have would not destroy my faith.  I think a lot of christian's faith relies on what they were taught and they simply can't accept the idea."

Maybe we passed and got free reign of our own destiny? Why did man have to leave Eden**** after eating the forbidden fruit, because we purposefully disobeyed God? Was leaving Eden the result of receiving reason? Did we know that that was the punishment? Did God make us aware of the complications of eating the forbidden fruit, or were we too ignorant to understand such a complicated concept? Did we do an “Awwww, Damn!” When we realized what we did, did Adam slap Eve. B-itch! Was the forbidden fruit, sex? Did Adam knock up Eve and gained reason when she missed a month. No wait.

"1","Why can't God be a woman?","If God the creator is a man, wouldn't it follow that men should be the ones creating life by giving birth? \n\nAccording to some, we were created in God's image, if I'm not mistaken.","I wrote a paper about language used for God while I was in college, I'll just paste parts of it in here where it fits in between my thoughts now.\n\nGod being referred to as a man is a perfect example of the overuse of a metaphor. the metaphor is supposed to bring out certain feelings and allow the reader to relate better to the subject at hand. the overuse of a metaphor obviously proves to have problems, when in this case, referring to God as a woman somehow tends to turn heads.\n\nit seems everyone is hitting it with saying that God is neither male nor female. biblically, there are referrences to giving God both male and female characteristics, as well as comparisons to animals and inanimate objects. God is all things. whoever quoted the I Am scripture got it right.\n\nmale references:\n\n""Along with God as a father, there are other male images for God in the Bible. God is referred to as a shepherd in Psalm 23 and Ezekiel 34 (103). God is referred to as “. . . LORD Most High, the great King over all the earth” in Psalm 47:2 and a judge and king in Psalm 96:10 (103-104). God is portrayed to have great strength and courage. In Psalm 24:8, God is referenced as being a warrior. It says, “Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.”""\n\nfemale references:\n\n""God is also referred to in feminine aspects. In Isaiah 49:15, God is given the characteristics of a nursing mother. Isaiah 66:13, states that “As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem” (104). God is given the characteristics of a midwife in Psalm 22:9-10 and gives birth in Deuteronomy 32:18 and Isaiah 42:14. Characteristics of women by giving birth can also be found in John 3, when God gave his “only begotten son.”""\n\nanimal references:\n\n""God is also equated with animals throughout the Old and New Testaments. In Matthew 23, as well as Luke 13, God is spoken of as a mother hen gathering her chicks under her wings. In Deuteronomy 32 God is referenced to be a mother eagle, and then again a few animal references are made in Hosea 13:7-8. It states, “So I will come upon them like a lion, like a leopard I will lurk by the path. Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them and rip them open. Like a lion I will devour them; a wild animal will tear them apart” (98).""\n\ninanimate object references:\n\n""Throughout the Bible God is also referenced as inanimate objects. In Deuteronomy 4:24, God is “a consuming fire” and in Psalm 84 God is “a sun and shield” (98). In Deuteronomy 32, God is a rock. However, “‘Rock’ applied to God implies a set of qualities, particularly ones that focus on stability and reliability, that rose in the consciousness of the believing community at a particular time” (102).""\n\nit is also important to note that God's name, which is ""’ehyeh ‘asher ‘ehyeh,"" or roughly YHWH is found over 6,000 times in the old testament. it is roughly and most often translated as ""I am (who I am),"" and is a form of ""to be."" due to the fact that jews regarded God's name as sacred and should never have been spoken, they often substituted YHWH with ""Adonai"" (which is ""kyrios"" in greek and ""dominus"" in latin). all of those forms are masculine and translate as ""lord."" lord obviously has masculine, dominant conotations. since all these forms are masculine, the masculine idea of God was pushed over God's name. God is often also referred to as ""elohim"" which has no gender. the shortened, ""eloh,"" however is feminine and means goddess, so the addition of ""im"" at the end could make the translation of the word merely mean, “god,” “gods,” “goddess,” or “diety.”\n\nwhoever stated that the term for spirit was ruah and was feminine was also correct. it is important to note that the spiri"
"2","Why aren't there enough people in this world who can teach physics the easy way?","everybody is an asshole.","It's a good question, and I'm not really sure of the answer.  It may have something do do with the fact that some people are talented and motivated to be teachers, some are talented and motivated to be physicists, and there's no apparent reason to suspect a broad overlap of the two.  I've had several physics professors who are obviously physicists first, and teachers just because its part of their job description.  \n    \nOn the other hand, what is the 'easy way' to learn physics?  If you  want an overall aesthetic appreciation of the subject, listening to or watching some of the Feynman Lectures will do the trick (I recommend this, you may be able to find them for free online).  But if you want to be able to DO physics, you HAVE to learn the math involved; physics is inextricably linked to mathematics.  \n\nOne problem I see is that teachers do not provide enough opportunities for student feedback.  Most physics curricula are rigid, and alot of teachers (unfortunately) just try to push through the course, without stopping to check if everyone is on board.  And oftentimes it seems like they just don't care.  Everyone learns subjects differently, and physics is no exception.  Teachers ought to respect this in and out of the classroom.\n\nA guy named Paul Hewitt wrote a textbook and made some lecture videos called 'Conceptual Physics' that profess to be an alternative to the standard rigorous mathematics of college physics classes.  I've seen some of the videos.  They're good...but they're still physics lectures. \n\nPractical advice:  Work problem sets out with a friend, or see a tutor.  A different perspective helps fill in alot of the gaps.  \nAlso, post questions in yahoo! answers and other forums.  An army of sad losers is waiting to help."

I was sitting in bryant park on my lunch break today watching them and wondering; why?","Although the ""balance"" hypothesis sounds logical, experiments have determined that the head-bob of pigeons is rather related to vision.\n\nI'll quote myself (from the answer at the bottom link):\nHead bobbing has been hypothesized to be related to vision.\nWhen a bird's head is still, the images can form on the retina without the blur of motion. \nNow you're thinking: but the head is not still, it's bobbing! \nHowever, this is a visual effect, and in reality the head is keeping immobile, while the body moves. Head bobbing increases the stillness of the head during walking, running and landing. \nHead bobbing is not caused by an anatomical link of feet to neck or something like that; instead, it's synchronized with the movements of the feet, and although this could and has suggested a biomechanical function (balance, like our arm-swinging movements during walking), experiments have proven that head motions are determined by visual stimuli rather than biomechanical or inner-ear stimulation. \n\nThis is from a research paper:\nhttp://www.biomotionlab.ca/Text/TrojeFrost00.pdf"

My truck veered off the highway. As soon as I felt the truck leave the highway, I woke up and found I was heading downward on the gravel part of the side of the highway. My truck seemed to be driving itself I was in shock. The steering wheel was moving under my hands. I can't describe it any better than this. As the truck moved back up to the highway, I pulled over and tried to calm down. It was a really frightening moment. What was even more frightening was just 1/4 mile more and the side of the highway no longer had gravel. There were large boulders.

His grandson, Patrick, was created Baron Glamis in 1445 and the 9th Lord Glamis was created Earl of Kinghorne in 1606.  \n\nThe 3rd Earl, a Lord of the Treasury and an Extraordinary Lord of Session, was created Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon, Lord Glamis, Tannadyce, Sidlaw and Strathdichtie in 1677.  \n\nThe family, once the richest in Scotland, spent its fortune in the English Civil War. In the 18th century, it recovered when the 9th Earl married a wealthy heiress by the name of Mary Eleanor Bowes. The family name was then changed from Lyon to Bowes.

People who did not accept Jesus...""going to hell"". \n\nSame thing with Islam. ""Non-beleivers"", oh, they get to kill us by law of their Qu'ran, PLUS we all go to hell.

All these things were put here for all of us on Earth, and yet, we war and fight in the name of religions, divided by our view of ""GOD"", even the lack thereof.  Shouldn't this quest be a personal one? Shouldn't one's relationship with their creator be divine unto itself, and need no restrictive guideline to fall into?","Yes, I totally agree that organized religion is divisive and exclusive.  And that our spirituality and quest for a relationship with God is personal.\n\nOrganized religions teach us to live fear-based lives in order to control the masses and advance their own agenda.  They teach people to be mindless sheep and just accept what they are told without question.  They teach us to hate people who follow other religions.  Hate is not God.  Love is God.  We are all on different paths and different points on those paths to the same place.

Where people kill in the name of God (or whatever name they give God).  \n\nI can never accept within my heart that God loves some and not others or that God loves some more than others.  No.  God created us all and loves all of her creations.  \n\nAs far as hell goes, I think that if people believe in hell, they will get it, because our beliefs are powerful creators of our own reality.\n\nI believe in God/Life/Love.

I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie because the movie may be hard to follow if you have not read the book.  At least for me it would have been.\n\nFirst thing you must realize if you are going to read the book, is that it is fiction, and should be taken as FICTION ONLY.  Even though there may be parts which ARE true, you should not get your information about history, religion, and art from a book of fiction.  Absolutely assume that it is all fiction.  Then if you want to later find out where the truth is, you'll just have to do the work of consulting scholarly works, history books, and the Bible as well as the other Gospels that did not make it into the Bible.\n\nSo if you are looking for a good fiction and awesome mystery story, read it and see it.  If you are looking only for historical truth on the matters covered, then do not read it or see it, because it is a terrible source for factual information.  As I say, even though some of the information may be true, you won't be able to know the truth from the falsehood, and there is DEFINITELY falsehood in the book.  Afterall, it IS a fiction novel."

Indian culture is spreadin globally .. the world has started recognisin its true value n its startin to get the respect it deserves.. \nPunjabi songs, south indian dances ,spices , desi foods, our festivals, faces .. they are all so unique n admirable .. but the fact is.. WE R LOSIN IT. The people of India themselves are gettin driven towards western culture.. many cant even speak hindi.. i mean its ok to advance but to forget one's identity doesnt make any sense.. If we forget our culture n just become copy cats of the western world .. then will anyone value us ? think bout it.\n\nI live in the U.S.A n really miss my country.. i guess apeksha u r really lucky"
"2","How do people who believe in God based on logic and not faith, fit God into the theory of evolution?","I am not looking for an answer based on the best story book ever, called the bible, i am referring to an intelligent response which the theory of evolution poses to God's role, namely concerning him as a creator.","I TOTALLy agree with you in that the two concepts are mutually exclusive.  A belief in God (as depicted in the Bible) has ABSOLUTELY NO ROOM for macroevolution.  Similarly, a belief in macroevolution has NO PLACE for God.  \n\nSome individuals try to merge the two, saying that God used macroevolution as THE CREATION MACHINERY. That's like Jews or Muslims saying Jesus was a good man, a great teacher but not the Messiah. THERE'S NO MIDDLE GROUND.  GOD OR EVOLUTION? MESSIAH OR MADMAN?  The choice is yours.\n\nIncidentally, macroevolution has never been proven, either.  BOTH must be accepted on FAITH!!!!"

"2","who can give me some info about Pluto ?","","the planet?Pluto is the farthest planet from the Sun (usually) and by far the smallest. Pluto is smaller than seven of the solar system's moons (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan and Triton). \n\n        orbit:    5,913,520,000 km (39.5 AU) from the Sun (average)\n        diameter: 2274 km\n        mass:     1.27e22 kg\nIn Roman mythology, Pluto (Greek: Hades) is the god of the underworld. The planet received this name (after many other suggestions) perhaps because it's so far from the Sun that it is in perpetual darkness and perhaps because ""PL"" are the initials of Percival Lowell. \nPluto was discovered in 1930 by a fortunate accident. Calculations which later turned out to be in error had predicted a planet beyond Neptune, based on the motions of Uranus and Neptune. Not knowing of the error, Clyde W. Tombaugh at Lowell Observatory in Arizona did a very careful sky survey which turned up Pluto anyway. \nAfter the discovery of Pluto, it was quickly determined that Pluto was too small to account for the discrepancies in the orbits of the other planets. The search for Planet X continued but nothing was found. Nor is it likely that it ever will be: the discrepancies vanish if the mass of Neptune determined from the Voyager 2 encounter with Neptune is used. There is no Planet X. But that doesn't mean there aren't other objects out there, only that there isn't a relatively large and close one like Planet X was assumed to be. In fact, we now know that there are a very large number of smaller objects in the Kuiper Belt beyond the orbit of Neptune. \nPluto is the only planet that has not been visited by a spacecraft. Even the Hubble Space Telescope can resolve only the largest features on its surface (left and above). A spacecraft called New Horizons was launched in January 2006. If all goes well it should reach Pluto in 2015. \nFortunately, Pluto has a satellite, Charon. By good fortune, Charon was discovered (in 1978) just before its orbital plane moved edge-on toward the inner solar system. It was therefore possible to observe many transits of Pluto over Charon and vice versa. By carefully calculating which portions of which body would be covered at what times, and watching brightness curves, astronomers were able to construct a rough map of light and dark areas on both bodies. \nIn late 2005, a team using the Hubble Space Telescope discovered two additional tiny moons orbiting Pluto. Provisionally designated S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2, they will be assigned real names when the discovery is confirmed. They are estimated to be between 60 and 200 kilometers in diameter. \nPluto's radius is not well known. JPL's value of 1137 is given with an error of +/-8, almost one percent. \nThough the sum of the masses of Pluto and Charon is known pretty well (it can be determined from careful measurements of the period and radius of Charon's orbit and basic physics) the individual masses of Pluto and Charon are difficult to determine because that requires determining their mutual motions around the center of mass of the system which requires much finer measurements -- they're so small and far away that even HST has difficulty. The ratio of their masses is probably somewhere between 0.084 and 0.157; more observations are underway but we won't get really accurate data until a spacecraft is sent. \nPluto is the second most contrasty body in the Solar System (after Iapetus). \nThere are some who think Pluto would be better classified as a large asteroid or comet rather than as a planet. Some consider it to be one of the larger Kuiper Belt objects (also known as Trans-Neptunian Objects). There is considerable merit to the latter position, but historically Pluto has been classified as a planet and it is very likely to remain so. Further complicating the situation, one such object (2003UB313) was recently discovered that is almost certainly larger than Pluto. Should it, too, be classified as"

"2","Why infrared signal can be detected by ccd camera?","Why it looks white?","CCDs are naturally sensitive out to about 1000 nm (nanometers), while the human eye can't see much past 760 nm. CCD cameras have infrared blocking filters, but some of them still let a fair amount of infrared in. A quick test of whether your camera is infrared sensitive is to point your TV remote at it and push a button. If it's sensitive, you'll see the IR LED light up in the LCD viewer.\n\nA CCD camera uses red, green, and blue filtered pixels to form a color image. Infrared looks white because apparently all of these pixel filters let IR through."

"1","Where is the missing link between Apes and Humans?","Is it possible that the missing link is in fact an alien hybrid?","Humans did not evolve from apes nor the other way around.  However humans and apes do share a common ancestor.  This ancestor was not human or ape but it was the foundation from which they both evolved on two separate and distinct paths (evolutionary tracts). In fact most people have heard the apes are the closest species related to humans, but the truth is, Chimpanzees are the closet to us, genetically, physically and in mental capabilities. Apes and Humans diverged on separate evolutionary tracks about 8 million years ago while Humans and Chimps only diverged at about 5 million yrs ago.\nThere is a 4% genetic-sequence difference between chimps and Humans, which means that our DNA is 96% identical. But we did not evolve from one another, we just shared a distant, now extinct relative.  Hope this clears things up."

On the surface they move in association with other cells but once they turn the corner around the lip of the primitive streak the cells separate as individuals to migrate internally to form the mesoderm and endoderm. These are just some of the types of cell movements that occur in animal embryos. Here's a full list\n\nIngression: cells break away from the tissue and migrate as individuals \nDelamination: layers of cells separate from each others more or less as sheets of cells \nIntercalation: two cell layers interlace with each other \nEpiboly: a form of cell spreading in which cells flatten out; this allows them to cover a much larger surface area (1st detailed in frog development). \nInvagination (Evagination): a tissue layer folds in (out) \nInvolution: cells move over a lip of tissue and into the interior \nConvergent Extension: cells reorganize to form less layers allowing the cells to extend out from a point. \nNot all of these morphogenetic movements have been detailed in humans but they all have been shown to occur in other animals. Also remember, one type of cellular rearrangement does not exclude another with several different types of movement potentially occurring at the same time."

Just because you found something that could be an ark does not prove God exists. I'm sorry. The bible was written by man, therefore is loaded with flaws and corruption. It is mans interpretation of what was supposed to be God's word. Therefore, it is WRITTEN HISTORY. Of course some of the stories hold truths, because they were written by men! Of course they will include something like a MASSIVE FLOOD. It still doesn't prove God exists.  It could prove there was a massive flood(which we already know has happened on several occasions..melting of the ice caps, perhaps?) and ""Noah"" built it to stay safe. And, maybe Noah did exist.

"1","What do you consider taking up an offence?","In the Bible we are told to not take up an offence.  I have always found it interesting that if you follow the command to take up your cross you would have to lay it down to take up the offence.  As a Christian, laying down my cross is something I don't want to do, so I try very hard to not take up an offence.","Quiet Warrior,\n\nYou have a very good way to look at it. I am reminded that Jesus said, “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.” He was certainly asking His Father not to charge His judges and tormentors and executioners with their offenses against Him, but also they REALLY didn’t understand what they were doing.\n\nIt is very easy to see that they offended Him, but not quite so easy to see that they really didn’t understand what they were doing. Pilate seemed to have a sense that he condemned an innocent man; the high priest uttered prophetically, “It is better for one man to die for all the people,” and the crowd shouted, “His blood be upon us and our children.” One of the thieves realized that Jesus was a good man, and even one of the Roman soldiers realized after Jesus died that He was really the Son of God.\n\nHowever, none of them really understood the significance of what they were doing. That is also true of the people who offend us no matter how deliberate or shrewd they are. If people really understood the nature of their acts, then they wouldn’t do them.\n\nWe all look at an event like 9/11 and are horrified by the carnage, and it is incredible to us that anyone could commit such acts. Osama bin Laden and the other masterminds and perpetrators, in spite of their obvious planning and forethought, had no real concept of what they were doing. If they had your understanding, then they couldn’t have done it, could they?\n\nI can’t understand serial killers or child molesters or rapists or men who hit women, etc. The only way to really understand those things is to be capable of doing them, so I’m thankful that I don’t understand the way they think. By the same token, they don’t understand the way you or I think. It is foreign to them. If they really understood what they were doing then they couldn’t do it, could they?\n\nAnyway, this line of thinking helps me to forgive just as yours does. It is also good to see that if I don’t forgive others, then God can’t forgive me. That’s a really good motivator.\n\nGod bless."

"1","Where did the F word originate and was it originally used as another word for sex?","","F**k is an English word which, when used literally as a verb, means ""to engage in sexual intercourse"". It is generally considered to be an offensive profanity. Its origins may be Germanic, akin to the synonymous German ""ficken"", which had the original meaning, ""to strike"".\n\nIt is unclear whether the word has always been considered vulgar, and if not, when it first started to be considered vulgar. Some evidence indicates that in some English-speaking locales it was considered acceptable as late as the 17th century meaning ""to strike"" or ""to penetrate"". Other evidence indicates that it may have become vulgar as early as the 16th century in England, although neither set of evidence is inherently contradictory to the other, since many words have multiple connotations. The etymology (origin) of the word is uncertain.\n\nThere are several urban-legend false etymologies postulating an acronymic origin for the word. One legend holds that the word f**k came from Irish law. If a couple were caught committing adultery they would be punished ""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge In the Nude"", with ""F U C K I N'"" written on the stocks above them to denote the crime."

"2","what is chondromalacia?","","It is the wearing away and/or softening of the articular cartilage. \n\nThe articular cartilage is a connective tissue that covers and protects the underside of the patella, the bottom end of the femur, and top end of the tibia. It absorbs stress to the knee joint and allows the patella to track smoothly in its femoral groove.\n\nCauses typically include excessive running or similar activity can wear down the articular cartilage over time. This can occur due to the patella not tracking smoothly in its femoral groove.\n\nThe symptoms include pain around the patella (kneecap), usually occurring on the medial (inner) side and below (inferior aspect of the patella).\n\nRecommended Treatment would be R.I.C.E. - Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. Reduce activity to promote healing. Avoid downhill runs especially. Strengthen surrounding muscles with a professionally recommended program. Apply Ice for 10-15 minutes after each workout to reduce inflammation and pain. (If any skin irritation or adverse reaction occurs due to icing, see your medical doctor). A proper stretching (Quadriceps, Iliotibial Band) routine is highly recommended pre and post workouts. As with any orthopedic injury, a consultation with a sports medicine professional is recommended."

"2","How much scientific proof is there for evolution?","","The short answer: a lot!\n\nThe long answer:\n\nScience is not about finding a single piece of evidence to conclusively prove a theory. It's about constructing theories to fit the existing evidence and gathering new evidence that supports or refutes existing theories. Evolution is supported by a preponderance of evidence. While no one point conclusively proves it, when all the evidence is considered in the context of existing scientific knowledge evolution is a well substantiated theory. Intelligent design is not.  What follows are brief explanations of some of the evidence that supports the theory of evolution.\n\n1. Vestigial structures\n\nOne example of a vestigial structure in humans is the appendix. It has no function. Removing it is harmful only in so far as any surgery is associated with certain risks (so I wouldn't have it removed just for fun, but it's because of the surgery not the absence of the appendix). An appendix is found in several mammals. In humans it is small and has no known function. In rabbits and many other herbivores it is large and is used in the digestion of cellulose.\n\nAnother example of a vestigial structure is the hipbones of snakes. Snakes evolved from quadrupeds, and some species still retain not on pelvises, but tiny protrusions of bone in a location that corresponds to the location of the legs in other quadrupeds.\n\n2. Microevolution can be observed in both a controlled laboratory setting and in nature.\n\nCreationists will tell you that microevolution does not prove macroevolution.  This is true.  However, it does provide evidence that macroevolution may be possible. Taken in the context of the other evidence for evolution, microevolution provides a mechanism by which macroevolution could occur. On its own, it doesn't prove that macroevolution occurs, but it does suggest that it is possible.\n\n3. The fossil record.\n\nAlthough the fossil record does not provide a “complete” record as fossils form only under certain conditions, it does show a gradual change in the morphology of species as well as numerous extinct species.  There are a number of methods used to date fossils, and the time period from which a fossil comes can be determined with reasonable accuracy.\n\n4. Imperfect structures (the blind spot of the mammalian eye, for example).\n\nI want to mention the bind-spot of the mammalian eye specifically because creationists often hold up the human eye up as an example of something that is too perfect to occur by ""chance"" (i.e. as the result of the natural selection of beneficial changes among random mutations).\n\nThere are also numerous examples where the morphology of a species is constrained by similar patterns in its ancestors (quadrupeds, vertebrates, etc.).\n\n5. Developmental biology reflects evolutionary lineage.\n\nCreationists like to bring up a man named Haeckel in response to this argument.  Haeckel suggested that development reflects evolutionary origin.  It was later discovered that several of the sketches he used as evidence over-exaggerated certain features, and some were of different embryos all together. However, many of his sketches do accurately reflect the morphology of the embryo. Haeckel's methods were sometimes wrong and his ethics were poor, but it just so happens that his theory turned out to be fairly accurate.\n\nAny developmental biologist can tell you that embryos of related species show similar morphology in the early stages of development. The point at which their development begins to diverge shows a strong correlation with the relative point at which the evolution of the two species diverged. Human embryos look similar to chimpanzee embryos for a lot longer than they look similar to cat embryos, but all three develop similar structures in the early stages of development. The early embryos of humans, chimps, and cats are similar to each other but quite different from, say, a sea urchin embryo. This is based on photograp"

"2","where to learn how to Balance Equations?","I was just wondering, besides using a Chemisty or any kind of book, what internet site can i use that will help teach me how to balance equations in 48 hours. I already know what ""ions, radicalals"" and stuff are. I just need the steps on how to Balance an equation.","Balancing Chemical Equations is absolutely essential if you want to determine quantities of reactants or products. An unbalanced Chemical Equation gives only the identify of the beginning reactants and the final products using the appropriate formulas as well as the conditions of temperature, physical state, and pressure conditions under which the reaction is to operate under. However an unbalanced equation can say nothing about the quantities involved until the equation has been balanced. A balanced equation assures that the Conservation Law of matter is obeyed. The total mass of reactants must equal the total mass of products. A balanced equation is like a recipe. It tells you the proportional quantities of each substance involved. The coefficients that appear to the left of each formula can be interpreted as mole units or molecules, but for practical purposes, the coefficients will be interpreted as mole units. No coefficient is interpreted as 1 mole. The following principles should be employed when balancing a Chemical Equation by inspection:\n\n   1. Never touch subscripts when balancing equations since that will change the composition and therefore the substance itself.\n   2. Check to be sure that you have included all sources of a particular element that you are balancing on a particular side since there may be two or more compounds that contain the same element on a given side of an equation.\n   3. I would suggest that you adjust the coefficient of mono atomic elements near the end of the balancing act since any change in their coefficient will not affect the balance of other elements\n   4. When there are a group of atoms that are acting as a unit such as a polyatomic ion and they appear intact on both sides of the equation, it is best to balance them as a self contaned group. For example, if there are Phosphate groups, PO4-3, that appear on both sides, balance the phosphates as a group instead of separating the Phosphorus and Oxygens. It can be done either way, but there is less likely of a mistake if they are balanced as Phosphate groups.\n\nConsider the example of:\n\n(NH4)2CO3 ---> NH3 + CO2 + H2O\n\nThe first thing to do is choose a starting point. If we choose the carbon as the starting point, we go nowhere, since there is already one carbon on each side. Choosing oxygen is not good, because the oxygen is divided between two species on the right side. The interesting part is in the ammonium (NH4) ion. If we start with the nitrogen on the left (in the ammonium ion), we see that there are two nitrogens and therefore we must put at ""2"" in front of the ammonia on the right side.\n\n(NH4)2CO3 ---> 2 NH3 + CO2 + H2O\n\nSince we are already working with the ammonia, now consider the hydrogens that make up the rest of the molecule: the six hydrogens in the ammonia plus the two hydrogens in the water make eight hydrogens. Bouncing back across to the left side, we count eight hydrogens; since no other atomic species have been changed, we can count up everything and see that the reaction is now balanced:\n\n2 N, 8 H, 1 C, and 3 O on each side.\n\nNotice how the reaction itself led us through the steps of the balancing process. A more complex reaction would have involved more steps, but the process would have been the same.\n\nThis ""inspection method"" is the first one tried by chemists in the real world. Only when it fails to work, as in the case of many oxidation-reduction reactions, for example, are more complex procedures used.\n\nHere is another example:\n\nFe2(SO4)3 + K(SCN) ----> K3Fe(SCN)6 + K2SO4\n\nK3Fe(SCN)6 is pretty complicated. Now look at it and see what ions are in it that are not shared on the same side of the reaction. These are SCN and Fe.\n\nWe start to balance these\n\nFe2(SO4)3 + 6 K(SCN) ---> K3Fe(SCN)6 + K2SO4 Now we go left to right.\n\nThe irons are messed up, two on the Left, and one on the right. We adjust\n\nFe2(SO4)3 + 6 K(SCN) -- 2 K3Fe(SCN)6 + K2SO4 .\n\nNow t"

I can personally attest that this is true in my life and in the life of my children.\n\nBut remember that this is in the Old Testament. If we are Born Again by accepting Jesus as our Lord, believing that God raised him from the dead, then we have a better covenant (testament) based on better promises in what we call the New Testament.

"1","The legacy of colonization?","Are the problems of modern Africa the result of colonization by the European powers in the late 19th century, or did Africa derive more benefit than harm from colonization?","Yes. Europeans imported the concept of nationalism to Africa, which is meaningless to people that have expressed loyalty toward their own ethnic group or culture than their ""nation"". If you look at a place like Nigeria, there are several different languages spoken there besides English.\n  At the Berlin Conference of 1888, when European nations carved up Africa for themselves, that did it irregardless of the cultures in the region. Nationalism is one issue that African nations are going to adjust to.\n  Also, I would have to agree with the first answer, European customs have done away with the modes of government that have worked for them, long before Europe was even interested in African colonization.\n  Another issue is the issue of education. Europe used Africa for raw goods and resources and left Africans in a poor position to function well on their own. One example is the Congo. The Belgians robbed the Congo of their natural resources( Congo is one of the most resource abundant nations on Earth, yet it is one of the poorest) and left the Congelese uneducated. All of the professionals in the Congo such as doctors, etc were all Belgian.By analogy, Botswana also was colonized by Britain, and they are well-educated and have incorporated ancient customs with Western ideas.\n  In short, nationalism, education, and erosion of some of Africa's ancient forms of government are some of the causes of the problems in Africa today."

"2","What is a neutron bomb and how it works?","","""Tactical neutron bombs are primarily intended to kill soldiers who are protected by armor. Armored vehicles are very resistant to blast and heat produced by nuclear weapons, but steel armor can reduce neutron radiation only by a modest amount so the lethal range from neutrons greatly exceeds that of other weapon effects. The lethal range for tactical neutron bombs can exceed the lethal range for blast and heat even for unprotected troops. Armor can absorb neutrons and neutron energy, thus reducing the neutron radiation to which the tank crew is exposed, but this offset to some extent by the fact that armor can also react harmfully with neutrons. Alloy steels for example can develop induced radioactivity that remains dangerous for some time. When fast neutrons are slowed down, the energy lost can show up as x-rays. Some types of armor, like that of the M-1 tank, employ depleted uranium which can undergo fast fission, generating additional neutrons and becoming radioactive. Special neutron absorbing armor techniques have also been developed, such as armors containing boronated plastics and the use of vehicle fuel as a shield.""\n\nreference: http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Outlaws/faq1\n\n""Also called ENHANCED RADIATION WARHEAD, specialized type of small thermonuclear weapon that produces minimal blast and heat but which releases large amounts of lethal radiation. The neutron bomb delivers blast and heat effects that are confined to an area of only a few hundred yards in radius. But within a somewhat larger area it throws off a massive wave of neutron and gamma radiation, which can penetrate armour or several feet of earth. This radiation is extremely destructive to living tissue. Because of its short-range destructiveness and the absence of long-range effect, the neutron bomb would be highly effective against tank and infantry formations on the battlefield but would not endanger cities or other population centres only a few miles away. It can be carried in a Lance missile or delivered by an 8-inch (200-millimetre) howitzer, or possibly by attack aircraft.\n\nIn strategic terms, the neutron bomb has a theoretical deterrent effect: discouraging an armoured ground assault by arousing the fear of neutron bomb counterattack. The bomb would disable enemy tank crews in minutes, and those exposed would die within days. U.S. production of the bomb was postponed in 1978 and resumed in 1981.""\n\nreference: http://www.britannica.com/seo/n/neutron-bomb/"

"2","explain how unstable nuclei become stable by releasing radiation?","","Atoms are most stable at certain energy levels.  If an atom goes above a particular level, it will release energy to go back.  Most of the time, this occurs as electromagnetic radiation, where an electron drops to a lower shell and releases heat (infrared light), light, or more energetic radiation (like x-rays).\n\nIn the case of radioactive decay or nuclear fission, the released radiation is in the form of nuclear particles: alpha particles are helium nuclei (no electrons) and have low energy, and beta particles are electrons, which are higher energy.  Gamma rays are electromeagnetic, not particulate, so they are just photons, and have very high energy."

"2","I have a science project that has to be the shape of a volcano, it has to be eatable and it has to erupt?","","Edible Volcano\n\nBefore \nAfter, showing pump and tube\n\nMany students build a volcano as a school project. This one looks great, works well, and is edible too!\n\nA small plastic bottle forms a container for the lava. Choose a bottle appropriate for the size of volcano you are making. Realize that it takes lots of mountain material to build a large volcano! The volcano picture above was made with 5 batches.\n\nA small hand-held water balloon pump, available at toy stores, is attached to a piece of flexible plastic tubing, available at hardware stores, pet shops, etc.\n\nThis tube can simply pass under the mountain, or for better appearance mount the volcano on a large flat cardboard box and pass the tubing through the box and out the side. IF you are using a box, make holes and pass the tubing through the box now.\n\nThe tubing passes through a small hole in the bottle. Pass it all the way up through and out the top, where you can attach a balloon. The pull the tube back down so the balloon is in the bottom of the bottle. Fix the tube in place and seal the opening with wax, hot glue, or similar. If you intend to eat the results, seal it with something non-toxic.\n\nThe main mountain material is Rice Krispy Treats. The recipe can be found on any cereal box of at the Rice Krispies web site. The mountain is shaped from this material, and then coated with peanut butter playdough (recipe below) and/or frosting. Use chocolate and vanilla frosting in various mixtures to create a variety of shades of color. Other edible materials can be used as well. Spray frosting, available in the cake decorating section of many grocery stores, comes in green and can be used to spray on realistic looking green colors.\n\nThe lava can be a variety of materials including honey colored red with food coloring, strawberry flavored ice cream topping, whipped topping thinned and dyed red, etc. Red sprinkles, red colored sugar, bits of marshmallow cream, or other ""additives"" gane give it a chuhnky, textured look if desired.\n\nFill the bottle with lava material, and pump up the ballon with the hand pump, pushing the lava out of the bottle and down the sides of the volcano.\n\n\nPEANUT BUTTER DOUGH INGREDIENTS:\n\n* 3 1/2 cups peanut butter\n* 4 cups confectioners' sugar\n* 3 1/2 cups honey\n* 4 cups dry milk powder\nHome\n\n© Copyright 2004 by Bill Lovegrove.

"1","textbook for advanced grammar/composition in Spanish?","do you know of any textbook used at american universities in advanced grammar/composition courses for Spanish majors/minors?? (not lower level courses).","I haven't taken any such course in Spanish, but I have for other languages.  Advanced courses frequently don't have textbooks because textbooks explain grammar and have short readings and exercises.  At the higher levels of language, you're expected to know the grammar, so you might use a grammar *reference* but not a textbook, and you'll probably be reading real literature instead of readings constructed to use limited vocabulary.  And your composition assignments will probably be defined by the teacher.  \n\nI can recommend this book for advanced grammar reference: A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish, by John Butt and Carmen Benjamin."
"1","When you're in a shopping mall, is it easy to tell what city or state you're in?","If you were to walk into four shopping malls in vastly different areas of the US, would it be easy for you tell--for example if you were in Buffalo, Minneapolis, Denver, Seattle or Mobile?","Except for speech patterns of the customers, and the obvious difference in apparel--like tons of winter stuff up north and none of it down here in the south--today's malls are clones.   Even the strip malls look the same.  \n\nI travel a lot, and it's almost impossible to tell where I am anymore by the interior or exterior of a mall.   The newer strip malls in Florida all strive to look like Miami-cool, even in Pensacola or St. Augustine.   I think it's a shame that they don't play up the differences and uniqueness of a city, but these malls are apparently also the work of the developers who spin out the cookie cutter housing developments.    Ever tried to find a specific house in a new development where you can't see the house numbers?  \n\nIn Florida, just look for the split level, pink/gray or sand color stucco exterior with white trim, with requisite garage as you first turn in the driveway.....good luck.   I like the older neighborhoods that have a little character.  I also like it better when the post offices were in older buildings, instead of the blue and brick clone, and when I could tell if I was in California or Florida or Detroit.\n\nOh well.   They say older folks don't adapt well to change.   This isn't change, this is overbearing sameness."

As pine stripe notes it depends on when they were blinded. People blinded after about 5 years of age have no problems. People blinded before that have difficulty re-adjusting.\n\nPeople blind from birth are really quite interesting when their site is restored. They never have any ability to judge perspective. They can recognise small cubes up close for example, but they see cubic buildings and truncated pyramids. That's because a building looks like it gets smaller at the top due to perspective. A person blind from birth can never learn to recognise that that is just an illusion. they literally see the building with a small top and large base. They also see railway tracts as converging lines and are fooled by similar tricks of perspective that sighted people automatically adjust for.\n\nWeird stuff."

Then g' = 1, so we get:\nintegral(t sin 2t) = -0.5tcos2t - integral(-0.5cos2t * 1)\nThat last integral now just becomes -0.25sin2t.\nSo the answer is -0.5tcos 2t + 0.25sin2t (+c)."

"1","Why does church take some books so offensively if, sometimes, they are fiction?","","I think the church has a lot of different motivations for why they take offense to certain books.  There is the simple offense, where people deem certain content inappropriate because it is morally questionable.  For example, a group of parents discover a book that includes violence or sex inappropriate for their children and want to protest or boycott to have the offensive content removed.  The motivation is straight forward not surreptitious.  The solution is to restrict expose for the children you are responsible for, but it is extreme to try to decide what is appropriate for other people.  The second reason is not so pure.  The church may fear the challenge of different ideas.  They may feel that it weakens their power or control over people and situations.  Case in point, literature that is pro-birth control or not anti-abortion may be banned by the church because it challenges what they say and they may loose control over people when individuals read the information and become educated by the information.  The church used to only allow the Bible to be translated into Latin so that only a select few could read it and they would only share ideas that they wanted people to be exposed to.  This gave them control to manipulate the masses; it robbed people of their right to make their own decisions and to educate themselves.  I believe the church still engages in this practice and it is manifested in the church becoming offended and banning."

Where can I find information about it???","1)  Christianity was NOT the first religion.  \n2)  Judaism was technically not the first religion, either.  Judaism did not come about until Moses.  While God was worshiped before Moses, as we read in the Bible, there was no formal religion.  Adam, Noah, Joshua, etc., had no formal religion as we typically think of; therefore, when Pagans claim that their religion is the oldest, technically they are correct, and the Bible confirms it.\n3)  Other religions start for various reasons.  L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology) and Joseph Smith (Mormonism) seemed to be financially motivated.  Islam seemed to be more racially motivated.  Most New Age and modern Pagan beliefs seem to be motivated by the desire to BE God (they desire ""special power"").  That is really what almost all false beliefs (including most false religious sects) are about...  getting to be God.  Deciding for one self what is right and wrong.  Wanting to be like God.  That is what Satan tempted Eve with in the Garden, and that is what drives us away today."

What do you think would be found?","Well, I don't know if you meant Universe's or a Gaalaxy, but assuming you meant Universes...\n\nThe word Universe is used to to describe the entire physical world. Meaning everything that is in space, every planet, star, comet, etc. is all part of the Universe.\n\nWhat some physicists have speculated, is that there may be ""alternate universes"". Universes that we cannot see because they are in different dimensions then we are. \n\nWe live in a four dimensional world. We have the three dimensions of 1. up an down, 2. right and left, 3.back and forth, and 4. time. \n\nIt is hard to comprehend extra dimensions, but some physicts have speculated that the extra dimensions may be incredibly small, and every time we move, we push them aside, but not into them.\n\nIt get's rather complicated, but this theory is used in some modern physics theories, such as String Theory.\n\nWe cannot access alternate universes even if they do exist, because we do not live in those dimensions. So as far as we know, the answer is no.\n\nYou also have to realize how incredibly vast space is. Astronomers use ""light-years"" to measure distance in space. 1 light-year is the distance light would travel in 1 earth year. That is a very, very large distance. So it is difficult to send spacecraft anywhere far even in our own universe.\n\nI am no expert though, and would reccomend searching wikipedia.org for answers.\n\nGood luck!"
"1","Which religion has the most ""Soldiers of God"" ?","","Islam and Christianity both have a history of using religion to justify violence, ethnic cleansing, and war.  I would find it hard to claim one is more bloody than the other.\n\nOf course, Islamic extremists would justify the perception that jihad - ""holy war"" makes Islam the religion with the most ""soldiers of god"" today.\n\nBut looking back in history, Christianity was used to justify the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and colonization and ethnic cleansing of Native Americans.\n\nBoth religions are just as bloody.  And I would probably say that Christianity has been used to justify the deaths of more people than Islam.  Terrorists pluck off a few at a time, maybe a thousand in a big attack.  Wars fought by Christians killed many, many more."

"2","How does ionic radius affect the solubility of a salt?","","It determines the number of ligands the ion can be surrounded with, both in the crystal and in solution. (Electronic configuration dictates the likely geometry.)\n\nThere is no direct correlation. Stability of the salt depends among other factors from the ionic character of the salt - some of the badly soluble sulfides have bonds with covalent character.\n\nThe energy gain from dissolving the salt (allowing free movement of formerly ordered crystals) has to be greater than the energy required to leave the crystal. Usually the ionic ligands in the salt crystal are replaced by water molecules."

"2","How and why do lava lamps work?","This is for my Science NCEA level, so I really need as many different reasons as possible, and not the stuff from Wikipedia, as I've alreadt got that.","The lamp consists of an illuminating bulb, and a glass bottle containing a transparent liquid, translucent wax, and a metallic wire coil. The glass bottle sits on top of the bulb, which heats its contents. The metallic wire coil is hidden in the base of the lamp, which the glass bottle is sitting on.\n\nThe wax is slightly denser than the liquid at room temperature, and slightly less dense than the liquid under marginally warmer conditions. This happens because the wax expands more than the liquid when heated.\n\nThe light bulb heats the container at the bottom, and due to heat exchange with the atmosphere, the container eventually dissipates the introduced heat. This method of heat transfer is called convection.\n\nWax at the bottom heats until it melts, and eventually becomes less dense than the liquid above it. At this time, a portion of the wax rises towards the top of the container. Near the top, away from the heat source, the wax cools, contracts, and as its density increases it begins to fall through the liquid towards the bottom of the container again. The difference in temperature between the top and bottom of the globe is only a few degrees.\n\nOne mass of wax may rise as another falls. The metal coil at the bottom helps to overcome the surface tension of the individual wax droplets, causing the descending blobs to agglomerate into a single molten wax mass at the bottom of the container. The cycle of rising and falling wax droplets continues so long as the bottom of the container remains warm and the top of the container remains cool. Operating temperatures of lava lamps vary, but are normally around 60 °C (140 °F). If too low or too high a wattage bulb is used in the base, the ""lava"" ceases to circulate, either remaining quiescent at the bottom (too cold) or all rising to the top (too hot).\n\nChaotic behaviour makes the movement of the wax unpredictable—hence lava lamps can aid in the generation of one-time pads for cryptographic use.\n\nThe colour of the wax and the liquid often varies and can be found in many different combinations."

"2","Why is the desity of salt water greater than fresh water?","","The density of water is greatly affected by salinity, or the salt concentration.  When salts are dissolved into pure water, the density of water increases because the salts have a greater density than the water; thus freshwater floats on salt water.  This is also why your ability to float differs between a swimming pool and an ocean."

"2","what is really in the bermuda triangle?","","Under the ocean floor all over the world, there are pockets of Methane. When this methane erupts and bubbles to the surface, it lowers the density of the water, causing a floating ship to sink instantly to the bottom of the column of gas and water and into the hole from where the gas emerged. When the sand settles, it settles into the hole, back over the ship, so no wreckage is found.\n\nAs for planes, the column of methane travels skyward, lowering the density of the air, and the same principle applies, complete with a quick trip to the bottom and a watery grave. No wreckage.\n\nThe Bermuda Triangle has twice the methane deposits of the rest of the world.\n\nJust a theory, but what do you think?\n\nkeptcompany@yahoo.com"

"1","Are people basically good or evil and why do you think this is so?","","I think that all people are good. For some reasons some of them follow the good some others evil or bad. It deppens on their life, religion, mind, education e.t.c Theories of goodness inquire into what sorts of things are good, and what the word ""good"" really means in the abstract.\nAll religions and most philosophical movements have been concerned with good to some degree. It can define ""good"" and ""bad"" for a community or society. It affects everyone's life, and maybe all life on Earth, in the way people organize themselves in societies, and even how they think.\n\nThe duality of 'good versus evil' is expressed, in some form or another, by many cultures. This concept describes a hierarchy of moral standards applied to human behaviour. In more casual  use, the word ""evil"" can characterize people and behaviours that are hurtful, ruinous, or disastrous. Those who believe in the duality theory of evil believe that evil cannot exist without good, nor good without evil, as they are both objective states and opposite ends of the same scale.\n\nIn modern slang, ""bad"" has become a synonym for ""good"", as in ""Man, that's a bad piece of music.""  The ability to choose between good and evil is also a major theme of the philosophy. \nIn our life we have this abbility and we try to follow the better way. Usually our good is not your good.\nIf you want to learn more see Wikipedia"

For example, satellites in low earth orbits -- arguably in ""space"" -- experience much more drag than satellites in higher, geosynchronous orbits.  So, you just have to define a distance as the edge of the sky and the beginning of space.  Here is a commonly accepted definition; read the rest of the article by following the link:\n\n""The Kármán line is an internationally designated altitude commonly used to define outer space. According to definitions by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the Karman or Kármán line lies at a height of 100 km (about 62 miles) above Earth's surface (ie. in technical terms 100 km above mean sea level).

"1","Why is agnosticism the fastest growing ""Religion"" in the world?","Objective reasons only, please. No sermons.","I am sorry you have received some really harsh answers to this question.  I believe your answer can be found in the definition of agnosticism.  \n\nThe doctrine that certainty about first principles or absolute truth is unattainable and that only perceptual phenomena are objects of exact knowledge. \n\nThe belief that there can be no proof either that God exists or that God does not exist.\n\nAsk yourself one more question, especially in regards to the root of all churches, the Catholic Church.  What is it they claim their Holy Trinity to be?  He or They are the answer to all questions.  The beginning to understanding and the end to suffering.  This to me is a wonderful belief to hold.  It gives some a sense of comfort.  However, this belief for many is difficult to understand given scientific reasoning, current global situations, and the reputation of the Christian faith.\n\nAgnostics are easy to equate in this manner.  Say you had been blind your entire life, and all your life everyone told you the sky was blue.  You would form this idea of an unidentified ""blue.""  Then one-day science comes along with a cure for your ailment.  The first thing you want to see is the sky.  When you look at it, it looks nothing like your idea of ""blue.""  Had you been wrong your entire life?  No.  Your concept of the idea of ""blue"" has no shifted from an idea to a reality.  Same thing with agnostics.  They have an idea of a higher power.  Yet since they have not physical proof of this power, it remains an idea.  Nothing more than that.\n\nI hope this helps."

I'm so confused.","OK, first let's try to figure out the arctan part.  Arctan(-1) means the angle whose tangent is -1, right?  And the tangent is the sine divided by the cosine.  So you're looking for angles whose sines and cosines are equal, but with opposite signs.  They point out to the right and down, or out to the left and up, at 45-degree angles.  That means the angles are 135 degrees and 315 degrees, or 3pi/4 and 7pi/4 radians.\n\nNow, the question asked you to find the sines of these two angles.  The sine of 3pi/4 is sqrt(2)/2, and the sine of 7pi/4 is -sqrt(2)/2.  So your answer is +/- sqrt(2)/2."

If you think about it, their gravity would increase and decrease if that was the case, but always remain far above zero.  So....if you could cancel it with a gravity wave generated by another source that was identical and just out-of-phase, you should still have a baseline gravity that was nonzero.  \n       In other words, no negative gravity (that I know of) so when it cancels, it's not zero."

"2","Why we see stars in black and white, not living color  ????","","The color of the star as we perceive it depends on two factors: the intrinsic color of the star and the sensitivity of the human eye. The star can have all kinds of colors from dull red (the coolest stars) via yellow and green to blue (the hottest stars). However, our eye is evolved in the light of the sun and is most sensitive to yellow.\n\nThe result is that we perceive most stars as white, with a few exceptions. Some stars look red, bluish? For instance in the constellation Orion, Betelgeuse is a bright red star at the top left corner, and Rigel is the bright blue star at the bottom right corner. You may want to use binoculars to see the colors more clearly."

The mesophyll cells are between the bundle-sheath cells and the leaf surface, and are rather loosely arranged.\n\nI think the answers are slightly weird, because the Calvin cycle is only occurring in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath. The reason that C4 plants are more efficient is that the mesophyll cells incorporate carbon dioxide into organic compounds, effectively pumping carbon dioxide into the bundle sheath, which keeps the carbon dioxide concentration in the bundle-sheath cells high enough for the Calvin cycle to function properly.\n\nIn any event, the answer is definitely not A, B, or D."

Assuming uniform density p, we have M(r) = (4/3)*Pi*r^3*p, so a(r) = G*(4/3)*Pi*r*p. If we let k = G*(4/3)*Pi*p, which is a constant, we get the ubiquitous equation a(r) = k*r, or d^2r/dt^2 = k*r, which we all know the solution to as the simple harmonic oscillator r(t)=A*cos(Sqrt[k]*t + B) where in our case A is the radius of the Earth and B=0.\nTo complicate matters, due to the presence of some pretty dense air, it will be necessary to add dampening conditions to the differential equation, giving a damped oscillator.\nAlso, the Earth is spinning and since the ball is not rigidly connected to it, it experiences a Coriolis ""force"" towards the tunnel walls in addition to its oscillation, which will surely cause it to at least stop prematurely.\nIt is more likely the ball will be destroyed by hitting the sides of the tunnel at high velocity. ;)"

Most interestingly they are a relitively recent phenomenon. I am thinking that they are something quite separate from ghosts... I have never heard of someone being physically harmed by a shadow person.. but people do find them terrorfying. Who knows what they are! I know this doesn't answer your question... but I hope it helps."

"2","Life in Discovery?","What does the statement ""Life in discovery"" mean to you?","The human race is very intellectual, full of potential but above all is a race of curiosity.\n\nOur curiosity drives us foward in finding new answers to previously unanswerable questions.

They've just changed in different ways to adapt to their environment. Evolution has made them very well adapted to living in trees, e.g. long prehensile tails and both ""hands"" and ""feet"" that can grip.

"1","Why do believers of god feel the need to force their beliefs on others?","I know not all of them do, but most of the people who believe in god that I have encountered say ""If you don't serve god you, serve the devil."" I belive in freedom of religion. And I don't have one. Why is that such a bad thing for religious people? Same with people who believe in the devil. They say the same thing. Why is religion such an important thing? It only seperates different religious people. This is the same as racism in a sense. Racism is when you think one race is better than the other and with religion believers of god believe they are better than people who dont have a religion. I don't understand how they are better if they are like this. Religion should be a choice, not a neccesity. Noone should have to be told what they belive in. Why does the USA revolve around god? They right IN GOD WE TRUST on money and make you swear to god in court. I don't have anything against people with a religion, but it bothers me that they try to force it on others.","God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to."

"2","How does salt afffect the boiling point of water?","","To turn liquid water into steam the weak bonds between the molecules have to be broken and the molecules accelerated enough to leave the water surface and become vapour. This requires energy supplied by heating. \n\nNow add salt.\n\nThe salt consists of NaCl crystals. In water these dissolve into Na+ and Cl- ions. These ions will become surrounded by water molecules that are attracted to them, forming large clumps of molecules. To break these bonds requires more energy than in the case where the salt was absent.\n\nWe have to supply this extra energy and the result is boiling at a higher temperature."
"2","Who discovered the atom oxygen?","","Oxygen was first discovered by Michał Sędziwój, Polish alchemist and philosopher in late 16th century. Sędziwój assumed the existence of oxygen by warming nitre (saltpeter). He thought of the gas given off as ""the elixir of life"".\n\nOxygen was again discovered by the Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele sometime before 1773, but the discovery was not published until after the independent discovery by Joseph Priestley on August 1, 1774, who called the gas dephlogisticated air (see phlogiston theory). Priestley published his discoveries in 1775 and Scheele in 1777; consequently Priestley is usually given the credit. It was named by Antoine Laurent Lavoisier after Priestley's publication in 1775."

Do these things affect air travel or space flight? thanks... i need easy to understand details...","Well I do not think that the Mpemba effect depends on superheating or supercooling. Superheating is dangerous to try at home but probably needs distilled water. Supercooling is probably also hard to achieve at home and probably also should be done with distilled water. I do not know what hot ice is. \n\nThere are places on the web where you can read about the Mpemba effect, and lots of experiments to test this. I do not think you need distilled water to try it yourself, but since we do not really understand the Mpemba effect, it might work better with distilled water. That would be an interesting hypothesis to test. \n\nI do not think that the Mpemba effect has a huge effect on air travel or space flight. Supercooling has a big effect on air travel because supercooled moisture can suddenly cause ice on an airplane. I do not think it has much of an effect on space flight, except as the rocket or space vehicle is traveling through the atmosphere. \n\nThere appear to be a number of applications of superheating in aerospace engineering, in materials proecessing and fuel systems.

The traditional definition is that morality means a system or set of beliefs that define what is good or bad.\n\nTo that end, religion and religious traditions, whether Eastern or Wester, certainly due provide a system of beliefs in what is right or wrong - or morality.\n\nThe real question, is this . . . which religious tradition (i.e., Judeo-Christian, Hindu, Islamic, etc.,) provides the ""best"" system for morality? To answer that question ones must become familiar with the sacred writing and teachings of a given relgious tradition.\n\nMust morality depnd on religion exclusively?  Not necessarily, but it is hard to think of one signficant moral tradition or belief (e.g., don't steal, don't kill) that is not rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition.\n\nI believe the statement that morality is relative is simply ridiculous.  Moral traditions created by man are relative; but the Judeo-Christian view is that God gave the Law and thus Judeo-Christian morality is based on the character and nature of God, which is anything but relative.  God is absolute, and the final authroity on what is true, good or not."
"2","what is helium? im doing a science project!?","for my science fair project.","Helium (from Greek Hêlios: god of the sun) is a chemical element; its atomic symbol is He. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and nearly inert monatomic that heads the noble gas series in the periodic table. Its atomic number is 2 and its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements. It exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions. Extreme conditions are also needed to create the small handful of helium compounds, which are all unstable at standard temperature and pressure. Its most abundant stable isotope is helium-4 and it has a rare stable isotope, helium-3. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two different states—helium I and helium II—is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the phenomenon of superfluidity) and those looking at the effects that near absolute zero temperatures have on matter (such as superconductivity).\n\nHelium is the second most abundant element in the known Universe and second lightest element in the periodic table. In the modern Universe almost all new helium is created as a result of the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth it is created by the radioactive decay of much heavier elements (alpha particles are helium-4 nuclei produced by alpha-decay).\n\nEvidence of helium was first detected on August 18, 1868 as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometres in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun, by French astronomer Pierre Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 line, for it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium, and concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. He and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (helios)."

Also assuming that you aren't really trying to shuffle them into order. Based on the odds of this being a happenstance.","Shuffling is pretty complex as you probably mean a riffle shuffle or something like that.  But let's assume you're shuffling by spreading out all the cards on the table, and randomly picking them.\n\nAssuming you want the cards in a specific order, then for each card, you'd have to randomly select the ""right"" card.  For the first card, you have 52 to choose from, and a 1/52 chance of getting it right.  For the second card, you now have 51 to choose from and thus a 1/51 chance of getting it right...on down to the last card.\n\nSo your odds are:\n\n1/52 * 1/51 * 1/50 * 1/49 * ... * 1/3 * 1/2 * 1/1\n\nor 1/52! or about 1/8*10^69.

Dan Brown's book claims Jesus in not divine or God, and the gospels as we know them, have been changed, and after Jesus stay here on earth, men raised his status to the level of God. Could any of this be true?\n\nAncient secrets of the Church, hidden for centuries have actually been revealed and published in books prior to the fictional writings of Brown in the Da Vinci Code. Baigent and Leigh have produced other books from researchers point of view over the last two decades, including ""Dead Sea Scrolls Deception"", ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"", and ""Messianic Legacy."" These books were the talk of the religious communities when they came out in the early 90's and certianly they have fueled an ongoing interest into just exactly who was this man Jesus, what was his message and what happened to him?\n\nIslam claims to ""break the code"" so to speak, over 1,400 years ago. The answer, according to Muslm scholars has been in the Quran for over fourteen hundred years \n\nSome may be surprised to learn, Muslims believe in the miracle birth and other miracles associated with Jesus. They actually consider him as the ""Messiah"" and they even say, ""peace be upon him"" when mentioning his name. However, they are quick to negate any connection between God and Jesus as a partnership or God-head, and they rule out the notion of God having any son (or daughter for that matter).\n\nHere is how Muslim scholars present their understanding and ""break the code"": \n\nHow Muslim scholars ""broke the code"": \n\nCreation itself tells us there is a creator and from the beginning of time – Allah, (the One God in Arabic) alone is to be worshiped. This is clear teaching throughout the Old testament (Torah), the scriptures that Jesus himself read and taught from. God is one not one of three; for example: ‘He is God; there is no other besides Him’. (Deuteronomy 4:35). The same is mentioned in the book of Mark in the New Testament, chapter 12, verse 29, when Jesus, peace be upon him, had been asked about the Greatest Commandment he replied, ""To know, O Israel, the Lord your God is One Lord; and you have to love Him with all your heart and all your mind and all your strength.""\n\nAccording to the oldest and most authentic copies of manuscipts and scrolls available throughout the centuries, Jesus, peace be upon him, never claimed to be God, or the creator, or the One to pray to, nor did he tell his followers to revere him as God. These notions appear on the lips of others who came along decades and even centuries later. \n\nWhile Jesus was on earth he did not claim to be the creator or ask us to revere him as God. His miraculous birth is a sign of his prophethood: “Verily, the likeness of Jesus before Allah, is the likeness of Adam. He (Allah) created him from dust and said “Be!” and he was” (Quran 3:59). Like all the great and noble prophets of Allah such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, Isaac and David, Jesus came with one message: Worship, love, obey and submit to the one true God, Allah, the creator of everything and do not worship anything besides Allah.\n\nThroughout history, people have taken to worship things or people alongside Allah, or just worshiping something else like power, status or money. Even the names of religions seem have more to do with the creation and less or nothing to do with the Creator. For example: Buddhism – Buddha (the name of a man), Confucianism – Confucius (the name of a man), Hinduism – Hind (the name of an area), Judaism – Judah (the name of a tribe) and Christianity – Christ (the name of a great prophet).\n\nIslam is different. Islam is a word coming from the verb ""aslama"" and it carries the meaning of ""surrender"", ""submission"", ""obedience"", ""sincerity"" and ""peace"" between you and Almighty Alla"

"2","How age of fossils calculated?","","No, no, no!   It is *not* carbon dating!  This is a common misconception (happily encouraged by creationists).\n\nCarbon dating (or radiocarbon dating) is just one of *many* forms of radiometric dating (but only useful up to about 60,000 years ago and thus is practically useless for most fossils).\n\nAnd radiometric dating is just one of *many* forms of dating fossils and rocks.\n\nBesides radiometric dating, other methods are dendrochronology (matching tree rings in wooden artifacts), paleomagnetic dating (the reversals in the earth's magnetic field), ice cores, varves (counting layers of sedimentary deposits), superposition, stratigraphy, etc. etc.  All of these are good for dating overlapping time ranges ... and where the ranges overlap they confirm and calibrate each other.  (My first link under Sources gives a great overview of many of these different methods.)\n\nCarbon dating is used for dating once-living tissue like bones or wood (*not* fossils) and is very accurate, but only to about 50,000 to 60,000 years ago ... much younger than most fossils.  Why?  Because carbon-14 decays with a very short half-life of only 5,730 years (which is why it is so accurate).  For dating older artifacts like fossils, we use isotopes of radioactive materials that decay with a much longer half-life.  Each technique is named after an atom that decays at a known rate (half-life) into another atom.  For example, potassium-argon dating measures the decay of potassium-40 to argon-40 with a half life of 1.26 *billion* years.  There are literally dozens of other methods, and again, because they overlap, they all confirm and calibrate each other."

You should find out yourself, because no one else can answer this for you and just accept yourself for whatever you are.

Keep on fantasizing if you like it.  You may find that you are a female trapped in a man's body.  There's no way to tell.  The reason for all the confusion is because you're telling yourself that you need to be a certain way, which is rubbish.  Thinking you need to be a certain way is purely influence and it's not natural.  We are what we are, and the only way to be wrong in what you are is living a lie.  Find the truth, and love it because the truth is beautiful, no matter what the truth is.  The truth will set you free.  This may be a cliche, but it's true.  \n\nKnow this;  Most things you believe to be a necessity, you find later to be unnecessary.

The term is a geographic construct, not an actual physical phenomenon, and is of interest mostly to explorers and conspiracy theorists.\n\nNorthern Pole of Inaccessibility (84°03′N 174°51′W). Located on the Arctic Ocean pack ice at a distance farthest from any land mass. It is 661 km (411 statute miles) from the North Pole, 1453 km (903 mi) north of Barrow, Alaska, and equidistant from the closest landmasses, Ellesmere Island and Franz-Josef Land, 1094 km (680 mi) away. It was reached by Sir Hubert Wilkins in 1927 by aircraft. Due to the constant motion of the pack ice, no permanent structure exists at the pole. \nSouthern Pole of Inaccessibility (85°50′S 65°47′E). A spot on Antarctica at a point most distant from the surrounding ocean. It is located 463 km (288 statute miles) from the South Pole. The surface elevation is 3718 m (12,198 ft). It was reached in 1957 by a Soviet Antarctic Expedition for International Geophysical Year research work: see Pole of inaccessibility (Antarctic research station). Today a building still remains at this site, marked by a statue of Vladimir Lenin, and is protected as a historical site. Note that there are several possible definitions [1], depending on whether the ""coast"" is measured to the grounding line, or to the ice shelves. \nPacific Pole of Inaccessibility, also called Point Nemo (48°50′S 123°20′W) is the place in the ocean that is farthest from land. It lies in the South Pacific Ocean, 2688 km (1670 mi or 1451 NM) from the nearest lands: Ducie Island (part of the Pitcairn Islands) in the north, Motu Nui (part of the Easter Islands) in the north-east, and Maher Island (off the coast of Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica) in the south. Chatham Island lies further west, and Southern Chile in the east. \nEurasian Pole of Inaccessibility (46°17′N 86°40′E) the place on land that is farthest from the ocean. It lies in northern China and is 2645 km (1645 mi) from the nearest coastline. It is located approximately 320 km (200 mi) from the city of Ürümqi, in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, in the Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert. The precise geographical point was reached on 27 June 1986 by Nicholas Crane and Dr Richard Crane. \nCoincidentally, the Eurasian and the Pacific poles have approximately the same radius"

"1","why do people celebrate Christmas if its not even mention in the bible?","","THE ORIGIN OF CHRISTMAS\n\nIt was not until several hundred years after Jesus lived on the earth that people began to commemorate his birth on December 25. But that was not the date of Jesus’ birth.\n\nConsider the weather conditions at that time of the year in Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The Jewish month of Chislev (corresponding to November/December) was a month with cold and rainy weather. The month after that was Tebeth (December/January). It saw the lowest temperatures of the year, with occasional snows in the highlands. Let us see what the Bible tells us about the climate of that region.\nThe Bible writer Ezra shows that Chislev was indeed a month known for cold and rainy weather. After stating that a crowd had gathered in Jerusalem “in the ninth month [Chislev] on the twentieth day of the month,” Ezra reports that people were “shivering . . . on account of the showers of rain.” Concerning weather conditions at that time of the year, the congregated people themselves said: “It is the season of showers of rain, and it is not possible to stand outside.” (Ezra 10:9, 13; Jeremiah 36:22) No wonder shepherds living in that part of the world made sure that they and their flocks were no longer out of doors at night when December came around!\nThe Bible reports, however, that shepherds were in the fields tending their flocks on the night of Jesus’ birth. In fact, the Bible writer Luke shows that at that time, shepherds were “living out of doors and keeping watches in the night over their flocks” near Bethlehem. (Luke 2:8-12) Notice that the shepherds were actually living out of doors, not just strolling outside during the day. They had their flocks in the fields at night. Does that description of outdoor living fit the chilly and rainy weather conditions of Bethlehem in December? No, it does not. So the circumstances surrounding Jesus’ birth indicate that he was not born in December.\n\nSo why was December 25 chosen? Some who later claimed to be Christian likely “wished the date to coincide with the pagan Roman festival marking the ‘birthday of the unconquered sun.’” (The New Encyclopædia Britannica) In winter, when the sun seemed weakest, pagans held ceremonies to get this source of warmth and light to come back from its distant travels. December 25 was thought to be the day that the sun began its return. In an effort to convert pagans, religious leaders adopted this festival and tried to make it seem “Christian.”\n\nThe pagan roots of Christmas have long been recognized. Because of its unscriptural origin, Christmas was banned in England and in some of the American colonies during the 17th century. Anyone who even stayed home from work on Christmas day had to pay a penalty. Soon, though, the old customs were back, and some new ones were added. Christmas once again became a big holiday, and that is what it still is in many lands. Because of the connections that Christmas has with false religion, however, those who want to please God do not celebrate it or any other holiday that has its roots in pagan worship.\n\nhttp://www.watchtower.org/library/w/2000/12/15/article_01.htm\n\n\n."
"1","Why do people move to the west, but hate freedoms and modernity?","","I think it's weird too. I think they move because they know that the west is a better place to live, more money, better healthcare, better education, and tolerant of religious diversity.\n\nBut some of them, when they arrive, they complain about how immoral it is and how it conflicts with their religious ideals and corrupts their children. \n\nIt's all part of the same package, if you don't want to be 'tainted' by our immorality or have your children growing up in our culture, you shouldn't move here. If you move to another country you should be respectful of their culture. If you don't agree with it don't go."

An of course the food is excellent!  I have been travelling though Indonesia for two months and I had a great time. I went to Java, where I visited Jakarta, a very busy city with a rich history. I also went to Bandung, where you can buy custom made jeans, really great! Yogjakarta is a beautiful town as well, with a lot of culture, really the cultural capital of Java! I also visited Bali. Bali is partly very touristic, for example the beach resorts Kuta, Sanur of Jimbaran. However, I loved the seafood in Jimbaran and had a great time in Kuta. I also enjoyed my time in Ubud, an artistic village in the middle of rice fields on Bali. Beautiful sights and I was fascinated by the Balinese culture and their religion, Hinduism. The Gili islands are great for diving and snorkeling. For peace and quiet, visit Gili Meno or Gili Air, if you want some more action, Gili Trawangan is maybe more for you. Anyway, all three islands look like real Bounty islands and you feel as if you are in the add...\nI would recommend everyone to visit Flores. What a beautiful island, with not that much tourism yet. People are very friendly, nature is breathtaking (for example watching the sunrise on the Kelimutu volcano, a great experience!) and the sights are so interesting.\nI really love Indonesia and find it a very diverse country. I was very sorry to hear about the earthquake and I really hope that Indonesia will have less problems with nature and disasters in the future, it definetly does not deserve it."

"1","Why is it that...?","When I ask ""How would God feel about one person on His planet calling another person on His planet an 'illegal alien' ?"" ...I get a lot of answers that state: He would agree with that, because God wants us to follow to laws of the country...\n\nBut when it's about gay marriage, it's all of a sudden allowed to try to use God's Word to change the laws of the country.\n\nWhy that double standard?","you do understand that being against illegal immigration, and gay marriage is a consistant   stance.  Both are against the laws.  Many state constitutions make sodomy illegal.  This does not make some same sex relations outlawed  but when marriage laws were made it was for a hetero sexual relationship, and not consumated until they had sex.\n\nI disagree about God's position that a person would be somehow illegal.  While He gives us free will to govern and make our own decisions but that does not entail Him agreeing what we do is a good idea.  God did for some reason disperse us and have different languages given to us.  He never how ever made us draw lines in the sand and say this is mine stay out.  \n\nSomething you might find interesting is the study of linguistics.  They have found there are over 7 core languages which would not be true if man had developed along the lines proposed by evolutionary types of progress. It is evidence that either there were over 7 iniyial groups or there was some type of Tower of Babel type incident in our past.  Certainly there maybe explanations we have not yet thought of,  but it is another one of those discoverys which back the Biblical account,  though not proof.\n\nMany of God's rules had to do with stopping diseases from spreading.  Paul it is my opinion calls attention to the prostititis desease associated with anal sex.  There are others.  So far other than using Biblical guidance we have not found a way to stop STDS.\n\nI have no Biblical direction on Illegal immigration other than to call attention to the fact that If we just limited any persons income to say 1000 times the lowest income then borders would not be a problem for labor.  Jesus did point out it is wrong to accumulate as capitalists seem to think it is their God given right to do.\n\nNo way should any person be allowed to accumulate so much wealth that the only thing left for them to buy is power.   If this were the rule (limited income) then the whole immegration problem as well as many other problems would disappear.  Therefor God has expressed a directive (2 actually including no charging interest) which has to do with immigration and if it were not ignored we would not be having this problem\n\nso do what God says and decrease desease and increase fair distribution.\n\nHe just has this knack for bringing these things back to the basics.\nwhose picture is on this coin??\ntoo tired to be coherant\nyeah Dems. boo bush"

"2","How can gravity be explained in a simple nutshell?","I am pretty intelligent, but I have a hard time understanding how and why gravity exists.","As mentioned in other replies, physicists don't yet have all of the ""how"" questions answered. Einstein, in the General Theory of Relativity, pretty much nailed the underpinnings of the current theoretical understanding of gravity. Here is my attempt at the ""nutshell."" I'll start with an analogy. Let's say you are driving somewhere in the midwest or plains states--essentially flat ground, with a few rolling hills. Let's say you stop your car at the top of a slight rise. As you look around you, you see flat land in every direction. You're sitting on essentially a two-dimensional plane. Taking your foot off the brake, you notice the car starting to roll forward. Your initial observation about the 2-dimensional ""space"" you were sitting on isn't quite accurate. The 3rd dimension (altitude) has come into play, and gravity is pulling your car into the swale. What Einstein said (and how he came up with this back in the early 1900's is incredible) was that our THREE dimensions are really a slightly inaccurate description of the world (and universe) we inhabit. A fourth dimension, time, is part of the ""fabric"" of our surroundings. As in the case of that slight ""warp"" in the 2-dimensional farmland that led to a noticeable effect on your car, Einstein said that warps in the space-time continuum are experienced as gravity. As you know, Einstein was into the ""energy = mass"" thing big time, and you know that mass is tied up with gravity as well. If you want to get more cozy with these related concepts, I strongly recommend David Bodanis' book, ""E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation"" -- available as a ""BooksOnTape."" It's exciting, full of cool anecdotes about the heroes of 20th century physics, and... NO MATH, just concepts. Best of luck!"

"2","what is the molecular formula for ethanol?","","C2H5OH\n\nThe end (-anol) tells you it's an alcohol, which means it has an OH group somewhere.  The begining (eth-) is the prefix used in organic chemistry to mean two, which tells you there are two carbons.  The two carbons are bonded to each other (that's just how alcohols work, because of the electronegativities of the atoms), and each one can bond to three other things.  If it were an alkane (the simple ones that are just a carbon chain surrounded by the maximum possible hydrogen atoms), it would be two carbons with six hydrogens around it (which is called ethane), but since it's an alcohol, there has to be an OH group somewhere, which is added basically by sticking an oxygen between one of the carbon-hydrogen bonds in the alkane.  That leaves you with two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom, giving a molecular forumla of C2H6O.  But because the OH is basically one thing, it's generally written like that is a single atom, so the molecular forumla for ethanol is given as C2H5OH."

We have several more 'dwarf planets.'  \n\nThe difference is that, during planet formation, a planet's gravity will pull in all the material around it, leaving a planet surrounded \nby empty space.  This is referred to as 'clearing the neighborhood.'  A dwarf planet's gravity is not sufficient to pull in all the material around it, so it does not clear its neighborhood.  \n\nPluto is now a dwarf planet, along with several asteroids and other celestial bodies.  In fact, Pluto is a binary planet, because it and it's moon, Charon, orbit each other (the center of Charon's orbit is not a point inside of Pluto, but rather a point between the two bodies).  So Pluto probably won't even be considered a dwarf planet for long.\n\nThis Xena, as you call it, is twice the size of Pluto.  That's what reignited this whole controversy.  It's real name is 2003UB313.  Xena was only given to it as a temporary name."
"2","about HeilongJiang river?","","Heilongjiang River: Situated in the northernmost part of China, it has a drainage area of more than 1.62 million square km.\nNicknamed ""Mysterious Scenic Horizon"", the Heilongjiang is an international river, which meanders its way across Russia, Mongolia and China. The middle section of the 4,370-km-long river marks the boundary between China and Russia. Its water showing a darkish hue, the river looks like a swimming dragon as it flows through a picturesque landscape teeming with local folklore. Cruises on the river begin at Mohe in the north, and pass such places as Xilinji, Heihe, Xunke, and Zhanhe. Daredevils may also go rafting in the river. Mohe is China's northernmost town; also known as North Pole Village, it is where the aurora borealis can be observed during the summer solstice, which falls on June 21 or 22.\n\nAlso:\n\nThe Heilongjiang River, the Sino-Russian boundary river, runs across the northern part of north China. Its headstream includes the northern source and the southern source. The northern source Shilka River originates from the eastern foothills of the Mount Kent in the Outer Mongolia, and the southern source Argun River originates from the western slope of China's Great Hinggan Mountains. After the convergence of the southern source and the northern source at the Xiluoguhe Village, Mohe City, China, the river is called as the Heilongjiang River that runs eastwardly and finally empties into the Sea of Okhotsk. The Heilongjiang River flows across China, Russia and the Outer Mongolia. Its entire length is 4,370 kilometers, the 11th largest river in the world. Its drainage area is up to 1,843,000 square kilometers, ranking the 10th largest in the world. The drainage area within China accounts for 48% of the total drainage area.   \nThe Heilongjiang River was known as the Yushui, Wanshui and Heishui in ancient China. The forests are luxuriant and the aquatic grasses are verdant wherever the Heilongjiang River flows across. The rich black humus in the soil is carried into the river by the surface water and the river water therefore becomes livid. The Manchu people living in the Heilongjiang River Valley call the river Sahalianwula, the Sahalian means the black color, and the Wula means the river. The name of the Heilongjiang River (river in the shape of a black dragon) was thus formed. Therefore, it is lively and visual to name the slightly black river that looks like a black swimming dragon as the Heilongjiang River.\nThe Heilongjiang River has total 200 more tributaries in which the large ones include the Songari River, the Wusuli River, the Zeya River and the Bulieya River."
"2","Why does water have a current?","this is from my anatomy homework","Hmmm...\n\nIn order to clarify any possible ambiguities, I will attempt to answer this question from 2 very different perspectives.\n\nGiven this came from your anatomy homework:  Water carries a current because H2O readily dissociates into H+ and OH- ions.  The charged ions make water a good electron carrier, and therefore, a good conductor for current.\n\nIn case this came from another science class: Water carries a current because it is subject to physical forces such as atmospheric phenomenae, namely wind, the gravitic pull of the moon (the source of tides), the spinning of the earth, the creatures which inhabit it.... and basically anything which causes water to move.  All these forces sum up to give water the various currents we see in different parts of the world."

"2","waterhammer in pipes?","(1)what is water hammer\n(2)where does it occur (10 points)\n(3)how do you neutralise it(10 points)","You have some very good answers here but I can add a little more.  Consider a pipe to be elastic (true!) but imagine that it is made of rubber.  Consider water to be nearly incompressible (a cubic inch of water at the bottom of the 7 mile deep Mariana trench still measures nearly a cubic inch).  Water can possess energy in two ways (neglecting heat); pressure energy or velocity energy and can easily convert back and forth.  When you extinguish velocity of a slug (or stream) of water you produce pressure and the pressure when relaxed can produce velocity.  This can go on and on until the energy is dissipated for example by friction.\n\nWhen a stream of water is flowing along an elastic pipe (think rubber) and you suddenly trip shut a guillotine valve (very fast acting) the velocity of the column of water is instantly extinguished and converted to pressure which starts as a shock wave stretching the rubber pipe toward the upstream end perhaps until it reaches the vessel supplying the water.  But the stream is then reversed as the rubber pipe relaxes squeezing out the water toward the vessel and continues until the rubber pipe is under a partial vacuum and shrinks.  In an ideal system (no friction), pressure waves would continue the travel back and forth along the pipe converting pressure to velocity and back to presure as the pipe expands and contracts under the changing pressure.  They call it water hammer because it actually can sound like someone hitting the pipe with a hammer.  Actually the pipe expands suddenly sending off a sound wave through the air.\n\nWater hammer can be avoided several ways.  For example if the pipe also contains air bubbles (accidently or on purpose) the bubbles will absorb any hydraulic shock wave preventing the elastic pipe from expanding and the bubbles re-expand slowly, slowing down the entire procedure.  The plumbing leading to many sinks in homes has a small ""empty"" vertical section near the sink to hold an air bubble which avoids a water hammer if the sink faucet is shut too fast.  It is sometimes necessary to drain the system with valves open to refill the air trap with air if it gets waterlogged.\n\nWater hammer can be avoided by shutting valves slowly rather than instantly.  Water hammer can occur in a pipe filled with steam because steam is easily compressed compared to an air bubble and a slug of water can be accelerated along a pipe by condensing steam until it ""strikes"" the end of the run and converts velocity to over-pressure.  I once got a frantic call at home (3 AM?) from a power plant under construction.  While testing a large pipe run for the first time under steam, the long say 12-inch pipe began to jump around threatening to break its pipe hangers and making a terrific racket.  Almost without waking up I told them to crack open any lowpoint valves or fittings to drain off all condensation and the pipe went back to sleep too.  In the finished plant there were automatic condensation drain valves to avoid water hammer which could damage the steam turbines too, etc."

The simple fact is that it is quite common in the Bible for human beings to be given names that have the purpose of declaring or reflecting a particular attribute of God, e.g., Eliab, Eliada, Elzaphan, Eliakim, Elisha, Eleazar, Tavel, Gedaliah.\n\nIn Isaiah 7:14 the Hebrew states ""hinei ha'almah harah veyoledet ben"" ""behold (hineih) the young woman (ha - the almah- young woman) is pregnant (harah) and shall give birth (ve-and yoledet-shall give birth) to a son (ben)"". The Christians translate this as ""behold a virgin shall give birth."" They have made two mistakes (probably deliberate) in the one verse. They mistranslate ""ha"" as ""a"" instead of ""the"". They mistranslate ""almah"" as ""virgin"", when in fact the Hebrew word for virgin is ""betulah"".

"2","our epithelial tissue lacks blood supply and derives nutrition from the basement memrane.?","then why do we bleed when we prick our skin????","The skin is composed of two main layers: the outer epidermis and the inner dermis.The epidermis is epithelial tissue and is avascular, meaning that it does not have any blood vessels,therefore no blood supply. However, the dermis which is underneath the epidermis and part of the skin is vascular. It contains blood vessels, therefore blood supply. So, when the cut is superficial and goes only through the epidermis, thee is no bleeding. But if it is a deeper cut reaching the dermis, we will of course bleed because of the presence  of blood vessels in this region of the skin."

They are not just names of the same God.They can co-exist at the same time and yet they are one. Taking this definition, It is actually not a mystery. The key to unsolving this mystery is understanding ""one"". The one is not the numerical number one. Below are the 2 definitions of one.\n\nA) Yachead – Absolute unity; the numerical number one\n– Abraham offered up his only (Yachead) son (Genesis 22:2,12)\n– They shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only (Yachead) son (Zechariah 12:10)\n\nB) Echad – A collective unity; more than one person, one crowd, one nation etc.\n–People gathered together as one (Echad) (Ezra 3:1)\n–The Lord or God is one (Echad) God (Deuteronomy 6:4)\n–In that day, there shall be one (Echad) Lord and His Name one (Echad) (Zechariah 14:9)\n\nFor example there is one nation, but in it there is many distinct different persons.

They can co_exist at the same time. \n\nNow for the sake of study, Christians have seperated the father, the son and the holy spirit, to be able to learn about each individual in a more comprehensive manner.\n\nBut the truth is they are always together and they are inseperable.\n\nso all these to say that \na) God is one in operation but 3 in revelation\nb) The three are distinguishable but indivisible\n\nHope this helps"

"2","define  fraction crystallization?","chemistry","Fractional crystallization is occurs when a solid crystallizes from a liquid, and the solid has a different composition from the liquid.  Crystallization of single salt, such as sodium chloride (NaCl, or table salt) from an aqueous solution of NaCl is a trivial example of fractional crystallization.  More commonly the term refers to a situation in which more than one substance is dissolved in a solvent.  In this case, they will crystallize out of solution (precipitate) at different rates, and this provides a means of separating substances based on their different solubilities (e.g., in the trivial example of NaCl dissolved in water, one is, in fact, separating NaCl from H2O when the NaCl crystallizes).  Crystallization can be induced by changes in concentration, temperature, pressure, etc.\n\nI'm a geologist, and to geologists, fractional crystallization usually refers to crystallization crystallization and segregation of crystals from a magma (molten silicate rock) such that they do not remain in chemical ""communication"" with the remaing melt (i.e., they cannot remain in chemical equilibrium with the melt). This process is responsible for much of chemical variation seen in igneous rocks."

"2","enzymatic structure?","what is it?","The function of all proteins is determined by its three-dimensional structure. This fact is never more critical than in the class of proteins called enzymes.\n\nEnzymes are little nano machines that have very specific jobs. These machines are only able to do their jobs on very specific molecules called substrates. The specificity of an enzyme to its substrate(s) is provided for by the fact that the substrate(s) fit into an area on the enzyme called the active site. The best analogy for picturing what an active site is like is the key and lock model. Think about all the different locks that accept keys in the world and how only specific keys work in individual locks. That's how enzymes and substrates are. There are a lot of enzymes in the world, just like there are a lot of keys in the world, but only specific keys will work in a specific lock, just like only spcific enzymes will work on a specific substrate(s). \n\nAny way, it's the shape of the acitve site that allows it to recognize and catalyze it's specific substrate into its eventual product -- that's the end result of the reaction the enzyme is helping along to completion. However, there are other important aspects to an enzyme's structure that also important. The active site is ucually arranged in such a way that two or three amino acids are positioned a three-dimensial configuration that will allow them to carry out the specific chemical reaction(s) that take place (I'm talking about either a substitution reaction, redox reaction, condensation reaction, etc.). These two or three amino acids are many times found in various positions along the sequence of the amino acid sequence. And the only way these active site amino acids are able to be placed in close proximity in the active site is by the secondary and tertiary structural configurations.\n\nSo, it's obvious, if you were to remove or replace any of the amino acids specific to the active site, you would in essence deactivate the enzyme. However, there are other ways of deactivating the enzyme. If you were to change/remove any other amino acid that was critical to the structural integrity of the whole protein, causing the protein to change its shape and thus shifting the location of the active site amino acide so that they couldn't complete their reactions, you have also effectively deactivated the protein.\n\nUsually the later change is easier to fix by some compensatory change that restores the activity of the enzyme than it is to restore activity of the former change."

Since the ions doenst slow down\nthe melting of ice, but slows down the freeze of water.\nThe ice now melts at below 0 degree.\n\nSo a normal ice water will be at zero degree.\nBut a salt put on the ice/water will melt more of the ice at a lower temp., about 7-10 degree colder, depenting on the ammount of salt and ice avalibale."

"2","define function?","","In mathematics, a function relates each of its inputs to exactly one output. A standard notation for the output of the function f with the input x is f(x). The set of all inputs which a function accepts is called the domain of the function. The set of all outputs is called the range.\n\nFor example, the expression f(x) = x2 describes a function, f, that relates each input, x, with one output, x2. Thus, an input of 3 is related to an output of 9. Once a function, f, has been defined we can write, for example, f(4) = 16.\n\nIt is a usual practice in mathematics to introduce functions with temporary names like f; in the next paragraph we might define f(x) = 2x+1, and then f(4) = 9. When a name for the function is not needed, often the form y=x2 is used."

"2","Do you think that the world will eventually have hover cars and teleporters?","Will the world have hover cars and teleporters?","there already are hover cars (just not yet in production).\nas for teleportation, i suppose it is not yet possible. think about it, existence is like a 4 dimensional coordinate system where the 3 dimensions (x,y,z) are dependent on the 4th coordinate, which is time. Right now, if we follow this 4d coordinate system, the whole function of existence would be continuous. The introduction of teleportation in this scenarion would cause the function of existence to be discontinuous, which would be very hard to explain. Put simply, it is really hard to drastically change the (x,y,z) coordinates as the time it takes for the change approaches zero (teleportation)."
"2","Which is the most flexible joint in our body??","","The joint with the greatest degree of freedom in rotation and angles achievable would probably be the shoulder joint where the humerus connects to the scapula in the glenoid fossa.\n\nThe degree of motion in this joint is remarkable, and is probably a legacy of the brachiation ability of our ape forebears.\n\nThe flexibility of this joint also probably costs us too, as it is probably one of the most easily injured joints.  Dislocated shoulders and torn rotator cuffs are probably a result of this flexibility, as the joint is not well protected with connective tissue, large slabs of muscle or shelves of bone."

Idolatry?","I think it doesn't really matter if the cross was in fact a cross, or if it was an execution stake. We know that both His hands and feet were nailed to it. In regard to this it would make sense that the actual execution stake had the shape of a cross.\nChristians have made the cross into something it was never meant to be. They have also abused it for centuries. It's not the cross as such, but rather what happened there that was meant to become symbolic.\nI do not believe that the cross is the sign of the antichrist even though, to many Jews it would certainly seem like it!"
"2","I have an Electronics PCB project and i have problem with the capacitors...?","I have some ceramic capacitors and some electrolytic capacitors. I want to ask whether i can use the electrolytics with the DC voltage. I will feed my circuit with 6, 12, -12v and I want to ask if the polarity of the electrolytics change, will the capacitors burn or go out? If you can help me, I will be very happy...\nThanks...","You cannot run polarized electrolytics backwards, without destroying them. You can find dozens of different non-polarized types on-line from parts distributors such as Mouser, Allied, and Digi-Key. But if you want to get around the problem, there's still another way; Place two standard polarized electrolytics in series, ""back-to-back"" so that their negative terminals are connected to each other. Then, place a rectifier diode, such as a 1N4002, in parallel with each capacitor, so that the cathodes are in contact with the positive capacitor terminals, and the anodes are in contact with the negative capacitor terminals.  What you will have now made is a ""bipolar"" or ""non-polarized"" capacitor that is roughly equivalent in value to one of the two original polarized capacitors!  If, for example, both of the electrolytics were rated at, say 2200 MFD @ 25 VDC, the new ""homebrew"" NP capacitor will function as a 2000 MFD, 25VAC capacitor!  Reversing polarity on this ""home brew"" capacitor will not cause any problems, whatsoever!"

The question reads ""Give the major product and justify which reaction mechanism is favored for each reaction."" I've pretty much gotten the answer (which is due to elimination because of the hindered nucleophile), but I'm still confused about the protic solvent. Does it affect whether the reaction is substitution or elimination? Thank you very much.","Protic solvent help stabilizes carbocation intermediate, hence promotes either SN1 or E1. It has nothing to do with preference in elimination or substitution.\nA protic solvent also help solvate anionic nucleophile, reducing its nucleophilicity. \nIn this case, it is true that your reaction will be an elimination, as t-Bu-O- (tertiary butoxide) always results in elimination, even with primary alkyl halides. Its nucleophilicity is lowered, but it is still a strong base. However, primary alkyl halides do not form carbocation. Instead of E1, they will undergo E2, in spite of the protic solvent. \nIndeed, E1 in alkyl halides usually lose in competition with SN1. E1 is important in alcohol reactions."

"1","What was the common unit of currency in the Old Testament?","","The Hebrews probably first used coins in the Persian period (500-350 B.C.). However, minting began around 700 B.C. in other nations. Prior to this precious metals were weighed, not counted as money.\n\nSome units appear as both measures of money and measures of weights. This comes from naming the coins after their weight. For example, the shekel was a weight long before it became a coin.\n\nIt is helpful to relate biblical monies to current values. But we cannot make exact equivalents. The fluctuating value of money's purchasing power is difficult to determine in our own day. It is even harder to evaluate currencies used two- to three thousand years ago.  Have a look at the chart on the website pasted below."

"2","does heat flow from hot to cold or from cold to hot?","","As my college chemistry professor said:\n\nOn a warm day, ther-mo-dy-nam-ics tells you that your cold beer is not going to get colder, it's going to get warmer so you better drink it sooner rather than later.\n\nThus, heat flows from hot to cold, not cold to hot.\n\nAnother way to look at it this.  Cold is not the presense of something, it is the absense of something.  It is the absense of thermal energy.  At absolute 0, there is now thermal energy in the system.  While placing something hot in the system will make the hot thing colder, it is because the thermal energy is migrating from the hot thing to warm up the cold surroundings."

"2","tell me about MSA?","","Well, since you asked this under medical, I will assume you mean MSA acrnym for:\n Multisystem atrophy (MSA) is a group of rare, multisystem degenerative diseases that have several clinical features of Parkinson�s and are sometimes referred to as the ""Parkinsonism-plus syndromes."" When MSA was first identified in 1960 it was named ""Shy-Drager Syndrome"" after the two physicians who first described its symptoms. Now, Shy-Drager Syndrome is recognized as only one of three manifestations of multisystem atrophy. The other two are Striatonigral Degeneration and Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy (OPCA). The three are lumped together as MSA because of their clinical overlap and neuroanatomical similiarities.\n\nMultisystem atrophy has three cardinal features:\n\n    * Parkinsonism (see Parkinson�s)\n    * Autonomic failure (including orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence or retention)\n    * Cerebellar ataxia (failure of muscular coordination) \n\nMy grandmother has Shy-Drager, is 85 years old.  Also has dementia, it may come with it, no one really knows for sue.  It also usually comes with depression, annoying behaviors, or is that just my grandma?\n\nI hope you don't have it.\n\nJust a note:  If a person has Shy Drager there are tricks with the dizziness problem.  WHen the dizziness starts get to a chair.  Drink caffiene, high salt items like popcorn or slaty boullion.  THis remedies it fast.  There are pills for the blood pressure (to keep it up) but they have side effects."

"2","do batteries weigh less when they are exhausted than when they are fully charged?","","I think that the answer must be YES.\n\nLet's assume that  these are dry cell batteries (so they are not losing any matter by evaoporation or gaining any by using oxygen in the atmosphere.\n\nSo no particles get in or out of the battery.  However, the battery, once spent, has lost some energy (perhaps by powering a torch which then gives out light and heat energy).\n\nAccording to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2.  So this amount of energy must be equivalent to (an extremely small) quantity of matter and the mass of the battery must have reduced by this amount.  It will not be measurable in ordinary circumstances and I am sure that other factors (eg dust particles settling on it, etc) would FAR outweigh this mass of the released energy.  But theoretically, yes, it would weigh less.\n\nOne gets a similar kind of balance in radioactive decay; a uranium nucleus decays into some other bits and pieces but the mass of the other bits and pieces is slightly less than the mass of the original uranium nucleus in order to account for the energy that is released (in the form of EM radiation).\n\nHope this makes sense."

When it split up to drift into present locations it was probably pure coincidence why pointy parts of land masses pointed one way rather than another.  My pet theory is that luna tides (that affect the oceans and earth's crust) may have biased the direction of ""cracks"" in the land masses, but perhaps I'm just a luna-tick.  Incidentally the term lunatic originally applied to scientists who met once a month when they could travel at night with the aid of the light of a full moon."

Oh!! How Terrible!!\n\nThey call a normal man like You and Me (the Pope) as the Representative of Jesus and ask him to forgive their sins.\n\nTo go on writing this page is not enough.","I would like to comment on the fact about Mary or the other saints being worship.

So in this example, x = 17 from the first one, and x = -11 from the second one.\n\nBecause of the absolute value, expect to have double the usual amount of answers.  In other words, for a linear equation, normally you'd expect to have one answer.  If it's a linear absolute value, you'll have at most 2 (this doesn't mean you'll always have 2 - you might have 2 0's for an answer, as in |x/15| = 0).  A quadratic yields at most 2 answers, but a quadratic absolute will yield at most 4."

"2","What makes the north pole of the earth static?","","There are three types of North to consider.\n\nMagnetic north is determined by the Earth's magnetic field. This point moves considerably wandering in an eliptical path on a daily basis, and moves even more over a period of decades. On average it moves 10 km per year. Because of this all maps require a correction to be made for the reading of a compass in order to match the map. This is known as declination, also called magnetic declination. Declination also varies according to variations in the Earth's magnetic field in different geographic areas.  In order to use a magnetic compass to navigate with a map you must know your local declination value. \n\nTrue north is determined by the celestial North pole, which is the term used by navigators for the position of the star Polaris. This point will only be useful for about another thousand years because of the precession of the Earth during its orbit. Precession could be described as a wobble in the Earth's axis of rotation. \n\nCelestial north, or grid north is the point where the earth's spin axis hypothetically extends through the earth. Relative to our position on the planet this does not change because it is essentially an arbitrary point decided on by cartographers. However it is not consistent from one geographic coordinate system to another. This is because a globe is the only way to accurately represent all points on the earth and a map using any two dimensional coordinate system will have errors in some part of the map."

Subtracting the earth radius from that gives\n\n1.8204521E7, or about 18 million km.\n\nIf you're considering a point that stays directly above the earth as it rotates, the nswer depends on the latitude and is the solution of a cubic equation.

"2","Radiology Techs are making six figures?","My brother-in-law was complaining last month, it seems his practice out in CO lost their radiology tech to someone else, he was offered a crazy salary.

He also took extra shifts across the Bay in Oakland for $50/hour. He explained to me that ultrasound techs make much more.

Religion explains the unexplainable to us.  So, if we can understand things now that we couldn't understand before will we eventually not have a need for religion?  Is it possible that these belief systems are now failing?  If so, do you think we should replace it with another, or leave organization out of belief?","I'm not sure that you're correct that we actually understand more now than we did before.  It is still a common assumption that we only use 10% of our brains.  What would we know if we were able to use the other 90%?  We still have no idea what really exists outside of our immediate environment, however far that goes into space, we can only assume that we've only scratched the surface.  Despite all the things that we can create, we cannot get close to re-creating a telescopic lens as diverse as the human eye, nor can we create a shock absorbing device nearly as complex as the knee.  Yes, we are making incredible progress in certain areas, but we will never know everything.  Secondly, my relationship with Christ is not a result of me wanting to understand the world in which I live.  It is a result of a desire to be with the one who created me.  So, to answer your question, some religions may fail, they will be proven useless.  However, a relationship with Christ will never be unnecessary."
"2","what are glycerol used in the human body for?","","HELLO Amina,\nGlycerols are actually a sort of derived lipids obtained by hydrolysis of fats with water at high temperatures and pressures. it is in fact a trihydroxy alcohol, which is sweet and viscous. It forms esters like Triacyl glycerols(TGs) or Diacyl Glucerols or Monoacyl Glycerols  (or otherwise called Tri Glycerides) with fatty acids and phosphates. TGs are neutral fats, which, like cholesterol form the fat content of the body. These TGs get oxidized inside the mitochondria of cells  in the absence  (or scarcity) of glucose and act as a source of energy during starvation or dieting. Glycerol esters of higher fatty acids remain solid in room temperature and examples of such TGs include various vegetable oils. \nFatty acid esters with phosphate groups(PO4=) can form phosphoglycerides when they contain glycerol as the alcohol. Such compounds are important as protectors of the nervous tissue. Egs include phosphatidyl choline, and Lecithin. The last one is also present in Heart and liver..\nOoohhh that was a pretty long answer. \nHope I didn't get too technical and i suppose iwas clear on the topic,\nSo long then.."

Each acetate contains two carbon, two oxygen and four hydrogen.  So in total, you have: 1 Al, 6 C, 12 H, 6 O.\n\nBecause you state that you have one mole of that aluminium acetate, this means that you have 1 mole of Al, 6 moles of C, 12 moles of H, 6 moles of O, so 25 moles of atoms total.\n\nIf you had more salt, lets say 4,8 moles of Al(CH3COOH)3, then you would have to multiply everything by 4,8."

Was the cross Jesus was crucified on made of dogwood?""\n\nThe Bible does not tell us what type of wood the cross Jesus was crucified on was made of. Roman history does not go into specifics as to how the crosses were made or what type of wood they were made of. As a result, we cannot know for sure what type of tree was used to make the cross. There is a legend that it was made of dogwood. This is unlikely considering the typical size of a dogwood tree. The legend of the dogwood tree, author unknown, is as follows:\n\nIn Jesus' time, the dogwood grew\nTo a stately size and a lovely hue.\n\n'Twas strong & firm it's branches interwoven\nFor the cross of Christ its timbers were chosen.\n\nSeeing the distress at this use of their wood\nChrist made a promise which still holds good:\n\n""Never again shall the dogwood grow\nLarge enough to be used so\n\nSlender & twisted, it shall be\nWith blossoms like the cross for all to see.\n\nAs blood stains the petals marked in brown\nThe blossom's center wears a thorny crown.\n\nAll who see it will remember me\nCrucified on a cross from the dogwood tree.\n\nCherished and protected this tree shall be\nA reminder to all of my agony.""\n\nAgain, this is just a ""legend.""

"2","How do sea clams reproduce?","","Agree with the above. Additional points - the fertilized egg, or zygote, begins to divide, just as in other animal species, still floating freely in the water.  It eventually develops into a ciliated, free-swimming larva called a veliger. The larva swims about in the water, many of them being eaten by small predators like copepods, and filter-feeding organisms. Eventually, those larvae which survive begin to develop the organs of a mature clam, including a mantle, the shell-producing organ.  The mantle then begins to extract minerals, especially calcium, from the ocean water and starts to form the shell.  The weight of the tiny shell carries the young clam to the bottom, where it continues to grow, if it lands on suitable substrate.  However, if the species is a rock-dweller, like marine mussels, and lands on a muddy or sandy bottom, it dies.  Likewise if the larva of a sand-dwelling clam lands on a hard rock bottom, it dies."

"2","Math Prob.?","Fifteen different farmers each had their own apple orchards. The first farmer had only one apple tree in his orchard, the second farmer had two trees in his orchard, and so on up to fifteen trees for the fifteenth farmer. \n\nAt harvest time, each farmer noticed something very peculiar: each tree in the same orchard produced the exact same number of apples. (Note that the number of apples per tree varied from orchard to orchard) And when all fifteen farmers got together to talk about it, they all realized that, if the farmer with eleven trees had given one apple to the farmer with seven trees, and the farmer with fourteen trees had given three apples each to the farmer with nine trees and the farmer with thirteen trees, they'd all end up with the exact same number of apples!\n\nHow many apples did the farmers produce in total?\n(Without Working)","The number of apples produced by each farmer MUST be a common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15. \n\n1=1\n2=2\n3=3\n4=2x2\n5=5\n8=2x2x2\n10=2x5\n12=2x2x3\n15=3x5\n\nLCM = 1x2x2x2x3x5\nLCM = 120\n\nThe smallest such multiple is 120. \n\nFor the other orchards (7, 9, 11, 13, 14) the various apple giveaways result in numbers that are evenly divisible.\n120 / 7 = 17 r. 1 (Needs one more)\n120 / 9 = 13 r. 3 (Needs three more)\n121 / 11 = 11 (Gives one away)\n120 / 13 = 9 r. 3 (Needs three more)\n126 / 14 = 9 (Gives six away)\n\nTherefore, each farmer produced an average of 120 apples. That means that, in total, all of the farmers produced 15 X 120 apples, or 1,800 apples.\n\nFor completeness:\nOrchard 1: 1 tree, 120 apples\nOrchard 2: 2 trees, 60 apples each (2 x 60 = 120)\nOrchard 3: 3 trees, 40 apples each (3 x 40 = 120)\nOrchard 4: 4 trees, 30 apples each (4 x 30 = 120)\nOrchard 5: 5 trees, 24 apples each (5 x 24 = 120)\nOrchard 6: 6 trees, 20 apples each (6 x 20 = 120)\nOrchard 7: 7 trees, 17 apples each (7 x 17 = 119) +1 (from 11)\nOrchard 8: 8 trees, 15 apples each (8 x 15 = 120)\nOrchard 9: 9 trees, 13 apples each (9 x 13 = 117) +3 (from 14)\nOrchard 10: 10 trees, 12 apples each (10 x 12 = 120)\nOrchard 11: 11 trees, 11 apples each (11 x 11 = 121) -1 (to 7)\nOrchard 12: 12 trees, 10 apples each (12 x 10 = 120)\nOrchard 13: 13 trees, 9 apples each (13 x 9 = 117) +3 (from 14)\nOrchard 14: 14 trees, 9 apples each (14 x 9 = 126) -6 (to 9 & 13)\nOrchard 15: 15 trees, 8 apples each (15 x 8 = 120) \n\nYou don't need to show all this work.  The basic idea is to find the LCM (120) of the orchards that had even batches.  The others will swap to also end up with 120 apples each.  15 x 120 = 1,800 apples."

"2","Why do bubbles form in a glass of tap water?","Why, when you leave a glass of water sitting around for a couple hours or so, do bubbles form it it (as if it were carbonated)?","For starters, these bubbles are not coming from the oxygen present in H2O, or any transition from gas to liquid state. The amount of activation energy it would take to break the H2O bond (plus the surrounding hydrogen bonds) to send liquid Oxygen to gas form is not going to come from room temperature. More likely, the gas bubbles you see are dissolved air. Your water has gone through many filtration stops and a multitude of meshes, all of which can dissolve small microscopic bubbles of air in the water. These either come out to the water-air interface or combine with neighboring bubbles (I would guess this reduces surface tension). You see the larger air bubbles."

"1","When did Amish religion originate? Where?","When and where did the Amish group originate? What are some disadvantages of being Amish?","Like the Mennonites, the Amish are descendants of the Swiss Anabaptists (1525). The Swiss Anabaptists, called the ""Swiss Brethren"", had their origins with Felix Manz and Conrad Grebel. The name ""Mennonite"" was applied later and came from Menno Simons (circa 1496–1561), who was an Anabaptist leader in the Rhein Lowlands. Simons was a Dutch Roman Catholic priest who converted to Anabaptism in 1536 and was baptized by Obbe Philips after renouncing his Catholic faith and office. He was a leader in the Lowland Anabaptist communities, but his influence reached gradually into Switzerland.\n\nThe Amish movement takes its name from that of Jacob Amman (c. 1656 – c. 1730), a Swiss Mennonite. Amman felt that the Mennonites were drifting from close adherence to the teachings of Simons and the 1632 Mennonite Dordrecht Confession of Faith. Much of the laxity was in the area of shunning excluded members, also called the ban (or Meidung in Pennsylvania German). However, the Swiss Mennonites never did practice strict shunning as the Lowland Anabaptists did. The ban meant that believers would terminate contact with a non-conforming member of the Mennonite society. Amman insisted upon this practice, even to the point of a spouse's refusing to sleep or eat with the banned member until he/she repented of his/her behavior.\n\nThis strict literalism brought about a division of the Swiss Mennonites, who, because of unwelcoming conditions in Switzerland, were scattered throughout Alsace to the Palatinate. This division occurred in 1693, and led to the establishment of the Amish. Because the Amish are the result of a division with the Mennonites, some consider the Amish a conservative Mennonite group—and, indeed, some Amish would not disagree with this title. Some Amish began to migrate to the United States in the 18th century. Many would eventually settle in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania; the first immigrants actually went to Berks County, but later moved, motivated partly by security issues, tied to the French and Indian War, and land issues. Other groups settled in or spread to Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Maryland, Tennesee, Wisconsin, Maine, and Canada."

"2","superconductivity?","What is it? any examples?","Certain materials allow electric currents to pass more freely than others.  We all know about copper, iron, silver and gold being conductors of this type.  However, even the best natural conductors offer some resistance to the passage of that current.  This resistance results in power loss due to heat.  It has been found that some materials, metals, metal alloys, and some ceramics, when cooled sufficiently, will pass those same currents without any loss due to heat.  This is very important for items like electromagnets which require huge amounts of current to create the kinds of magnetic fields that are useful, and still be efficient.  Since power is the square of the current (measured in amps) and resistance (measured in ohms), if the resistance is zero, no power is used to create the magnetic field."

"1","How do we know that Jesus was resurrected from the dead?","","There is, of course, no conclusive, CSI-type evidence that proves Christ's resurrection.  But consider the following:\n\nThose who felt threatened by Christ's resurrection (Jewish leadership, Roman authorities) were unable to produce a body to disprove the resurrection of Christ.\n\nThe fact that women are the first to find the empty tomb actually lends some credibility to the story.  A concocted story from first-century Judaea would not have placed women (who were not considererd reliable witnesses and who did not even have the right to testify in court) in such a prominent position in the story, because it would have made the story less believeable among contemporaries.\n\nMany people who knew Christ during his lifetime and who had witnessed his death sure didn't act like their rabbi was dead and gone.  On the contrary, Jesus's disciples behaved as though they KNEW that he was not dead - they risked their lives preaching the Good News.  Why would they all have done that if they knew it was a lie?  What's the point of dying for something you know to be untrue?\n\nDoes any of this prove that Jesus was resurrected?  No - and that proof will never be available.  The resurrection was, is, and always will be a matter of faith.  These are just a few thoughts to consider as you make your reasoned faith-judgment."
"2","[Optics] Is a convex lens always focusing? Is a concave lens always defocusing?","","The answer is: no.\n\nIt is not the shape of the lens that is important. It is the speed of the propagating wave in the medium in the lens relative to its speed in the medium outside the lens. \n\nConvex lenses made of glass in air focus rays of light. That is because light travels slower in glass than in air, so it is bent and becomes focussed. \n\nIf a convex lens was made of a material in which light travelled fast, and this was immersed in a medium in which light travelled slower, then it would not focus the light, but defocus the light. \n\nSuppose that one had a convex lens of rock, and the propagating wave was sound in air. Since sound travels through rock faster than air, the convex lens of rock would defocus the sound."

The formula yields: V = pi rh/3 = 20000pi/3 cubic feet. Since it weighs 50 pounds per cubic foot, the ratio 50 lbs/ft.^3 = 1. So multiplying this to our volume equation, V = 20000pi/3 ft.^3 = 20000pi/3 ft.^3 * 50lbs/ft.^3 = 100000pi/3 lbs. The work function is (25-x)100000pi/3 = W(x).

"2","Is a seasonal pond with creek a good location for a well to be installed?","The geology of the area around the house is such that water can only be found in fissures in the rocks, making water very difficult to find in the neighborhood. The house in question that I am interested has a seasonal pond and a well that gets 40 gpm. I don't know the level of the surface water in the well yet or it's exact location in relation to the seasonal pond and creek. There is a concrete canal nearby, but I am sure that does not allow much water to permeate into the ground.","If you have no other choice then go for it. Keep enough of a distance so the water will filter through the ground first. Also go as deep as you can and install a filter system to your water line. Good luck...if it ever goes dry call a water company to have it refilled."
"2","what causes granite to be transformed into gneiss?How is sandstone transformed into quartzite?","","Short, succinct and correct answer: \nHEAT and PRESSURE cause granite to become gneiss and change sandstone into quartzite.\n\nMore fleshed out, fuller (and still correct) answer:\nMetamorphic rocks form from heat and pressure which changes the original or parent rock into a completely new rock. The parent rock can be either sedimentary, igneous, or even another metamorphic rock. The word ""metamorphic"" comes from Greek and means ""To Change Form"".\n\nSolid rock can be changed into a new rock by stresses that cause an increase in heat and pressure. There are 3 main agents that cause metamorphism. Factors that cause an increase in Temperature, Pressure, and Chemical changes are the three agents that we are going to study. \n\nTemperature increases can be caused by layers of sediments being buried deeper and deeper under the surface of the Earth. As we descend into the earth the temperature increases about 25 degrees Celsius for every kilometer that we descend. The deeper the layers are buried the hotter the temperatures become. The great weight of these layers also causes an increase in pressure, which in turn, causes an increase in temperature. \n\nThe descending of rock layers at subduction zones causes metamorphism in two ways; the shearing effect of the plates sliding past each other causes the rocks coming in contact with the descending rocks to change. Some of the descending rock will melt because of this friction. When rock melts it is then considered igneous not metamorphic, but the rock next to the melted rock can be changed by the heat and become a metamorphic rock.\n\nMetamorphic rocks are almost always harder than sedimentary rocks. They are generally as hard and sometimes harder than igneous rocks. They form the roots of many mountain chains and are exposed to the surface after the softer outer layers of rocks are eroded away. Many metamorphic rocks are found in mountainous regions today and are a good indicator that ancient mountains were present in areas that are now low hill or even flat plains.\n\nGneiss is a high grade metamorphic rock. This means that gneiss has been subjected to more heat and pressure than many other metamorphic rocks. The minerals that compose gneiss are the same as granite. Feldspar is the most important mineral that makes up gneiss along with mica and quartz. Gneiss can be formed from a sedimentary rock such as sandstone or shale, or it can be formed from the metamorphism of the igneous rock granite. Gneiss can be used as paving and building stone.\n\nQuartzite is much harder than the parent rock sandstone. It forms from sandstone that has come into contact with deeply buried magmas. Quartzite looks very similar to its parent rock. The best way to tell quartzite from sandstone is to break the rocks. Sandstone will shatter into many individual grains of sand while quartzite will break across the grains."

Basically if you burn any organic material (eg natural gas, petroleum, coal or wood) without providing it with enough air it only half burns. The product of that half burning is carbon monoxide.\n\n>>>>and how do we get it?\n\nWe 'get' it mostly out of internal combustion engines, the manufacture of charcoal and the coking of coal. It can also be produced by voclanoes and various other chemical proceses.\n\nIt was once commonly piped into houses and streetlamps as 'town gas' or 'producer gas'. It burns quite well and in the days before electricity it was the main source of lighting in cities as well as fuel for ovens. It was still being used in some parts of the world up until the 1970s at least. It may still be used in some places.\n\n___________\n\nAddenda\n\nAlin said ""when you burn a piece of wood you get the smoke \n>>>>      wich is mostly CO2 (carbon dioxide) wich is not as \n>>>>      toxic and you can smell it. \n\nSmoke is not mostly carbon dioxide.

"2","who discovered the cure for a smallpox??","","it was edward jenner. but will u be satisfied with tht? i think i can tell u more...\n\nSmallpox is a viral disease characterized by a skin rash and a high death rate.\nOverview, Causes, & Risk Factors\n\nSmallpox was once found throughout the world, causing illness and death wherever it occurred. Smallpox was primarily a disease of children and young adults, with family members often infecting each other.\n\nA massive program by the World Health Organization (WHO) eradicated all known smallpox viruses from the world in 1977, except for samples that were saved by various governments for research purposes. The vaccine was discontinued in the United States in 1972. In 1980, WHO recommended that all countries stop vaccinating for smallpox.\n\nIn 1980, WHO also recommended that the remaining virus samples be transferred to two WHO laboratories for storage. Those laboratories were the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, and a laboratory in Russia. Russia, however, started a program to produce the smallpox virus in mass quantities, specifically for bombs and other weaponry.\n\nSome believe that other countries such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea may also hold some stores of the smallpox virus. Researchers continue to debate whether or not to kill the last remaining samples of the virus, or to preserve it in case there may be some future reason to study it.\n\nAccording to the CDC, since the vaccine has not been administered in the U.S. since 1972, those persons who had received the vaccine in the past are likely susceptible now (as are those who have never been vaccinated). It is not known how long previous vaccinations would remain effective, but it is unlikely that people would still have a high enough level of immunity to protect against the virus.\n\nRisk factors for smallpox include being a laboratory worker who handles the virus (rare), or being in the environment where the virus was released as a biological weapon.\n\nTHE RISK OF TERRORISM\n\nIt is conceivable that smallpox could be deliberately reintroduced into the population. Smallpox could be released by aerosol, and it would spread easily because the virus remains very stable in aerosol form.\n\nIt would take no more than 50-100 cases to cause legitimate concern on an international level. Emergency measures would need to be taken immediately.\n\nSmallpox is highly contagious from one person to another. It is most contagious during the first week, and is spread from saliva droplets. It may continue to be contagious until the scabs from the rash fall off. It may also be spread from bed sheets and clothing.\n\nResearchers believe that the smallpox infection (if released in aerosol form, under favorable conditions, without sunlight) could remain viable for as long as 24 hours. In unfavorable conditions, the virus may only remain viable for 6 hours. There is clear evidence that shows that the virus can remain viable on bed linens and clothes for significant periods of time.\nSmallpox Symptoms & Signs\n\nSmallpox has two forms: 1) Variola major -- which is a serious illness with a mortality rate according to the CDC of 30% or more, in unvaccinated people, and 2) Variola minor -- a milder infection with a mortality rate of less than 1%. The incubation period for smallpox is approximately 12-14 days. The symptoms are:\n\nHigh fever \nFatigue \nSevere headache \nBackache \nMalaise \nRash, raised and pink on the skin, starting centrally and spreading outwards. (First the mucosa of the mouth and throat, then face, forearms, trunk, and legs. Rash turns to pus-filled lesions that become crusty on the eighth or ninth day.) \nDelirium \nVomiting and diarrhea \nExcessive bleeding \n\nSmallpox Prevention\n\nMany people were vaccinated for smallpox in the past -- but the vaccination is no longer given because the virus has been eradicated. According to the CDC, the United States has supply of the smallpox vaccine sufficient for the entire population at this time.\n\nThe"

"2","Describe the processes that cause these chemical substances to move into and out of cells.?","","It would depend on several factors. Small, uncharged molecules can pass through the cell membrane through diffusion. When it is water, it is called osmosis. Diffusion can only occur into the cell when the concentration of the substance is greater outside the cell than within it, and likewise only out of the cell when the concetration is greater inside the cell than outside. This is called the concentration gradient.\n\nWhen the molecule is charged or is large (such as a chlorine ion or a lactose molecule), it requires active transport by carrier proteins. There are also carrier proteins that help to transport against the concentration gradient.\n\n[Edit] \nAfter thinking for a bit, I believe it would be pertinent to include something about the more complex methods of active transport.\n\nThere are two ""directions"" of the complex forms of active transport: in (endocytosis) and out (exocytosis).\n\nExocytosis is when a vesicle, after being released from the Golgi complex, fuses to the cell membrane, releasing the contents.\n\nEndocytosis is done by three main means: Phagocytosis, Pinocytosis, and Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis.\n\nPhagocytosis is the process of enveloping a large particle, such as how many unicellular organisms ""eat"" other organisms. The large particle comes in contact with the cell membrane, stimulating the formation of a vesicle. This vesicle then enters the cell and depending on the contents may fuse with a lysosome to help to digest it.\n\nPinocytosis also forms a vesicle, but differs from phagocytosis because it forms a much smaller vesicle.\n\nReceptor-mediated endocytosis is when particles that cannot normally enter the cell bond to receptor proteins embedded in the cell membrane. These proteins then congregate and form a vesicle. \n\nIn all forms of endocytosis and exocytosis, ATP is required for energy."

I just know there are just about every kind of specialist there is for pediatric patients."

"2","Are there any real living organisms discovered till now in the outer space?","","Not yet. Organic molecules, considered as precursors to basic life forms, have been found throughout the Universe (mostly in comets, interstellar gas and dust). Experiments show that some bacteria and archaea can survive the severity of outer space. So it's quite possible that we find living organisms in the future, most probably on other planets."

Abdul Kalam, is the current President of India. He is also a notable scientist and an engineer. He is often referred to as the Missile Man of India.\n\nhim in the past. His book ""India 2020"" strongly advocates an action plan to develop India into a knowledge superpower and into a developed nation by the year 2020. Kalam is credited with the view that India ought to take a more assertive stance in international relations; he apparently regards his work on India's nuclear weapons program as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.\n\n \nDorrit Moussaieff with Indian president Abdul Kalam in the National Gallery of IcelandKalam continues to take an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology as well. He has proposed a research programme to increase intelligence using bio-implants. He is a supporter of Open source software over proprietary solutions and believes that the use of open source software on a large scale will bring more people the benefits of information technology.\n\n[edit]\nPersonal life\nKalam observes strict personal discipline, practicing vegetarianism, teetotalism and celibacy. Kalam is a scholar of Tirukkural; in most of his speeches, he quotes at least one kural. It is believed that he reads the Qur'an (the main holy text of his family's faith, Islam) regularly and also the Bhagavad Gita at times. Kalam has written several inspirational books, most notably his autobiography Wings of Fire, aimed at motivating Indian youth. Another of his books, Guiding Souls: Dialogues on the Purpose of Life reveals his spiritual side. It has been reported that there is considerable demand in South Korea for translated versions of books authored by him.\n\n[edit]\nTrivia\nHe is a vegetarian. \nHe loves children, and encourages their audiences with him. [citation needed] \nOn Tuesday, 14 February, 2006, he created history by becoming the country's first President to undertake an undersea journey. Abdul Kalam boarded the INS Sindhurakshak, a Russian-origin kilo class submarine, from the Vishakapattanam Naval dockyard. The duration of the journey was around three-and-half hours during which Kalam had lunch with the crewmembers. \n[edit]\nBooks\nIndia 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Y.S.

Don't get me wrong-I HATE it when people smoke w/ their kids around--my parents did it & I have asthma, but when you start taking away rights from people because people think it's wrong, it opens the door for the government to start controlling everything!"

"1","Why are old people always in such a rush, when they're waiting in line at the checkout?","I actually work in a South Florida supermarket, and I notice this all the time.  When someone is checking out in front of an old person, and the bagger is finishing up with the last few bags, the cranky senior alwanys wants to push them out of the way as quickly as possible.  I also notice this all the time. Once, I was browsing through the CD's at the local dollar store, and some old guy came up and started looking around.  We initially agreed that neither one of us had any problem sharing space to look through the items, but when I left and came back later, the old guy started shouting ""Hey, why don't you take that box of stuff over to the table over there, and get out of my way""?  How typical, I thought.","I think it is not only elderly that have this sense of impatience...I think it is American culture in general. We feel are lives are more important then anyone else and we push and push our way through this world. It happens at grocery stores, on the freeways and in the street. Oh, I have to get this done, because I have this to do. Not taking a moment to think that maybe the person next to you may have even more important things to do than yourself...We are a selfish culture!"
"2","What is Reverse Engineering?","","The object of reverse engineering is to take an unknown structure apart and discover its principles of operation.  Perhaps you could take a huge rock apart to discover how Nature designed it.  Of course competitors may reverse engineer your product to try to build a better one or even to determine whether you have infringed on their own patents.  Detroit must do a certain amount of reverse engineering, otherwise all cars would only go forward <G>."
"1","question to parents teaching religous practice to their children..?","though i am not religious, i have studied (and continue to study) religion very in-depth.  i have to say that the thing that ""irks"" me the most about religion is the belief of absolute truth that people have about their particular religion, that they pass on to their children.  i was curious if any of you out there could reassure me or share how you teach your own children about your religion?  do you make it clear to them that there are other people out there with different beliefs, and teach them about those beliefs too?  personally, the existance of religions other than catholocism was never even mentioned to me when i was younger..  i just need to know that there are people out there that are sharing the big picture with their kids.","I don't have children yet, but I plan to.  And when I do, I plan on teaching them the fundamentals (at the very least) of all major faith's (and some not so major).  Because I don't think there's merely ""one"" true path to the Divine, I will encourage them to seek out and choose their own way.\n\nI feel it's absolutely essential to encouraging tolerance and understanding among their peers.  I think it's good for them to understand what makes people think differently, and what our similarities are.  As they grow into adults and enter the work force, they will be that much more prepared to handle the dynamics of a multi-cultural environment."
"1","Could it just be the faith?","Whats the one thing most major religions have in the common? The Bible. Each religion has applied it diffrently, but they all use it.

"2","How far away did the ash from Mount Vesuvuis travel?","","Depends on which eruption you're talking about. \nThe most famous eruption, which covered Pompeii in 79 A.D., deposited ash in a 186 square mile radius. \n\nFrom Wikipedia's entry on Vesuvius:\nVesuvius has erupted repeatedly in recorded history, most famously in 79 and subsequently in 472, 512, in 1631, six times in the 18th century, eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929, and 1944. There has been no eruption since then. The eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterised by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed Plinian after the Roman writer who observed the AD 79 eruption. On occasion, the eruptions have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ashes; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ashes fell on Constantinople (now known as Istanbul), over 1,000 miles away. The volcano has been quiescent since 1944."

This so-called smoking gun is centered on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and was discovered by Tony Camargo and Glen Pentfield while working as geophysicists for the Mexican oil company PEMEX. What they reported as a circular feature later turned out to be a crater estimated to be 180 kilometers in diameter. Other researchers would later find that the end-Cretaceous extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs had lasted for thousands of years instead of millions of years as had previously been thought. This would be the final piece of evidence that convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extra-terrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change (which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period).""\n\nIt seems to be a bit more than a layer of clay in the ground.\n\nwhether this is worthy enough for biblical mention is debatable, but it seems that such a large impact would have had tremendous effects on any living species at the time, including (as creationists claim) humans.  why is there no mention of it either in the bible or other human cultures?  probably because it happened long before any humans were around.  it would have been a very important event, more important than a lot of the mentioned events in the bible.\n\nand if it is mentioned in the bible, please provide a passage."

"1","If you speak more than a Language, what controls whom to speak to in a specific language?","most of us speaks more than a language. So what part of the brain decides the language to be spoken with with certin people?","Languages are learnt by absorbing it's dialects by the subconcious mind. When you learn a language when you are grown up it is harder to learn it. The same language would have been learnt easily had it been learnt in childhood. For example , if you begin to learn chinese it is extremely difficult when you are grown up as your concious mind interferes with the learning process but have you noticed that the chinese children have mastered it since their early years? The same Logic holds true for all languages.\n\nNow coming to the central point of using a language. This is governed by your mood & your requirement of Communicating. The best of the best speakers communicating in many languages  ALWAYS curse , use unusable words in THEIR MOTHER TONGUE. But when it comes to meeting their needs they revert to what will benefit them the most. For example ,according to your moods, governed by the subconcious partly residing in the Right brain you will pass comments on a woman/man you have a crush on, in a language she/he won't understand in a Public place. So you can see that the usage of language is governed by your mind especially the subconcious."

"2","a gamma ray has an equation of y = A sin Bt. What is B if the wavelength is 3 x 10^ -10 cm and c = 3 x 10^10?","","In y = A sin Bt, B is the frequency in radians/second, or B = 2pi*f, where f is the frequency in cycles/second, or Hertz.\n\nI assume by ""c= 3 x 10^10"", you're referring to the speed of light, which is 3*10^10 cm/sec.\n\nf = c / wavelength, so f = 3*10^10 cm/sec / (3*10^-10cm) = 3*10^20 cycles/sec or 3*10^20Hz.\n\nSo B = 2*pi*f = 2*pi*3*10^20 = 6*pi*10^20 radians/sec.  That's about 1.885*10^21 radians/sec.\n\nNote that these equations hold for all electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, microwaves, IR, light, UV, X rays, and gamma rays."
"1","Why do people ........?","why do people hate christians????? explain? what do people have against them?","Most people hate christians, becuase that they think that Christians are trying to convert them into something that they don't want to be. When in reality God is calling them to a relationship with Him. They are taking their frustrations with God out on the person that is happy being in a relationship with Him. Not out fault your mad at God! \n\nAlso, you have to remember that God said that the church would be persecuted because of Him. We are called to be strong through it all and and keep pressing toward the mark! \n\nNon-beleivers have to remember that every person that claims to be a christian is not one. Just because Bush says he's Christians doesnt' mean that he speaks for all Christians, just because Bobby Joe from around the corner claimed to be a christians and you caught him doing something contrary to Christians beleifs doesn't mean that he speaks for me. That's the biggest problem, they hate people judging them when the person judging is doing the same thing they are doing. The reality, however, is that God is judging and that is all that matters!"

But then I decided to finally just put all the reasons aside and I sat down with open mind and heart and read the Book of Mormon and then prayed about it like it asks the reader to at the end, and you will receive an answer if its true or not. There isn't going to being any fireworks but a spirtual sense of connection.  Do you think that the gospel being one of its main principles is faith would have proof to validate itself, of course not because that would eliminate the need for faith.  I got my validation from  my prayer after I read it rather then trying to criticize it and go by known ""facts"".","I was married to a mormon once, and her daddy was a bishop.  For her sake I tried to validate mormonism, but Joseph Smith was a lying con artist who victimized the weak and ignorant.

Thanks!!","I have no idea about the second part of your question, and I'm not entirely sure if it's true, but I'll tell you what RNA is.\n\nRNA is essentially a copy of DNA that can travel out of the nucleus and to other parts of the cell. RNA is used as instructions. DNA can't leave the cell or it'll be destroyed by enzymes looking for viruses.\n\nMessenger RNA (or mRNA) is the one that goes from the nucleus to the ribosomes (where proteins are made) with instructions for which specific protein is to be made. Transfer RNA (tRNA) brings the appropriate amino acids (pieces of protein) to the Ribosomes so that the desired proteins can be made.\n\nthere are many other types of RNA, such as ribosomal RNA, but I know much less about those.\nhope this helps!"

"2","Are all the controll rods pulled when the nuclear power plant run at maximum?","","I am assuming you are asking if all rods are fully withdrawn - the answer is no.  Since the fuel (e.g., uranium) is gradually spent when it undergoes fission, you have to put more uranium than you initially need into the reactor core.  Otherwise, you would have to keep adding fuel (this would be expensive) in order to keep operating at the ""max"" power.  Since it is slow and painful to change out the fuel, the fuel cells contain more fuel than they need, and so the plant operates with the control rods only partially withdrawn.  As the plant ages and the fuel is being used up, the height at which the rods are maintained increases, until the end of the reactor core life, when the rods being fully withdrawn will not supply enough power.  This is simplified explanation; there are a lot of other factors which affect rod height also (temperature, recent power history, etc.).  I have ignored those for simplicity - it is still an accurate explanation.\n\nIf you are asking if some control rods remain at the bottom of the core when operating, I've never seen this.  I have, however, seen reactors where SOME rods are fully withdrawn, while the remaining ones are only partially withdrawn."

"2","What is the difference between ketoconazole & fluconazole?","HI\niam a pharmacist and i have assignment in medicinal chemistry in the differences between ketoconazole and fluconazole in SAR(structure activity relation ship)\nthnxx","Ketoconazole is a synthetic antifungal drug used to prevent and treat skin and fungal infections, especially in immunocompromised patients such as those with AIDS. Due to its side-effect profile, it has been superseded by newer antifungals, such as fluconazole and itraconazole. Ketoconazole is sold commercially as an anti-dandruff shampoo, branded Nizoral®, by Janssen Pharmaceutica.\n\nKetoconazole is very lipophilic, which leads to accumulation in fatty tissues. The less toxic and more effective triazole compounds fluconazole and itraconazole have largely replaced ketoconazole for internal use. Ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids or other causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug's efficacy when taken orally.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoconazole\n\n\nFluconazole (INN) (IPA: [fluˈkɒnəzoʊl]) is a triazole antifungal drug used in the treatment and prevention of superficial and systemic fungal infections. It is commonly marketed under the trade name Diflucan (Pfizer).\n\nMode of action\nLike other imidazole- and triazole-class antifungals, fluconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14α-demethylase. Mammalian demethylase activity is much less sensitive to fluconazole than fungal demethylase. This inhibition prevents the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell wall, and subsequent accumulation of 14α-methyl sterols. Fluconazole is primarily fungistatic, however may be fungicidal against certain organisms in a dose-dependent manner.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"
"2","What is the structure of chlorophyll?What is the energy transfer mechanism?","Alternatively where can I find more info on this topic?","Chlorophyll is a green photosynthetic pigment found in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Its name is derived from ancient Greek: chloros = green and phyllon = leaf. Chlorophyll absorbs most strongly in the blue and red but poorly in the green portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues like plant leaves.\n\nBesides chlorophyll a, there are other pigments, called accessory pigments, which occur in these pigment-protein antenna complexes. They include other forms of chlorohphyll, such as chlorophyll b in green algal and higher plant antennae, while other algae may contain chlorophyll c or d. In addition, there are many non-chlorophyll accessory pigments, such as carotenoids or phycobilins which also absorb light and transfer that light energy to the photosystem chlorophylls. Some of these accessory pigments, particularly the carotenoids, also serve to absorb and dissipate excess light energy, or work as antioxidants. The large, physically associated group of chlorophylls and other accesory pigments is sometimes referred to as a pigment bed, though this term is losing prominence with the advent of detailed knowledge of the structural organization of the photosystem and antenna complexes.\n\nThe function of the reaction center chlorophyll is to use the light energy absorbed by and transferred to it from the other chlorophylls in the photosystems to undergo a charge separation, a specific redox reaction in which the chlorophyll donates an electron into a series of molecular intermediates called an electron transport chain. The charged reaction center chlorophyll (P680+) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron. In Photosystem II, the electron which reduces P680+ ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into O2 and H+ through several intermediates. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms like plants produce O2 gas, and is the source for practically all the O2 in Earth's atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II, thus the P700+ of Photosystem I is usually reduced, via many intermediates in the thylacoid membrane, by electrons ultimately from Photosystem II. Electron transfer reactions in the thylacoid membranes are complex, however, and the source of electrons used to reduce P700+ can vary. The electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorohpylls is used to shuttle H+ ions across the thylacoid membrane, setting up a chemiosmotic potential mainly used to produce ATP chemical energy, and those electrons ultimately reduce NAD+ to NADPH a universal reductant used to reduce CO2 into sugars as well as for other biosynthetic reductions."

"2","if a motorcycle travels 40 miles at x miles per hour and 50 miles at x+10 mph what's the average speed?","","Every answer I've seen to this question so far has been dead wrong (or at least mostly wrong).\n\nTo compute average speed in any word problem, figure out the total distance traveled, total time traveled, and then divide. average speed = (total distance)/(total time)\n\nTotal distance traveled here is clearly 40+50 = 90 miles.\n\nTotal time traveled is a bit trickier, so we'll look at this one leg at a time. For the first leg of the journey, we went 40 miles at x mph. Time elapsed is the distance traveled divided by the rate of speed, or 40/x. Does this check out? Let x be a nice easy number like 20 mph and check it for yourself.\n\nThen the time for the second leg will be 50/(x+10), and total time is 40/x + 50/(x+10).\n\nNow we've got total distance and total time, so we just divide to get the final answer:\naverage speed = 90/(40/x + 50/(x+10))\n\nWe can pick a value for x to see if this makes sense. Let x = 40. Then on the first leg we traveled 40 miles at 40 miles an hour (so clearly 1 hour) and on the second leg we traveled 50 miles at 40+10= 50 miles per hour (so another hour). Total time is therefore 2 hours for this case, and average speed is 45 miles per hour. We get the same answer by plugging x = 40 into the final answer, so it checks out at least for this case.\n\nNote that the correct answer will only be 45 mph if x = 40. Any other value of x will produce a different result, and we don't have any information given to us that will give us x, so the best we can do is test different values of x just to make sure our answers make some sort of sense.\n\nAlso note that the obvious answer that you get by averaging x and x + 10 to give you x + 5 is wrong in general (it turns out to be correct if x = 40, but we don't really know if this is the case). We can't just average speeds together unless we know that an equal amout of time was spent traveling at each of these speeds, and we don't. This is a very popular standardized test trap that most people will fall for."

"2","why the peole sleep after work whole day/night ( not wanting)?","","Sleep is the regular state of natural rest observed in all mammals, birds and fish. Sleep is not actually ""unconsciousness,"" but rather, it is a natural state of rest characterized by a reduction in voluntary body movement, decreased awareness of the surroundings, an increased rate of anabolism (the synthesis of cell structures) and a decreased rate of catabolism (the breakdown of cell structures). Therefore, since consciousness is literally the awareness of the surroundings, being asleep is just an altered state of consciousness, as opposed to being unconscious. It is heavily influenced by circadian rhythms and by hormonal and environmental factors. Sleep performs a restorative function for the brain and body as evidenced by the myriad symptoms of metabolic dysfunction that result when animals are deprived of sleep.\nThe function of sleep in health and in disease is being increasingly studied in specialized sleep laboratories throughout the world. Not only insomnia, but more recently elucidated sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy are evaluated in such facilities. The increasing prevalence of sleep disorders is likely to be a function both of more sophisticated diagnostic tests and the disruption of the normal day-night cycle in modern societies."

"1","If there were no Hell, and no punishment for not belieivng/ loving God...?","Would you still love God?  Would this make you love God more or less?  \n\nPlease justify your answer.","Yes, I would still love God. I like him, and I like spending time with him just learning and growing. I love him because I want to, not because I'm afraid of hell.\n\nI think that your question goes a little deeper than just that though. Something to think about: if I do something wrong, like steal, I have to be punished, maybe even sent to prison. If I wasn't, then justice would not be served and I would get away with it. Now I'm just one person. What if we let the whole world get away with stealing? We would have total chaos. We punish our criminals because we believe in justice. \n\nGod can't let us get away with out sin either. If he did, the world would be totally chaotic. If he didn't punish us for the things that we did wrong, then he would no longer be just. \n\nSo if God is just, then how is it possible that we can go to heaven? Jesus (God's Son), lived on the earth and never sinned. He died on the cross to take our place and received the punishment that we deserve. And since he conquered sin (he never sinned), he rose from the dead on the third day, conquering death as well. SO, if we as individuals accept Jesus, allowing him to take the punishment instead of us, then we get to have a relationship with God, and spend eternity praising him and enjoying him forever.  \n\nIf we weren't punished for our sins, then God would not be just. Being just is an important part of who he is. In fact, if he were not just, he would be completely different, and so would our world. (Just picture living in a world with no punishment for crimes)."

"1","What is the difference between Zen Buddhism and regular Buddhism?","I am a Buddhist without ever set foot in any sort of Buddhist temple, just from meditating.","There are many forms of Buddhism and as you know, Zen is only one of them.  Zen is a form of Mahayana Buddhism. The Name Zen is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese Character Ch'an which was the name given to the Dhyana teachings of Buddhism. \n\nA few of the more distinctive teachings of Zen(Ch'an) are:\n- Zen puts a great deal of emphases on meditation. This includes traditional sitting meditation, walking meditation and meditation while performing daily tasks such as eating, working, etc...\n- Zen puts little emphases on textual studies. Zen practitioners do read the sutras, but unlike many other forms of Buddhism, the sutras are not considered the paramount in the achievement of enlightenment. \n- Some forms of Buddhism, such as most schools of Tibetan Buddhism as well as Pure Land schools of Buddhism have many ceremonies, and rituals. Zen has many fewer and less 'secretive' practices.  \n- The Use of the Koan.  Most other schools of Buddhism believe that Enlightenment comes from a deep understanding of the doctrines of Buddhism. Zen teaches the enlightenment is a spontaneous response that is NOT perpetuated by classical study and knowledge... It just happens. A koan is a question, statement or story that generally contains aspects that are inaccessible to rational understanding, yet may be accessible to intuition and thus lead to enlightenment. \n- Generally speaking, Zen puts less emphases on Buddha the man and more on Buddha's teachings. \n\nI hope this helps."

So, written in complete ionic form, that equation would be:\n\nK+(aq) + OH-(aq) + H+(aq) + NO3-(aq) --> H2O(l) + K+(aq) + NO3-(aq)\n\nTo get to the net ionic equation, you just cross out the things that are the same on both sides of the arrow.

"1","What is the best way to over come your fear?","U have to deal wit negitive, disappointment, and rejection. how do u look over that?","Everyone feels nervous or afraid at one time or another.  But, if you want to be successful and do everything you  want in life, you’ll need to overcome occasional attacks of fear. Eleanor Roosevelt once said: “You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing which you think you cannot do.”  It may make you feel uncertain to even think of attempting to do things that scare you, but isn’t it even more frightening to miss out on your dreams and aspirations? \n\nHave you ever done something that initially scared you, but then in retrospect you realized that it was not as scary as you originally thought? Your imagination had actually taken your fear and magnified it in your mind. Remember, your imagination is incredibly powerful. \n\nBefore you can eliminate fear from your life, you’ll need to identify exactly what it is that you fear. Start by forming a written list of things you want to do, but have avoided because of fear. It doesn’t matter if you have a few or a lot of items on your list, it is up to you to name them and begin to delete them – one fear at a time. Then, for each of your fears ask yourself the following questions. Each answer will help you understand more about your fears and move you closer to overcoming them.\n\n1. What is it that is making me afraid?\n\n2. Is this a fear I want to overcome and delete from my life?\n\n3. Am I allowing this fear to keep me from achieving my dreams?\n\n4. If I did the thing that I fear what would happen to me physically?\n\n5. What would happen to me mentally?\n\n6. Would the opinions of others matter to me if I did this? If so, why? \n\n7. What’s the worst thing that could happen if I did this? Could I live with this outcome?\n\n8. What’s the best thing that could happen if I did  this? Would this outcome make me happier than I am right now?\n\n9. If I never overcome this fear would I feel regret later in life?"
"2","What is 'space dust'?","","Well...interstellar dust comes from a variety of sources, but mostly from the atmospheres of very old stars. In the outer layers of these red giant and red supergiant stars, the temperatures are so low that dust grains made of silicon monoxide or graphite can condense like rain drops directly from the stars material. The dust grains are whafted into space by radiation pressure or by some mechanical means, and over billions of years and millions of stars, they form a persistent 'medium' of dust grains everywhere. As they collect along with interstellar hydrogen gas, into vast clouds, their surfaces become very chemically active and they serve as catalysts for forming complex molecules in the interstellar medium. Dust grains are the repository of most of the interstellar medium's 'heavy elements' beyond helium. There seems to be very little dust in intergalactic space, and most of the dust we can detect seems to reside within galaxies to one degree or another. Elliptical galaxies seem nt to have much of an interstellar medium at all, while some spiral galaxies are so loaded with dust that it extinguishes a significant fraction of the light from the other stars in the galaxy. Some galaxies have such tremendous episodes of star formation occurring that the dust in these galaxies converts nearly 100 percent of the light into infrared radiation and so you get ultra luminous galaxies in the infrared, but which are very hard to detect at optical wavelengths. Typical interstellar dust grains are about 1/2 of a micron in diameter, but can grow up to several microns or more in the deep dark cores of collapsing dust clouds. Eventually these dust grains stick together to form ever larger bodies all the way up to asteroids and planets!"

"2","what did pythagoras contributed in mathematics?","tell all","""Pythagoras of Samos was a Greek philosopher responsible for important developments in mathematics, astronomy and the theory of music. He left Samos because of the tyrant who ruled there and went to southern Italy about 532 BC. He founded a philosophical and religious school in Croton that had many followers.\n\nAlthough the theorem now known as Pythagoras's theorem was known to the Babylonians 1000 years earlier he may have been the first to prove it.\n\nOf his actual work nothing is known. His school practised secrecy and communalism making it hard to distinguish between the work of Pythagoras and that of his followers. His school made outstanding contributions to mathematics.\n\nPythagoreans believed that all relations could be reduced to number relations. This generalisation stemmed from observations in music, mathematics and astronomy.\n\nThe Pythagoreans noticed that vibrating strings produce harmonious tones when the ratios of the lengths of the strings are whole numbers, and that these ratios could be extended to other instruments.\n\nThe most important discovery of this school was the fact that the diagonal of a square is not a rational multiple of its side. This result showed the existence of irrational numbers. Not only did this disturb Greek mathematics but the Pythagoreans' own belief that whole numbers and their ratios could account for geometrical properties was challenged by their own results.\n\nIn astronomy Pythagoras taught that the Earth was a sphere at the centre of the Universe. He also recognised that the orbit of the Moon was inclined to the equator of the Earth and he was one of the first to realise that Venus as an evening star was the same planet as Venus as a morning star.

"2","what is the damping required for The Millennium Bridge?","The Millennium Bridge which was built in 2000","The motion was caused by the human reaction to small lateral movements in the bridge, which set up a driven harmonic motion in the bridge. As such the motion was not anticipated by the computational analysis of the bridge prior to construction. It is often thought that the unusually low profile of the suspension cables contributed to the problem, but an analysis by the structural engineer, Arup, shows that it can occur in any suspension bridge which happens to have the appropriate resonant frequencies. After extensive analysis, the problem was fixed by the retrofitting of 37 fluid-viscous dampers (energy dissipating) to control horizontal movement and 52 tuned mass dampers (inertial) to control vertical movement. This took from May 2001 to January 2002 and cost £5m. After a period of testing the bridge was successfully re-opened on 22 February 2002, and as yet there have not been any noticeable severe vibrations."

Fluorine has the highest electronegativity.  It has a small electron cloud, so the outer most electrons are close to the nucleus and are more strongly pulled there.  Iodine has a large electron cloud.  The outer most electrons of iodine are much further away from the neuleus, so it can't pull electrons in as close.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nPS.  F, Cl, Br, and I all are diatomic, so they all form F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2."

"1","A simple question about GOD?","IF GOD IT'S THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF EVERYTHING. THE CREATOR!\nCAN GOD CREATES A PLANET SO BIG THAT NO EVEN GOD COULD CARRY IT?","Read this and substitute mountain, stone, rock whatever with planet.\n\nI am glad that I save these long answers. . . I would hate to type it in again (for the 6th time)\n\nGod and Omnipotence\nThe paradox of the stone, as presented by Wade Savage:\n1. Either God can create a stone that God cannot lift, or God cannot create a stone that God cannot lift – there are no other possibilities. \n2. If God can create a stone that God cannot lift, then there is at least one thing that God cannot do (i.e., lift that stone). \n3. If God cannot create a stone that God cannot lift, then there is at least one thing that God cannot do (i.e., create that stone). \n4. From the combination of 1, 2 and 3, it follows that there is at least one thing that God cannot do. \n5. If God is omnipotent, then God can do anything. \n6. Therefore, God is not omnipotent. \n\nWhat this argument apparently shows is that omnipotence is impossible (or, that the notion of omnipotence is incoherent). Thus, God cannot be omnipotent (as nothing can be).\n\nSuggested solutions to the paradox St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274):\nAquinas defines as “absolutely impossible” any thing where the “predicate is altogether incompatible with the subject” (his example: “man is an ***” (in the non-metaphorical sense)). With this in mind:\nWhatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it is more appropriate to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do them.\n\nThat is, to be omnipotent involves being able to do all things that are possible. For example, it is not considered a limit to my powers that I cannot draw a square circle. That’s impossible, so it’s no failing that I can’t do it – it cannot be done.\n\nBUT: surely I can make a thing that is too heavy for me to lift, so that task is not impossible, so if God can’t do it, that really is a limit to his power.\n\nGeorge Mavrodes (1926-):\nMavrodes responds that although “a stone too heavy for Simon Cushing to lift” is not a contradictory notion, “a stone too heavy for an omnipotent being to lift” is a contradictory notion.\nMavrodes’s argument in full:\n1. Either God is omnipotent or he is not. \n2. If God is not omnipotent, then the fact that he cannot do something (either make or lift the stone) is unsurprising. \n3. If God is omnipotent, then, by definition, there necessarily cannot be a stone that is too heavy for him to lift (otherwise he would not be omnipotent). \n4. If there necessarily cannot be such a stone, then it is an impossibility. \n5. By Aquinas’s reasoning, even an omnipotent being cannot perform impossibilities. \n6. Therefore, by definition, inability to create a stone too heavy for one to lift is no barrier to being omnipotent. (In fact, only non-omnipotent beings can create objects too heavy for themselves to lift.) \n\nBUT: both Aquinas and Mavrodes assume that God cannot do impossible things. Is this right? Descartes, for one, thought not. Descartes believed God could make 2+2=5. Why? Because otherwise you are suggesting that God is bound by the laws of logic. But if God created the laws of logic, why should he be bound by them? Couldn’t he have made them differently?\n\nHarry Frankfurt:\nHowever, if we assume that God can do impossible things, then God can create a stone too heavy for him to lift (which is supposedly impossible). Furthermore, if he can do that, then he can go one stage further and lift that stone (also impossible – but what’s the difference between doing one impossible thing and doing two?) \nBUT: doesn’t that mean that the stone he created was not a stone too heavy for him to lift, and that we’re back to the situation of him being unable to create such a stone? Not according to Frankfurt:\nIf an omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible, then he can not only create situations which he cannot handle but also, since he is"

"2","End of the world? Will it happen? When?","","Emerging scientific basis\nSee also: Timeline of cosmology and Timeline of the Big Bang \nThe theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity. General relativity can be employed to describe the universe on the largest possible scale. There are many possible solutions to the equations of general relativity, and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe. Alexander Friedmann proposed one such solution in 1921. This solution implies that the universe has been expanding from an initial singularity; this is, essentially, the Big Bang.\n\nAn important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This creates three possible ultimate fates of the universe, depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the Flat, Open and Closed universes. These three adjectives refer to the overall geometry of the universe, and not to the local curving of spacetime caused by smaller clumps of mass (for example, galaxies and stars).\n\nObservational evidence was not long in coming. In 1929, Edwin Hubble published his conclusion, based on his observations of Cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies, that the universe was expanding. From then on, the beginning of the universe and its possible end have been the subjects of serious scientific investigation. In 1933, Georges-Henri Lemaître set out a theory that has since come to be called the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe. In 1948, Fred Hoyle set out his opposing theory of a static universe, called the Steady state theory. These two theories were active contenders until the 1965 discovery, by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, of the cosmic microwave background radiation, a fact that is a straightforward prediction of the Big Bang theory, and one that the Steady State theory cannot account for. The Big Bang theory immediately became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe.\n\nWhen Einstein formulated general relativity, he and his contemporaries believed in a static universe. When Einstein found that his equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding now, and to contract in the far future, he added to those equations what he called a cosmological constant whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static. After Hubble announced his conclusion that the universe was expanding, Einstein wrote that his cosmological constant was his ""greatest blunder.""\n\nStarting in 1998, observations of supernovae in distant galaxies have been interpreted as consistent with a universe whose rate of expansion is accelerating. Subsequent cosmological theorizing has been designed so as to allow for this possible acceleration, nearly always by invoking dark energy and dark matter. Hence recent theorizing about the ultimate fate of the universe allows for a nonzero cosmological constant.\n\n[edit]\nRole of the shape of the universe\nSee also: Shape of the universe \nThe ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape, and on how much dark energy it contains.\n\n \nThe overall geometry of the universe is determined by whether Ω is less than, equal to, or greater than 1.[edit]\nClosed universe\nIf Ω>1, then the geometry of space is closed like the surface of a sphere. The sum of the angles of a triangle exceeds 180 degrees and there are no parallel lines; all lines eventually meet. The geometry of the universe is, at least on a very large scale, elliptic.\n\nIn a closed universe lacking the repulsive effect of dark energy, gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe, after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a poi"

"2","how does overpopulation effect ecological balance?","","Most systems, when left alone, will tend to come to a ""steady state"" or be at rest.  In the case of balancing the ecosystem, overpopulation is a situation that I tend to think would eventually be controlled by the environment.\n\nAs an example, consider bacteria and viruses for which not everyone is immune nor is there necessarily a vaccine.  The increase in population ensures: a) that there are more hosts for these agents to travel; and b) that the agent doesn't have that far to travel, so it does so quickly.  Epidemics have a way of balancing out overpopulation.\n\nIn some cases, people make the mistake of introducing some 'agents' (not necessarily viruses, but such as in a recent case with toads) into an environment in which they help control the population in one aspect, but then the agent itself overpopulates.  Eventually, as it runs out of food (unless it has several plentiful sources in the environment to which it's been transplanted) it too will experience a loss in population."

"1","Why are Christians a target throughout the world?","","You've got to remember.  It's not about what we perceive as reality.  The Bible says there is a war in the ""invisbles"". . .the unseen.  It is a war against the principalities and powers of Satan.  Their objective is to supplant God.  Ålways has been.  God's objective is to redeem man, to get man back into fellowship with Him.  So, as Christians, we are in the family and Satan knows to bring whatever he has to bear against us.  Sex, war, terrorism. . .whatever.  Satan knows the Bible a whole lot better than we do and he is not afraid to jack us up royally.  He is the father of lies.  Satan's goal for us is self-destruction.  Since we choose to love God and follow Him, the only way Satan can really hurt God is to get us to choose to self-destruct.  He gets us where our weakness is and then just lets sin take it course. . .the end being self-destruction.  The world is just a part of that process.  There are really only two religions in the world.  Christianity and Hinduism.  Christianity says"" you need a God"".  Hinduism, which comes in many forms from  Mormonism to Humanism to whatever says 'you can be your own god.""  If you'll recall, that's just the same old lie Satan used in the garden and is still using today.  Hope that helps."

It really almost floored me to see the common thread that runs through all of them - if you don't know what i mean, look up Bacchus on wikipedia and check that out and it will have links to the others mentioned above. The one thing that I never even thought about is the implied cannibalism - eating the body, drinking the blood. I am not trying to be offensive (though I am likely succeeding in the view of some people), but it's amazing that I have never hear that addressed, nor any of the other similarities to the other 'gods'. (Don't wig about that word or capitalization, please. If He can forgive, He can forgive typos.)\n\nI know that there a lot more bona fide adults who reply to these questions, so I hope that I can get some interesting views on it. (Other than saying that it is morally out of bounds to talk about).","Many Christian customs are borrowed from idolatrous practices because they were fun and for political purposes to keep us all on the same page. Continuation of the same old story of man and thier governments. \n\n   The original sect of the Nazarene which was a sect of Judaism obeyed the first five books of the Bible which forbid the worshipping of Yahu'eh as the other nations worshipped their idols. Yahushua is Yahu'eh the Saviour. The flesh is the Son of man created by Yahueh thus the Son of Eloah/God. Eloah is a tile for Yahueh. \n\n   Satan counterfieted many of the seed of the woman issues in pagan religions to confuse this issue. The truth is though that none of the women that claimed to be virgins were but were vestel virgins secretly practicing temple prostitution in fertility worship through Nimrod, Astoroth/Easter/Istar/Semiramis/Artemis/Diana the many breasted idol ect... to numerous in names to mention. \n\n  Then after Yahu'shua the Messiah of Nazareth came about 2-300 years culminating in the reforms of Constantine the Great, a Mithra Sun Worshipper supposedly converted to Christianity, all the traditions and custom of this sun male, and moon female, fertility worship of images entered in and nearly wiped out true Messianic or Christian beliefs. This is the great falling away and grevious wolves the original 13 apostles warned us about in many places in the New Testament some even telling us this was already starting in it's infancy in their day.Jude 4, 1John, Paul's writings etc...\n\n  Why? So if you want to be decieved and ultimately worship&#92;bow down to idols which are demons with thier leader Haylel ha Satan or the Adversary then your true intention of your heart willbe revealed to all so that when you are not allowed into the kingdom of Yahueh our God it will be just and apparent to all. Yahushua of Nazareth told parables so that those that would not see & would not be in his kingdom which is a paraphrase of verses written to this effect in the New Testament quoting Yahushua."

Statues were kept in the temples, they were bathed, dressed, had makeup applied to them and were ""fed"" daily by the priests and taken out on ""visits"" to other deities or to be paraded during various festivals.\nStatues in a broad sense in ancient Egypt were thought to be able to hold the soul or part of the soul of people and gods in order to receive offerings or to interact in some way with the living world.\nThere also seems to have been a belief that statues of various deities had healing powers as there are accounts of Egyptian deity statues being sent to other Near Eastern kings when those kings fell ill."

Once you take Steps 1 and 2, and get a decent score, there are many residency spots available for qualified foreign medical graduates (FMGs).\n\nOnce you finish residency as an FMG, depending on which visa got you here, the way to stay in the U.S. medical system working, is to go to an underserved area (inner city, rural community, VA hospital) and work there.  In the meantime, you can work on green card paperwork and permanent residency, which will allow you to work anywhere.\n\nIn terms of the environment of U.S. medicine, there is a great fear of litigation (lawsuits) which makes medicine a little bit overexhaustive and has emphasis on overdocumentation and paperwork.  There are few restrictions to the lenght of time and the intensity of care patients get.  \n\nCanada and the UK have more socialized medicine systems, where there are restrictions to the type of care people get (less ICU care, less dialysis), and wagewise, physicians make relatively less than US physicians, since many are salaried."

"2","Why are earwigs so called?","And can they get stuck in our ears?","The name ""earwig"" is generally said to originate from an old European belief that earwigs crawl into people's ears and lay eggs in the brain. This etymology is given by the Oxford English Dictionary, which states unequivocally that the name is derived from Old English éare, ""ear"", and wicga, ""insect"", ""from the notion that it penetrates into the head through the ear."" Earwigs do tend to prefer being in hidden places, and this etymology parallels the unambiguous French name perce-oreille (""ear piercer""). Another hypothesis is that the word comes from the Late Latin auricula, owing to the ancient use of pulverized earwigs as medicine to treat diseases of the ear. A third explanation is that it is an alteration of ""ear-wing"", after the shape of the hind wings when unfolded."

"1","Matthew 23:9 - ""Call no man Father""?","I posed a question recently about why Catholics call the Pope ""Holy Father"", and received one reply quoting the Bible and saying, ""In the bible it says ""call no man Father"" Are we to take this literally? Are Catholics wrong to call their priests ""Father""?","On occasion, you will encounter one of our separated brethren who will criticize Catholics because we call our priests ""father"", citing the verse above ""And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your father, who is in heaven."" (Mt 23:9 KJV) If one takes this passage literally, this might seem to be a fair criticism.\n\nWhat does this individual call their male parent? Daddy? Papa (which, incidentally, is Italian for Pope)? When they fill out a credit application, what do they put in the block which asks for their father's name - God? Obviously, there is meaning of this scriptural passage other than the literal one. This meaning is that there is only one Creator, from whom all ""fatherhood"" comes (Eph 3:14-15). This does not preclude addressing someone as ""father"", so long as you understand that all fatherhood (both biological and spiritual) originates with God the Father. We are all member's of God's family, a fact we acknowledge every time we recite the 'Our Father' or the Creed.\n\nSt. Paul calls himself a ""father"" in 1 Thessalonians 2:11 ""As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one you, as a father does his children."" (KJV) and again in 1 Corinthians 4:15 ""For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel."" (KJV). In both of these passages, St. Paul considers himself a spiritual father just as the priest is today. This same interpretation is presented by St. John in 1 Jn 2:13-14 where he says twice ""I write unto you, fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning."" (KJV).\n\nFinally, you might ask this individual if he or she is familiar with the New International Version (NIV) of the Bible (a common modern Protestant translation). If so, refer him or her to Matthew 23:10, the passage immediately after the one quoted to you: ""Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Messiah"". Even they have Sunday School teachers."

"2","can the mass weight of humans and relocated mass weight change abruptly the orbit of earth?","we are over populating with people in some areas, steel is being taken out of the soil, so its oil and other heavy items and distributed around the globe. could this unbalance the orbit of earth, like the tsunami did, the one that hit sri lanka and india.  what do you think?","not likely- no matter how many humans populate the planet, we make up  a very small fraction of the total mass of the earth,which is the same as it always was, since very little material has been removed from the earth since it was formed. The tsunami didn't affect the earth's orbit, it affected the rotation of the earth around its axis(sped it up by about one-billionth of a mile per hour) but didn't change the speed at which we travel around the sun(orbit) at all.no matter how we redistribute material around the planet we only change the weight distribution of the planet by a very,very small fraction so the effect will be unnoticable. the effect on this planet from human activity of any kind is much smaller than we think- greenhouse gas levels were far higher during the age of the dinosaurs than they are now (and humans didn't exist then). the amount of iron and other minerals we have taken out of the ground accounts for about onemillionth of a percent of the total amount still there. from out in space, you can't look at the earth and see anything that would suggest we live here, except the Great Wall of China and the light from our cities at night, so how great of an impact do we really have?"
"2","After the quake 26 dec 2004, What is the future of Andaman Islands  on Sumatra Andaman falt line?","What will be the effect of Andaman Islands due to quake.","""The Word "" ANDAMAN & NICOBAR ISLANDS & SUMATRA "" will be removed from the geographical area in another 10 million years since the eurasian plates are moving inch by inch .\n\nThe region where the great earthquake occurred on 26 December 2004, marks the seismic boundary formed by the movement of the Indo-Australian plate as it collides with the Burma subplate, which is part of the Eurasian plate. However, the Indo-Australian tectonic plate may not be as coherent as previously believed. According to recent studies reported in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters (vol 133), it apears that the two plates have separated many million years ago and that the Australian plate is rotating in a counterclockwise direction, putting stress in the southern segment of the India plate.\n\nFor millions of years the India tectonic plate has drifted and moved in a north/northeast direction, colliding with the Eurasian tectonic plate and forming the Himalayan mountains. As a result of such migration and collision with both the Eurasian and the Australian tectonic plates, the Indian plate's eastern boundary is a diffuse zone of seismicity and deformation, characterized by extensive faulting and numerous large earthquakes.\n\nThe epicenter of the 26 December 2004 earthquake was near the triple point junction of three tectonic plates where major earthquakes and tsunamis have occurred in the past.\n\nPrevious major earthquakes have occurred further north, in the Andaman Sea and further South along the Sumatra, Java and Sunda sections of one of the earth's greatest fault zones, a subduction zone known as the Sunda Trench. This great trench extends for about 3,400 miles (5,500 kms) from Myanmar (Burma) south past Sumatra and Java and east toward Australia and the Lesser Sunda Islands, ending up near Timor. Slippage and plate subduction make this region highly seismic. The volcanoes of Krakatau, Tambora and Toba, well known for their violent eruptions, are byproducts of such tectonic interactions.\n\nIn addition to the Sunda Trench, the Sumatra fault is responsible for seismic activity on the Island of Sumatra. This is a strike-slip type of fault which extends along the entire length of the island.\n\nThe Burma plate encompasses the northwest portion of the island of Sumatra as well as the Andaman and the Nicobar Islands, which separate the Andaman Sea from the Indian Ocean. Further to the east, a divergent boundary separates the Burma plate from the Sunda plate.\n\nMore specifically, in the region off the west coast of northern Sumatra, the India plate is moving in a northeastward direction at about 5 to 5.5 cm per year relative to the Burma plate.\n\nChronological Sequence of Major Aftershocks Along the West Coast of Northern Sumatra and in the Nicobar and Andaman Island Region Following the Major Earthquake om 26 December 2004\n\n\n MAGNITUDE   DATE  UTC-TIME  LATITUDE  LONGITUDE  DEPTH  REGION \n              \n 8.9  2004/12/26  00:58:51  3.298  95.779  10.0 West Coast of Northern Sumatra \n 5.9  2004/12/26  01:48:47  5.393  94.423  10.0 West Coast of Northern Sumatra \n 5.8  2004/12/26  02:15:58  12.375  92.509  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 6.0  2004/12/26  02:22:02  8.83  92.532  10.0  Nicobar Islands \n 5.8  2004/12/26  02:34:50  4.104  94.184  10.0 West Coast of Northern Sumatra \n 5.8  2004/12/26  02:36:06  12.139  93.011  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 6.0  2004/12/26  02:51:59  12.511  92.592  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 5.9  2004/12/26  02:59:12  3.177  94.259  10.0 West Coast of Northern Sumatra \n 6.1  2004/12/26  03:08:42  13.808  92.974  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 7.3  2004/12/26  04:21:26  6.901  92.952  10.0  Nicobar Islands \n 5.7  2004/12/26  06:21:58  10.623  92.323  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 5.7  2004/12/26  07:07:10  10.336  93.756  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 5.8  2004/12/26  07:38:25  13.119  93.051  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 6.5  2004/12/26  09:20:01  8.867  92.382  10.0  Nicobar Islands \n 6.2  2004/12/26  10:19:30  13.455  92."

"2","Where in the body you can't inject lidocaine with epinephren?","","I assume you meant epinephrine. Regardless, lidocaine/epinephrine injections, such as AstraZeneca's Xylocaine, should only be administered by a medical professional. He/she will know where the drug can and cannot be administered. I am not a physician nor a clinician. Therefore, I am not going to give medical advice. However, the information below (all obtained from Xylocaine's Prescribing Information) should answer your question:\n\nFor normal healthy adults, the individual maximum recommended dose of lidocaine HCl with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose not exceed 500 mg.\n\nXylocaine (lidocaine HCl) Injections are indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks.\n\nXYLOCAINE INJECTIONS FOR INFILTRATION AND NERVE BLOCK SHOULD BE EMPLOYED ONLY BY CLINICIANS WHO ARE WELL VERSED IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY AND OTHER ACUTE EMERGENCIES THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM THE BLOCK TO BE EMPLOYED AND THEN ONLY AFTER ENSURING THE IMMEDIATE AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN, OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS, CARDIOPULMONARY EQUIPMENT AND THE PERSONNEL NEEDED FOR PROPER MANAGEMENT OF TOXIC REACTIONS AND RELATED EMERGENCIES. DELAY IN PROPER MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY, UNDERVENTILATION FROM ANY CAUSE AND/OR ALTERED SENSITIVITY MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACIDOSIS, CARDIAC ARREST AND, POSSIBLY, DEATH.\n\nTo avoid intravascular injection, aspiration should be performed before the local anesthetic solution is injected. The needle must be repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by aspiration. Note, however, that the absence of blood in the syringe does not guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided.\n\nLocal anesthetic solutions containing antimicrobial preservatives, (eg, methylparaben) should not be used for epidural or spinal anesthesia because the safety of these agents has not been established with regard to intrathecal injection, either intentional or accidental.\n\nXylocaine with epinephrine solutions contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."

"2","how is wind fomed?","","Quite simply it is pressure differences that create the phenomena that we call wind.\n\nAir moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. It is trying to ""balance"". The greater the pressure difference, the stronger the wind.\n\nWind direction is determined by where highs & lows are located. Since high moves in to replace low, that is how you will know which way it will move.\n\nThe sun is the ultimate ""driving force"" for the creation of wind. When the earth is unevenly heated it creates differences in pressure. Areas w/ more heat will tend to form low pressure b/c of rising air. Colder air tends to sink so it increases the amount of pressure exerted on us. This is called high pressure.\n\nModel of wind formation:\nSea Breezes occur when low pressure cells form over land during the day (warm air rising/low pressure); Meanwhile, pressure is higher over the ocean (b/c it is cooler here). Since the pressure is higher over the ocean, it will move from there to where it is rising (over land). Voila! Instant sea breeze.\n\n:)"

"2","box and whisker plots?","how do you pick out the numbers to use with a box and whisker plot when you have all the quartiles, and smallest and largest numbers?","A box-and-whisker plot can be useful for handling many data values. They allow people to explore data and to draw informal conclusions when two or more variables are present. It shows only certain statistics rather than all the data. Five-number summary is another name for the visual representations of the box-and-whisker plot. The five-number summary consists of the median, the quartiles, and the smallest and greatest values in the distribution. Immediate visuals of a box-and-whisker plot are the center, the spread, and the overall range of distribution.\n \n\n\nThe first step in constructing a box-and-whisker plot is to first find the median, thelower quartile and the upper quartile of a given set of data. Example: The following set of numbers are the amount of marbles fifteen different boys own (they are arranged from least to greatest).\n\n18 27 34 52 54 59 61 68 78 82 85 87 91 93 100\n \n\n\nFirst find the median. The median is the value exactly in the middle of an ordered set of numbers. *\n\n68 is the median\n\nNext, we consider only the values to the left of the median: 18 27 34 52 54 59 61. We now find the median of this set of numbers. Remember, the median is the value exactly in the middle oa an ordered set of numbers. Thus 52 is the median of the scores less than the median of all scores, and therefore is the lower quartile.\n\n52 is the lower quartile\n\nNow consider only the values to the right of the median: 78 82 85 87 91 93 100. We now find the median of this set of numbers. The median 87 is therefore called the upper quartile. \n\n87 is the upper quartile\n\n(*If you're finding the median in an ordered set with an even number of values, you must take the average of the two middle numbers. For example: 3, 5, 7, and 10. Add the two middle numbers. 5 + 7 = 12. Divided 12 by 2 to get the average. 12 / 2 = 6. Therefore 6 is the median for the ordered set of 3, 5, 7, and 10.)\n\nYou are now ready to find the interquartile range (IQR). The interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile. In our case the IQR = 87 - 52 = 35. The IQR is a very useful measurement. It is useful because it is less influenced by extreme values, it limits the range to the middle 50% of the values.\n\n35 is the interquartile range\n\nplease review these pages."

"2","what is the mechanism of leukocyte impairment in diabetics ?","","Leukocyte-Derived Myeloperoxidase Amplifies High-Glucose—Induced Endothelial Dysfunction Through Interaction With High-Glucose—Stimulated, Vascular Non—Leukocyte-Derived Reactive Oxygen Species \nChunxiang Zhang, Jian Yang, and Lisa K. Jennings \nFrom the Vascular Biology Center of Excellence, Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee \n\nVascular non–leukocyte-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), have emerged as important molecules in diabetic endothelial dysfunction. In addition, leukocyte-derived myeloperoxidase (MPO) has been implicated in vascular injury, and its injury response is H2O2 dependent. It is well known that MPO can use leukocyte-derived H2O2; however, it is unknown whether the vascular-bound MPO can use high-glucose–stimulated, vascular non–leukocyte-derived H2O2 to induce diabetic endothelial dysfunction. In the present study, we demonstrated that MPO activity is increased in vessels from diabetic rats. In high-glucose–incubated rat aortas and in carotid arteries from rats with acute hyperglycemia, vascular-bound MPO utilized high-glucose–stimulated H2O2 to amplify the ROS-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation via reduction of nitric oxide bioavailability. Hypochlorous acid (HOCL)-modified LDL, a specific biomarker for the MPO/HOCL/chlorinating species pathway, was detected in LDL- and MPO-bound vessels with high-glucose–stimulated H2O2. The results suggest that vascular-bound MPO could use high-glucose–stimulated H2O2 to amplify high-glucose–induced injury in the vascular wall. MPO/H2O2/HOCL/chlorinating species may represent an important pathway in diabetes complications and a new mechanism in phagocyte- and systemic infection–induced exacerbation of diabetic vascular diseases. \n\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Chunxiang Zhang, MD, PhD, Vascular Biology Center of Excellence, Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, 956 Court Ave., Coleman Bldg., H300, Memphis, TN 38163.

Especially when black people seem use these phrases between themselves.","Jeff A, take off your pointed hood and open your eyes.\nLet's look at it from a bigger picture and ask ourselves a couple of questions.\nWhat percentage of the Global population living under the poverty line is black, asian, colored?\nNo matter how you look at it, there is a corelation between the color of skin and prevalence of poverty.\nNow, slavery and colonialism have various debilitating effects. These effects take a lot of time to heal. Every civilization in the past has at one time or the other had slaves from other conquered cultures e.g Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Nevetheless, in none of these cases has the proportion of slaves to citizens come close to the prevalence of the United States. At the height of slavery in the US, there was 1 african slave for every 4 citizen.\nIn the case of previous civilizations, the negative effects of slavery have been greatly healed by the passage of time. It has been barely a century since slavery was abolished in the US, and just a copule of decades since civil right reforms were implemented in the south. It is over optimistic, to the point of naivette, to assume that societal and racial relations in the US would be normalized after only a copule of decades.\nThis brings to mind a skit in an episode of ""Family Guy"" where a colonial white man removes the shackles from his african slave and says ""Okay, its over now. We're cool, right?"".\nIt is understandable that minorities unconsciously feel slighted about the past and wish to strike back. In roman history, an army of escaped and former slaves led the Thracean Spartacus led a bloody revolt against the Roman populace.\nIn modern US society, It is sometimes taken as a subconscious mental victory that it is politically incorrect for a white person to say ""Ni99er"" while black people can refer to each other that way. These irrelevant mental victories help to heal racial problems in the society.\nBeing born and raised for the first 20 years of my life in a West African country, I have the advantage of being able to look at the US society from an outsiders perspective.\nFor anyone who says that the current US society is racially fair, I ask them to research the average family income for a black, hispanic, asian then caucasian family. Numbers dont lie, but ultimately, time heals all wounds (hopefully)."

"2","What is uranium used for?","","As uranium metal is very dense and heavy, depleted uranium is used by some militaries as shielding to protect tanks, and also in parts of bullets, kinetic energy penetrators and missiles. The military also uses enriched uranium (more than natural levels of 235U) to power nuclear propelled navy ships and submarines, and in nuclear weapons. Fuel used for United States Navy reactors is typically highly enriched in 235U.In nuclear weapons uranium is also highly enriched, usually over 90%  to a level known as ""weapons grade"".\n\nThe main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel commercial nuclear power plants, where fuel is typically enriched in 235U to 2-3%. However, the Canadian Candu reactors use natural uranium (i.e.unenriched) as fuel. Depleted uranium is used in helicopters and airplanes as counterweights on certain wing parts. Other uses include;\n\nCeramic glazes where small amounts of natural uranium (that is, not having gone through the enrichment process) may be added for colour. \nAddition of uranium makes fluorescent yellow or green coloured glass. \nThe long half-life of the isotope 238U (4.51 × 109 years) make it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating (including uranium-thorium dating and uranium-lead dating). \n238U is converted into plutonium in breeder reactors. Plutonium can be used in reactors, or in nuclear weapons. \nUranyl acetate, UO2(CH3COO)2 is used in analytical chemistry. It forms an insoluble salt with sodium. \nSome lighting fixtures utilise uranium, as do some photographic chemicals (esp. uranium nitrate). \nPhosphate fertilisers often contain high amounts of natural uranium, because the mineral material from which they are made is typically high in uranium. \nUranium metal is used for X-ray targets in making of high-energy X-rays"

I wonder how can I avoid this situation.Thank you.","A brief explanation of what's going on - in the dry weather, you're building up static electricity on your body as you walk around. When you touch a metal object (like a doorknob) that has very little electric charge, the charge is transferred to the other object.\n\nSo, the short answer is that to prevent the annoying shocks, you need to avoid building up electricity, or keep discharging it to objects. Touching metal frequently will help. Also, you can avoid some of the annoying effects by touching things with something other than your fingertips first - for example, the back of your hand. Your fingertips are very sensitive, and it may not be as unpleasant to get small shocks on other parts of your body."

In Christian theology sin is anything that separates us from God, other people or ourselves.  It is not, as some think, a list of thou shall nots.  One person's sin may not be another's, up to a point of course. The basis of the Law of Moses is the 10 commandments. And Jesus taught us that there are 2 things that we must do.  We are to love God, and love our neighbor. \n\nThere are some problem with mixed marriages from a  sociological POV. This is true for race, religion, social class, and culture.  It is easier to live with someone that is more like us and raised with the same social expectations and so on. Marriage is not easy, especially as children come along and you have different ideas of how they should be raised.

It is well known that external radiation (for example, gamma rays or x-rays) can cause all of the thyroid problems listed above. It is also known that internal exposure from radioactive iodine can cause hypothyroidism. However, it is still uncertain, due to the relatively few scientific studies that have been done, whether radioactive iodine (I-131) causes thyroid tumors in humans."

"2","How do pesticides work?","Specifically, how do rodenticides and insecticides kill pests?  Am I limited to which ones I as a layman can buy for private use?  Are their any controls in place?",">>>>Specifically, how do rodenticides and insecticides kill pests?\n\nIf you want specificity I suggest you find a website that describes the mode of action. You are looking at a minimum of 10, 00 words if you want specifics, and no one is going to post 10, 00 words here.\n\nIn vaguely general terms however common rodenticides work by preventing the blood from clotting. This leads to bleeding into the joints and into the organs, and ultimately causes death from dehydration.\n\nInsecticides work by causing the nerves to fire continuously. That in turn causes the muscles to contract uncontrollably. The constant muscle contraction causes the insect  to die of exhauation.\n\n>>>>Am I limited to which ones I as a layman can buy for private use?\n\nYes, every state has its own restrictions on what licences are required for which pesticides. For example you can not but arsenic or fluoroacetate in any state as a layman although they are common commercial insecticides and rodenticides respectively.\n\n>>>Are their any controls in place?\n\nYes. In most states there are lists of restricted pesticides available only to licenced professionals. The restrictions and lists vary. You need to produce a licence to obtain the restricted substances."

People write prayers and wishes and leave the note in between the stones, as it is believed that they will come true.\nWhen Israel was in Arab hands the Western Wall was turned into a garbage dump, but when Israel took back Jerusalem in 1967, the wall was cleaned up, and access to it was allowed to everyone."

It obviously depends on the compaction of the snow and the crystal structure. \n\nBy my calculations the commercial snowmaking machines use about 5 inches of water to one foot of snow, so it is obviously much denser than natural snow."

OR okay, she can be scared that her g/f will try and kill herself (again). Bottom line, that girl is controling your friends life and its a very bad situation. Tell your friend to seek professional advice on how to get out of that relationship. She is being emotionally abused and needs to get out ASAP. Tell your girlfriend to call a hotline, get advice on how to leave and then just be there for her during the transition and so forth. IF your friend refuses to try harder and at least another month goes by then yes, move on. It may be very hard but at this rate its not fair to you. Good luck!"

"2","Why does life expectancy depend on where you live?","","The single biggest factor responsible for the correlation between life expectancy location is available medical care.\n\nThe vast majority of people in this world do not have access to even basic medical. If you live in many countries and you cut yourself badly, there is a good chance you will die simply because there are no doctors for thousands of miles around. The cut will become infected you will die, as simple as that.\n\nThink about it, have you ever had an operation in your life, like having your appendix removed? Ever had to take antibiotics? Ever had a wound stitched? If so then if you lived in much of the world there is a good chance you would now be dead. You wouldn’t have been able to get that degree of medical care.\n\nThen we look at other factors. Many countries don’t have any effective workplace safety rules. If you don’t; want to starve you have to do what you are told, even if it could kill you. Many countries have dirty drinking water supplies a which cause fatal diseases and so on and on.\n\nThat is why life expectancy correlates so well with location. When you add up all those factors there are places in this world where most people die before they turn 30.\n\n\nThis has nothing whatsoever to do with pollution and very little to do with diet. Diet these days is fairly trivial, and pollution causes so few deaths that it is almost impossible to detect statistically."

"2","why is the sky blue??","","The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.\n\nAs you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white."

At least a possible one.\n\nI went to Harlem and walked around for a couple of hours. I happend to come across the ""Uptown Saterday Nite"" Festival which is part of the 2005 Harlem Week. Nothing sensational but on the corner of 135th Street and 7th Avenue I noticed this old red building with a sign showing an upside down apple saying ""The Big Apple"". I took a photograph and went on.\nAfter coming home I did a little research on the internet, looking for this particular sign in Harlem. That's how I found out about the history of this sign and New Yorks nickname.\n\nIn the 1920's Jazz musicians picked the term ""Big Apple"" up from horseracing people who considered New York races and gigs to be where the big money was. Since a horse, up for a big purse in New York City, can't get paid off in big money himself, the lingo promised him a big apple. At this time a night club opened in Harlem called ""The Big Apple"". Some historians think that New Yorks nickname may have come from this long forgotten club. The club is gone, the sign, with its upside down apple, is still there.\n\nFor another theory you may want to read this article from the Society for New York City History."

"2","What is genetic counseling?","Its for a science project. Is it just predicting what traits your baby will have or does it even involve chaing the baby's traits through Gene therapy?","Genetic Counseling has three main purposes.  The first is the testing of individuals for known genetic disorders, and then counseling these individuals about their options if they are susceptible to a given disorder, or cary a gene that can be passed down to their kids for this disorder.\n\nThe second purpose is to gather information about individuals with disorders and, with the patients permission, place that information into large databases along with scientific tests in order to help scientists understand the disease better from a genetic, and molecular, standpoint.\n\nThe last purpose is to gather information from individuals with a known disorder, but for which the causative genes are not well understood.  This includes lots of blood work, as well as gathering family information (and if possible samples from the family) to search out more information about these disorders.\n\nCounseling, as it stands now in america, can give you information about what your child may or may not have, and the chances that the child will show a given trait, but this is almost always relating to a genetic disorder.  As of yet, almsot no information is tested to look at ""hair color"" or anything else not life altering or threatening.\n\nSome disorders are able to attack using gene therapy, though almost all therapies used so far are minimally successfull at best.  \n\nTo put it simply, genetic counseling is about getting people ready for the consequences of having a child with sepcial needs, and allowing them time and opportunity to get ready for those needs.  It very rarely includes ways of ""curing"" these diseases using genetic therapies, though hopefully with the advent of stem cell research and retroviral therapies, this can change."
"2","What was the day on 15th August 1947???? Plzz tell me the solution..?","What i want to know is how to find the day of any given date and year???","Okay, this is not going to be pretty, but it works, but only for years from A.D. 1582 and later.\n\nFirst, let M equal the number corresponding to the chosen month according to the following list\n\nJan=11\nFeb=12\nMar=1\nApr=2\nMay=3\nJune=4\nJuly=5\nAug=6\nSep=7\nOct=8\nNov=9\nDec=10\n\nNext, let N equal the day of the month for which you are inquiring.  So if you want to look for August 15, M would be 6 and N would be 15 (M=6, N=15).\n\nNow, take the last two digits from the year you are searching for, call that number Y.  For 1947, Y=47.\n\nThe leftover digits of the year make a new number, call it C.  For 1947, after removing 47 we see that C=19.\n\nFinally, if the year is a leap year, let L=1, otherwise, let L=0.\n\nNow we're ready to get down to business.  The following formula makes use of the greatest integer function (ipart) which essentially means that if you get some number with a decimal, chop off the decimal.  3698.2461 becomes 3698.  OK?  Good.\n\nNow we must calculate the following formula:\nN + ipart(2.6M - 0.2) + Y + ipart(Y/4) + ipart(C/4) - 2C - (1 + L)*ipart(M/11)\n\nAfter calculating this number, divide it by seven and look at the remainder.  The remainder corresponds to the day of the week as follows:\n\n0=Sunday\n1=Monday\n2=Tuesday\n3=Wednesday\n4=Thursday\n5=Friday\n6=Saturday\n\nLet's test this with your August 15, 1947.\n\nSo, M=6, N=15, Y=47, C=19, and since 1947 was not a leap year, L=0.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula we get:\n15 + ipart(2.6*6 - 0.2) + 47 + ipart(47/4) + ipart(19/4) - 2*19 - (1 + 0)*ipart(6/11)\n\n=15 + ipart(15.4) + 47 + ipart(11.75) + ipart(4.75) - 38 - 1*ipart(.5454545454)\n\n=15 + 15 + 47 + 11 + 4 - 38 - 0\n\n=54\n\nDividing this by 7, we get a remainder of 5.\n\nThis says that August 15, 1947, was a Friday."
"2","How would I write this in a quadratic function for this parabola?","the maximum value is 6\nx intercepts are -2 and 4\nplease show how!","Here is how:  The axis of symmetry occurs halfway between the x-intercepts.  That is x = 1.  So the vertex is (1,6).\n\nThe vertex form of a parabola's equation is y = a(x-h)^2 + k\nwhere (h,k) is the vertex.\n\nSo we know it's y = a(x-1)^2 + 6\n\nFinally to find a, plug in the known coordinates of a point other than the vertex, say (4,0) since those are the coordinates of an x-intercept.\n\n0 = a(4-1)^2 + 6\n\n0 = 9a + 6\n\na = -6/9 or -2/3\n\nSo the equation is y = -2/3 (x-1)^2 + 6\n\nIf you need a different form, multiply it out but this should suffice.  Hope that helps explain what to do."

"2","explain the difference between a protostome and a deuterostome?","","Protostomes (from the Greek: first the mouth) are a taxon of animals. Together with the deuterostomes and a few smaller phyla, they make up the Bilateria, mostly comprising animals with bilateral symmetry and three germ layers. The major distinctions between deuterostomes and protostomes are found in embryonic development. In protostome development, the first opening in development, the blastopore, becomes its mouth. In deuterostome development, the blastopore becomes the animal's anus. Protostomes have what is known as spiral cleavage which is determinate, this meaning that the fate of the cells is determined as they are formed. This is in contrast to deuterostomes which have radial cleavage that is indeterminate.\n\nDeuterostomes (taxonomic term: Deuterostomia; from the Greek: ""second mouth"") are a superphylum of animals. They are a subtaxon of the Bilateria branch of the subregnum Eumetazoa, and are opposed to the protostomes. Deuterostomes are distinguished by their embryonic development; in deuterostomes, the first opening (the blastopore) becomes the anus, while in protostomes it becomes the mouth.\n\nThere are three phyla of deuterostomes:\n\n    * Phylum Chordata (vertebrates and their kin)\n    * Phylum Echinodermata (starfishes, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, etc.)\n    * Phylum Hemichordata (acorn worms and possibly graptolites)\n\nThe phylum Chaetognatha (arrow worms) and the isolated genus Xenoturbella may also belong here. Extinct groups may include the phylum Vetulicolia. The term Ambulacraria is sometimes used for the phyla Echinodermata and Hemichordata, as well as Xenoturbella.\n\nIn both deuterostomes and protostomes, a zygote first develops into a hollow ball of cells, called a blastula. In deuterostomes, the early divisions occur parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis. This is called radial cleavage, and also occurs in certain protostomes, such as the lophophorates. Cleavage is indeterminate - the cells' fates are not determined early on. Thus if the first four cells are separated, each cell is capable of forming a complete small larva, and if a cell is removed from the blastula the other cells will compensate.\n\nIn deuterostomes the mesoderm forms as evaginations of the developed gut that pinch off, forming the coelom. This is called enterocoely.\n\nBoth the Hemichordata and Chordata have gill slits, and primitive fossil echinoderms also show signs of gill slits. A hollow nerve cord is found in all chordates, even tunicates (even if it disappears in the adults). Some hemichordates also have a tubular nerve cord. In early embryonic stage it looks like the hollow nerve cord of chordates. Because of the degenerated nervous system of echinoderms it is not possible to discern much about their ancestors in this matter, but based on different facts it is quite possible that all the present deuterostomes evolved from a common ancestor which had gill slits, a hollow nerve cord and a segmented body. It could have resembled the small group of Cambrian deuterostomes named Vetulicolia."

"2","what is op-amp.state the application?","","An OP amp is short for Operational Amplifier. This thing can be used for many applications in the electronics field.  Basically, an OP amp is comparable to a single transistor except that an OP amp has 2 inputs. One input can except positive input, and the other input accepts negative signal. OP amps have high input impedance in the order of 1megaohm or more. The output impedance is in the order of roughly around 75 ohms. You can use it as an open or closed loop -- meaning that the output of an OP amp is fed back to either the negative or positive input. One thing about OP amp is that it has infinitely high output gain when operated as open loop, whereas in close loop you can adjust your gain via using a larger resistor on the feedback loop line. The gain is determined by feedback resistor divided by input resistor. Is this too deep for you? Let me back up a little.\n\nAn OP amp can be used as an audio amplier, or RF amplier. \nIt is widely used in practically every application whether it is a car stereo, TV, home stereo, computer, and just about anything that involves electronics nowadays."

"2","how does knowledge of principles of physics help in understanding plate tectonics?","","Plate tectonics is deeply connected with physics, and was discovered by geophysicists using techniques from physics.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Fluid mechanics\n2. continuum mechanics\n3. electromagnetism\n4. newton's laws\n\nPlate tectonics was discovered by looking at stripes of magnetization on the sea floor. These are from the earth's field, which is caused by a dynamo, which is very complicated physics, involving electromagnetism and fluid mechanics. The plates move because of entrainment by moving fluids beneath. There is a lot of thermodynamics involved in the heat transfer and the cooling of the plates after they emerge from a midcean ridge; they contract as they cool. There is continuum mechanics involved in the deformation of the plates as they collide or get subducted. Islands on the plate surface can cause the plates to flex, and this is studied by continuum mechanics. One could make a very extensive list, that would probably include quantum mechanics, and even nuclear physics (which creates the heat that drives the plates), and only exclude quantum effects."

What tells the atomic structure of rubber to bounce and concrete to, well, to NOT!\n\nTo me, to deny the idea of intelligent design is much more of a leap than to accept the obvious, evident truth all around us that although chaos exists all around us, if you look deep enough there is most definitely order and intelligence in the universe. God may not be the man in the Bible but God most definitely rules the universe at the atomic level.....so, no, similarities between species means nothing more than that, similarities...."
"1","Can someone give me examples and the meaning of the indicative and subjunctive mood?","Is conditional, and imperfect moods too? If so, what do they mean?","The subjunctive mood is used to talk about imaginary or unreal situations or a desire like ""If I were an animal I would be a dog""...you're obviously not an animal and never will be...and you're right it is often used in conditional sentences...another case of subjunctive is when it's used with wish like ""I wish I were a millionaire"" or ""I wish I had lots of money""...In English you use the past tense to form the subjunctive and if you need to use the verb to be, use ""were"" with all pronouns (I were, he were, she were, we were, etc) although when speaking many people say ""If I was""...\n\nThe conditional mood is the one that expresses lack of certainty and it occurs especially but no only in conditional sentences.  There are five types of conditional\n\nthe zero conditional expresses a situations that's always true or often happen, for example ""If I have a headache I take an aspirin""\n\nthe first conditional expresses a situation which is likely to happen in the future, for example, ""If it rains this afternoon I won't go out""\n\nthe second conditional is about a situation which is unreal or unlikely to happen, like ""If I became the president of the US, I would abolish taxes""\n\nthe third conditional talks about a past situation which has already happened and therefore it's impossible to change, like ""If I had gone to the party yesterday I would have had lots of fun""\n\nthe mixed conditional is similar to the third only that the consequence of the action is still visible in the present like, ""If penicillin hadn't been discovered, many people would die from infections""\n\nThe indicative mood is the one we use to establish a fact or something that is true like ""The Earth is round"". ""I am a student"", ""I went to a party yesterday""...It's the most commonly used mood and there is an indicative form for present, past and future\n\nThere is no such thing as the imperfect mood...the imperfect is a verb tense, although it is not called so in English...the English equivalents to other languages' imperfect tense are for example I was eating or I used to eat, that is, the past progressive, etc...in English only the subjunctive has an imperfect form which is the one I explained to you before (I were, she were, etc) as oppossed to the present subjunctive which is not very common and can be seen in sentences like ""She requests that he come to the meeting tomorrow""...as you can see the -s is not used with the third person in this case...\n\nok I hope I was clear enough, please let me know if you still have any doubts!"

"2","How do birds fly long distances without flapping their wings?","","Once birds get up in the air, they use two main flying techniques to stay up there.\n\nSoaring: When birds soar, they take advantage air currents to help hold them up. Three kinds of air currents are especially helpful to soaring birds. \n\nThermal air currents develop in places where the air is warmer in one spot than an adjoining area, such as a paved road alongside a snowy field. Even on a very cold day, the sun will heat the pavement at least a few degrees more than the snow. This slightly warmer air is slightly lighter than the colder air, and rises. This rising air current can lift very light objects, like feathers and hollow bones. The birds that most often take advantage of thermals (like the hawks that fly along coastlines) usually have very wide wings and tail. This makes the area of their wings very large compared to their body weight. \nUpdrafts, also called obstruction currents, develop when wind hits an obstruction, like a cliff or a building. The rushing air has to go somewhere, so it goes up, and can carry a bird up with it. Birds who fly on updrafts (like the many hawks that migrate along Hawk Mountain, Pennsylvania) also have very wide wings and tail. \nWind moving toward a bird with spread wings can hold the bird up, thanks to the airfoil shape of the wings. Birds that fly on moving air currents often have long, narrow wings, such as gulls and albatrosses. \n  \n \nFlapping: When birds flap, the stroke of their downbeat moves the wing tips forward and downward. The wingtips make a loop at the bottom of the downstroke, and as the wings move up, the wing tips move upward and backward. In the downstroke, the pressure is higher below the wing than above, causing lift. And as they move forward, the rush of air on their airfoil wings causes more lift. But because flapping birds have smaller wings than soaring birds, they must move forward faster to stay in the air. Most songbirds must fly at least 11 miles per hour to stay up. One scientist calculated that for an ostrich to stay aloft, it would have to take off and maintain a minimum speed of 100 miles per hour. Birds who use their wings to flap more than soar often have smaller wings than soaring birds."

Since this seems to be more about general communication than actual speeches, its a lot less formal most of the time. If you are worried that people will make fun of you, try to stay current with whatever is going on in the group your involved in. If you are in a group of people who like movies, you know that if you havent looked up movies in a while you might be a bit out of place. Theres no real set science to being able to talk in groups. It really does help to be comfortable with your views and opinons. People usually want to hear other peoples opinions. A lot of times people feel nervous talking in groups but if you start getting involved you find that people will be affirming and it gets a little easier. Im not saying you have to be the life of the party right away. If someone says something you agree with, say that you feel the same way. Take baby steps. Soon you might feel a little more comfortable as people are a little more positive. Just keep working at it, and dont get frusterated if you end up saying something a little silly at times, because we all do."

"1","Where did AIDS come from and do you think there is a cure somewhere that hasn't been exposed?","This question came from my friend insisting that AIDS is a man made disease (which I believe) and that Majic Johnson has the cure. Some person told me it came from a monkey another said from gay people (although I absolutely don't believe). What do you think?","I thought this was an amazing article. It was just published a few days ago:\n\nWASHINGTON - Twenty-five years after the first AIDS cases emerged, scientists have confirmed that the HIV virus plaguing humans really did originate in wild chimpanzees, in a corner of Cameroon.\n\nSolving the mystery of HIV’s ancestry was dirty work. Scientists employed trackers to plunge through dense jungle and collect the fresh feces of wild apes — more than 1,300 samples in all.\n\nBefore that, it took seven years of research just to develop the testing methods to genetically trace the primate version of the virus in living wild chimps without hurting the endangered species.\n\nUntil now, “no one was able to look. No one had the tools,” said Dr. Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. She led the team of international researchers that reported the success in Friday’s edition of the journal Science.\n\n“We’re 25 years into this pandemic,” Hahn said. “We don’t have a cure. We don’t have a vaccine. But we know where it came from. At least we can make a check mark on one of those.”\n\nScientists long have known that nonhuman primates carry their own version of the AIDS virus, called SIV or simian immunodeficiency virus. But with one exception, it had been found only in captive chimpanzees, particularly a subspecies that in the wild populates mostly West Africa.\n\nIt was not known how prevalent the virus was in chimps in the wild, or how genetically or geographically diverse it was, complicating efforts to pin down the jump from animal to man.\n\nHahn’s team tested chimp feces for SIV antibodies, finding them in a subspecies called Pan troglodytes troglodytes in southern Cameroon.\n\nChimps tend to form geographically distinct communities. By genetically analyzing the feces, researchers could trace individual infected chimps. The team found some chimp communities with infection rates as high as 35 percent, while others had no infection at all.\n\nEvery single infected chimp had a common base genetic pattern that indicated a common ancestor, Hahn said.\n\nThere are three types of HIV-1, the strain of the human virus responsible for most of the worldwide epidemic. Genetic analysis let Hahn identify chimp communities near Cameroon’s Sanaga River whose viral strains are most closely related to the most common of those HIV-1 subtypes.\n\n“The genetic similarity was striking,” Hahn said.\n\nThe first human known to be infected with HIV was a man from Kinshasa in the nearby country of Congo who had his blood stored in 1959 as part of a medical study, decades before scientists knew the AIDS virus existed.\n\nPresumably, someone in rural Cameroon was bitten by a chimp or was cut while butchering one and became infected with the ape virus. That person passed it to someone else.\n\nThe Sanaga River long has been a commercial waterway, for transporting hardwood, ivory and other items to more urban areas. Eventually, someone infected made it to Kinshasa.\n\n“How many different transmission events occurred between that initial hunter and this virus making it to Kinshasa, I don’t know. It could have been one, it could have been 10, it could have been 100,” Hahn said. “Eventually, it ended up in an urban area, and that’s where it really got going.”\n\nSomewhere in all that spread, the virus became more deadly to people than it is to chimps, who seldom are bothered much by SIV.\n\nThe research seems to settle any question of HIV’s origin, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health’s AIDS chief.\n\nWhen tracing a virus’ evolution, “it’s important to get as close to the source as you can,” he said. “It’s of historic interest.”"

This value is denoted by the letter c, reputedly from the Latin celeritas, ""speed"". Note that this speed is a definition, not a measurement, since the fundamental SI unit of distance, the metre, has been defined since 1983 in terms of the speed of light—one metre is the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. The speed of light through a transparent medium (that is, not in vacuum) is less than c; the ratio of c to this speed is called the refractive index of the medium."

He will break the cross, kill the pigs and become a just Judge."" \n\nSome Muslim scholars interpretation on this saying is: ""Jesus will not  break the cross one by one and also kill the pigs one by one which is quite impossible but rather it signifies that people will turn into the folds of Islam in abundance leaving their old beliefs. He will then become a worldly Judge for humans not of his own will but of the will of He who send him which is Almighty God.""\n\nHope this answers your question."

Heat is actually the motion (really kinetic energy) of atoms (since we're talking about an element).  Lower heat (and lower temperature) mean less motion.\n\n-273 C (or 0 degrees Kelvin) is known as ""absolute zero"".  It is the temperature at which that heat motion stops and kinetic energy goes to zero.  Since an atom cannot have negative motion or negative mass, its kinetic also cannot be zero and therefor its temperature cannot be less than absolute zero."

Another train leaves Point B heading toward Point A at 6:20AM at a constant speed of 40 kph.  What time do the two trains meet?","Ok, first you want to see where they meet. To make this easier, advance train A for 5/6ths of an hour and see the problem in terms of when train B starts out. 65 x 5/6= 325/6\nkilometers. So the problem is the same only they start out at the same time over a distance of 600- 325/6 kilometer =\n545 5/6 kilometers.\n\nNow, they travel in the proportion of 65/105 kilometers per hour.

"1","anyone know how to learn how to see ghost or spirits?","","In my opinion it is impossible to teach yourself to see ghosts, you either can or you can't (and I know a couple of people who can, including myself when I was younger, the former owner of my parents house, which he build, doesn't want to leave, and he's a fairly nice old man).  \n\nI will argue that all ghost are not demonic spirits, yes, some are are really, really bad (like the one is my sister's apartment in State College, PA, he stalked my sister's roommate in certain instances, which is how I found out she can see ghosts), but for the most part there is as much a mix of good spirits to malevolent spirits as there are to good people vs. malevolent people. \nNow, you can experience ghosts with out being able to see them.  Before I go any futher I have to say, there is no scientific evidence that either confirms or denies the existence of ghosts, spirits, whatever you want to call them.  Having personal experience with instance that are within keeping of arguements made toward the existence of ghosts (yeah I know that is hard to read, but i can't phrase it much better), I happen to belive in them.  Since ghosts take space they have a subtance, while this substance is generally not visible to the average person, the electromagnatic patterns show up on pictures, including digital cameras.  So, if you think you have a ghost take a bunch of pictures, they will show up as a ball of light, where there is nothing.  However, I wouldn't recommend using a cell phone cam because the resolution of those suck, so distortion for bright lights in the background may interfere with an accurate picture.  See the source for tips to photograph them.\n\nI will agree with the statement that if even if you could learn to see them, you don't want want to.  There is nothing scarier then seeing a pure black spirits (one that is completely evil).  Yes, if you have the ability to see them, most of them are a shade of grey.  The color spectrum is  from pure white (good) to pure black (evil), most of them are a shade of grey, though I never remember seeing a pure white spirit, a couple that were a really light shades of grey, but never white.  Just in case you are wondering, it was around the age of 12-13 that I could no longer see ghosts, though I can stil ""sense"" most spirits."

Our animal instincts still affect us, even though it's not apparent.

Sutra signfies a thread, or discourse threaded on a series of aphorisms. Sutra was a standard term for a technical text, thus also the Yogasutram of Patanjali. The text is originally known as Vatsyayana Kamasutram (""Vatsyayana's Aphorisms on Love""). Tradition holds that the author was a celibate scholar.

"2","what is the difference between mummification and freezing?","","I agree w/ eggman.\n\nMummification has to do w/ drying out as a means of preservation. But it doesn't always have to be dried out. Sometimes it is done as a form of burial which is a good method of isolation from the reaches of bacteria when done in the right setting. The bog bodies of Great Britain & other parts of Europe are a great example.\n\nThe 'bog bodies' are awesome specimens of mummification. If you haven't seen them then you should Google it. Their bodies were preserved well, some with the hair & wardrobe still intact. That is pretty neat considering some, but not all, of these bodies are from the Bronze Age.\n\nI love to PowerPoint pictures of them & show my students. The gross factor is wonderful!\n\nFreezing as a form of preservation can be both good & bad. Think of it as putting a steak in a freezer bag, putting it in the freezer, & leaving it for 20 years. It still may resemble the steak but won't taste all that good nor look that good. So it preserves pretty well as a whole but, like eggman said, not at the cellular level.\n\nFunny story about Wooly Mammoths being preserved though freezing...There is more than one version of the story but I like this one better it makes more sense...Also, this may just be one of those geologist myths...(as told by my prof & read in magazines)\n\nWhen the first mammoth was discovered, scientists had a ""cookout"" w/ the meat that was around 10,000 years old.\n\nOn a dare to each other they decided to cook & eat the meat. Problem is w/ 10,000 year old mammoth meat you don't know how many times the freezer ""went down"", if you know what I mean!\n\nWell supposedly the meat partially rotted either before it completely froze or sometime later during a thaw. It had started to decomp. It made them sick.\n\nMoral of the story...don't eat meat that is older than you or that you weren't old enough to remember seeing put into the freezer.\n\nI love to gross my students out w/ that story when I am passing my sample of mammoth hair around the room.\n\n:)"
"1","Would you listen to them?","I honestly can't believe the things I am hearing from Jehovah's Witnesses. I've been talking to them and find them humble and eager to teach. I was raised a Catholic, have studied many different religions, but none of them compare to Jehovah's Witnesses. I have always found all religions to be hypocritical in some way, but not with the JWs (and trust me, I've been trying to find something wrong w/ them). Every single one of their teachings they back up with the scriptures- it's even kinda annoying! lol. I don't know what made me open my door up to them that day, but I did. Anyways, my question is would u listen to them? Give them a chance? If not, why not?","These facts about Jehovah's Witnesses are perhaps relevant to this question. The more one compares this Christian religion with others, the more remarkable it is shown to be.\n\n1. Jehovah's Witnesses have no paid clergy. Yet they remain tightly organized with more than 6.5 million active Jehovah's Witness preachers (about 16 million associate themselves with the religion). Even fulltime preachers and workers at their branch offices are unpaid volunteers.\n\n2. There is no elite class among Jehovah's Witnesses. Even the few 'anointed' among them enjoy no special privileges in their congregations on earth. An anointed person (one of those relative few with a heavenly hope) is not elevated above his fellow congregants in any way, and he may not even qualify for appointment as a simple 'deacon' or elder. There are no titles; EVERYONE is addressed as 'brother' or 'sister'.\n\n3. No person benefits economically from the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Even the 8 to 20 men who serve on their Governing Body receive simply room, board, medical care, and reimbursement for certain personal expenses according to the exact same provision as every other branch volunteer.\n\n4. About a hundred men have served on Jehovah's Witnesses' Governing Body committee during the past 125 years or so. The vast majority of them have spent the vast majority of their adult lives volunteering for their organization's purposes, and the vast majority have died faithfully and near-pennilessly while still under their legal 'vow of poverty'.\n\n5. Amazingly, Jehovah's Witnesses did not splinter as a sect from some other religion. Instead, a truly tiny but sincere group of bible students studied only the Scriptures to determine the will of God. Thus their religion remains absolutely independent of and not carrying the sins of Christendom's history, yet carries the authority of Christ's teachings.\n\n6. Despite the distortions of anti-Witnesses, throughout their modern history Jehovah's Witnesses have refused to claim divine inspiration or infallibility for their teachings. They have pointed to the bible (and not any particular translation) as the only inspired infallible means of knowing God's thoughts. For over 125 years, their teachings have been presented as merely the results of sincere bible research by imperfect but godly humans.\n\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/jt/article_07.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20040601/article_02.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/people/who.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/people/statistics.htm"

"1","What's Behind 666?","","33 The wild beast has a name, and this name is a number: 666. Six, as a number, is associated with Jehovah’s enemies.  A Philistine man of the Rephaim was of “extraordinary size,” and his “fingers and toes were in sixes.” (1 Chronicles 20:6) King Nebuchadnezzar erected a golden image 6 cubits in breadth and 60 cubits high, to unify his political officials in one worship. When God’s servants refused to worship the image of gold, the king had them thrown into a fiery furnace. (Daniel 3:1-23) The number six falls short of seven, which stands for completeness from God’s standpoint. Therefore, a triple six represents gross imperfection.\n\n     34 A name identifies a person.  So how does this number identify the beast?  John says that it “is a man’s number,” not that of a spirit person, so the name helps to confirm that the wild beast is earthly, symbolizing human government. Just as six fails to measure up to seven, so 666—six to the third degree—is a fitting name for the world’s gigantic political system that fails so miserably to measure up to God’s standard of perfection. The world’s political wild beast rules supreme under the name-number 666, while big politics, big religion, and big business keep that wild beast functioning as an oppressor of mankind and a persecutor of God’s people.\n\n35 What does it mean to be marked on the forehead or in the right hand with the name of the wild beast? When Jehovah gave Israel the Law, he told them:  “You must apply these words of mine to your heart and your soul and bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they must serve as a frontlet band between your eyes.” (Deuteronomy 11:18)  This meant that the Israelites had to keep that Law constantly before them, so that it influenced all their actions and thoughts.  In imitation, Satan uses the demonic mark of the wild beast.   Anybody engaged in everyday activities such as buying and selling is pressured to do things the way the wild beast does, as, for example, in celebrating holidays.  They are expected to worship the wild beast, letting it rule their lives, so as to receive its mark.\n\n38 Yes, the world is a difficult place for those who do not have the mark of the wild beast.  It is an outstanding demonstration of Jehovah’s power and blessing that the remaining ones of the seed of the woman, as well as more than three million of the great crowd, are keeping integrity despite all the pressures to break God’s laws.  (Revelation 7:9)  Unitedly, throughout the earth, may all of us continue to magnify Jehovah and his righteous ways, as we refuse to receive the mark of the wild beast.—Psalm 34:1-3.\n\n    If you would like further information or a free home Bible study, please contact Jehovah's Witnesses at the local Kingdom Hall.

This is very accurately described in the Quran which was reveiled 1400 years back.\n\n""Do not the unbelievers see that the skies (space) and the earth (matter) were joined together (as one unit of creation) and we ripped them apart?"" The Quran, 21:30","old school, it`s one but it`s literature buddy!!!\n\nI`d like to add more\n\nScientists’ Comments on the Scientific Miracles in the Holy Quran: \nThe following are some comments of scientists1 on the scientific miracles in the Holy Quran.  All of these comments have been taken from the videotape entitled This is the Truth.  In this videotape, you can see and hear the scientists while they are giving the following comments.  (To view the RealPlayer video of a comment, click on the link at the end of that comment.  For a copy of this videotape, please visit this page.) \n \n\n1)  Dr. T. V. N. Persaud is Professor of Anatomy, Professor of Pediatrics and Child Health, and Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  There, he was the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy for 16 years.  He is well-known in his field.  He is the author or editor of 22 textbooks and has published over 181 scientific papers.  In 1991, he received the most distinguished award presented in the field of anatomy in Canada, the J.C.B. Grant Award from the Canadian Association of Anatomists.  When he was asked about the scientific miracles in the Quran which he has researched, he stated the following: \n\n“The way it was explained to me is that Muhammad was a very ordinary man.  He could not read, didn’t know [how] to write. In fact, he was an illiterate.  And we’re talking about twelve [actually about fourteen] hundred years ago.  You have someone illiterate making profound pronouncements and statements and that are amazingly accurate about scientific nature.  And I personally can’t see how this could be a mere chance.  There are too many accuracies and, like Dr. Moore, I have no difficulty in my mind that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led him to these statements.”  (View the RealPlayer video of this comment ) \n\nProfessor Persaud has included some Quranic verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  in some of his books.  He has also presented these verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  at several conferences. \n\n2)  Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson is the Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.  Formerly, he was Professor of Ob-Gyn and the Chairman of the Department of Ob-Gyn at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  He was also the President of the American Fertility Society.  He has received many awards, including the Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology Public Recognition Award in 1992.  Professor Simpson studied the following two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad : \n\n{In every one of you, all components of your creation are collected together in your mother’s womb by forty days...}2 \n\n{If forty-two nights have passed over the embryo, God sends an angel to it, who shapes it and creates its hearing, vision, skin, flesh, and bones....}3 \n\nHe studied these two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  extensively, noting that the first forty days constitute a clearly distinguishable stage of embryo-genesis.  He was particularly impressed by the absolute precision and accuracy of those sayings of the Prophet Muhammad .  Then, during one conference, he gave the following opinion: \n\n“So that the two hadeeths (the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad ) that have been noted provide us with a specific time table for the main embryological development before forty days.  Again, the point has been made, I think, repeatedly by other speakers this morning: these hadeeths could not have been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge that was available [at] the time of their writing . . . . It follows, I think, that not only there is no conflict between genetics and religion but, in fact, religion can guide science by adding revelation to some of the traditional scienti"

"2","Why when a helicopter hovers the Earth doesnt move out from under it as the planet rotates?","","The helicopter is moving with the Earth (and air, ...) as the Earth rotates on its axis.  Just because the helicopter is no longer physically connected with the Earth does not mean that it longer moves with the Earth since its momentum is conserved.\nIts momentum while still located on the surface of the spinning Earth was some initial value.  When the Helicopter lifts up off the ground, by the law of conservation of momentum, it still has that same value.  However, if you want to be very technical, now that it is at a farther distance away from the center of the Earth, it is traveling just a wee bit slower than it should be in order to stay perfectly above its original position on the ground.  However, this difference in its speed of so small, it is easily negligible and is soon overcome by frictional forces."

"2","Do you believe in science??? If yes, to what extent? and why??If not why???","And another qustion which goes like this:\nThe sun is burning since billions of yrs. It has released tremendous amount of energy since then.According to Einstein,energy release is the result of mass lost. That means sun is continuously losing its mass since billions of yrs. According to Newton F= m1.m2/ d.d\n  Here the mass of the sun i.e. m2 is decreasing.And ultimately the value of F will be decreased. But still the sun is attracting the heavenly bodies with the same force..The earth and other planets have not yet left their orbits. How is this possible????How is it still balanced?????","That's not a valid question. Belief in Science is not required, because Science has and requires evidence to back up all it's claims. It's like opening a book on the plays of Shakespeare and saying you believe that the little symbols you see in the book form words. If the book could feel emotions it would not care whethor you believed there were words inside it or not, because your belief or your disbelief has no effect either way.\n\nThe closest you can say is whethor or not you agree with the conclusions the scientific community has derived from the evidence.\n\nAs for why we're still attracted to the sun, yes you are correct in that there is mass lost with the hydrogen nuclear reactions taking place, but the mass the sun loses is very small in comparison to the mass of the sun."

"1","why is it bad for to people of the same gender to get married even if they love each other ?","","It is not really a human question.  By whose standards are you living?  People will condemn you for everthing you do that is not the same as them.  If you are poor, fat, gay, stay at home mom, working mom, in private school, in public school...etc.  People are not what 'should' matter.  It is between you, and the person you get involved with.\n\nIf you beleive in God, then that is another matter and it is also completely your own business.  If you DO believe in God though....you'll have to be honest with yourself and take the matter to HIM alone in prayer.\n\nPeople need to mind their business about someone's private life - and if they are 'Chrisitians"" they cannot judge you -they can only look at themselves - and improve or make their own changes within.  \n\nLegalization would really depend on the religious influence of the country.  You cannot expect basic bible principles to change for your convenience. No need to be bitter - religion is not necessarily a bad thing, it is just not that convenient - for anybody who devoutly tries to follow it.  \n\nNot just gays. Nobody wants to feel discriminated against. It is not a good thing to have to live with. However gays have gained a lot - perhaps some feel that it has been at 'their' expense.

"2","genotypic and phenotypic ratios?","what is it","A genotype is the actual genetic code of an organism, the sequence of the base pairs on the DNA. The phenotype is what those genes actually express, what you would see if you looked at the organism.\n\nSay there's a gene that controls the color of a mouse's fur. We'll call the dominant form of the gene which gives brown fur, B. The recessive form, for white fur, will be b.\n\nA mouse gets one copy of the gene (called an allele) from each parent, for a total of two. That means there are three combinations of alleles: BB, bb, and Bb. A mouse with two recessive alleles will be white, and a mouse with two dominant alleles will be brown. A heterozygous mouse (with one dominant and one recessive copy) will also be brown.\n\nGenotype          Phenotype\nbb                White\nBB                Brown\nBb                Brown\n\nSo even though the BB and Bb mice have different genotypes, they have the same phenotype.\n\nIn the example above, the phenotypic ratio would reflect the amount of mice of a different color in a population. For example, if you crossed two heterozygous mice, the brown to white ratio of the offspring would be 3:1. The genotypic ratio, reflecting the genetic code of the offspring (BB to Bb to bb), would be 1:2:1."

"2","What is a protozoan?","","Protozoans are the unicellular heterotrophs of the kingdom Protista . Protozoans comprise a large, diverse assortment of microscopic or near-microscopic organisms that live as single cells or in simple colonies and that show no differentiation into tissues. Formerly classified in the animal kingdom, they are now generally divided into five protist phyla: Mastigophora (the flagellates), Sarcodina (the amebas), Ciliophora (the ciliates), Opalinida , and Sporozoa . Most are mobile, and most ingest food, as do animals, rather than produce it themselves, as do plants. The 26,000 living species are cosmopolitan in distribution; they are found in freshwater and at all depths in the ocean; some live in soil. Some are parasites in the bodies of humans or other animals, sometimes causing diseases. \n\nHOW THEY EAT\nSome protozoans have complex digestive systems and feed on large food particles, such as other microorganisms. The food is digested by means of enzymes and the wastes transported to the cell surface or stored in vacuoles (bubble like spaces in the cytoplasm). Others have no digestive system and absorb dissolved organic matter through the cell membrane. \n\nBREATHING\nRespiration is accomplished by the diffusion of dissolved gases through the cell membrane. Oxygen diffuses into the cell, where it oxidizes food molecules, producing energy and the organic molecules used for the building and maintenance of the cell. Carbon dioxide and water, the waste products of this oxidation, diffuse out of the cell."

For example, 214.4 eV will remove all three electrons from the lithium atom.\n\nI have seen atomic ion to refer to a nucleus without electrons.\n\nThe ionization energy to take all the electrons is either n(th) ionization energy (where n=atomic number) or ultimate ionization energy."

I remember seeing two girls one day both with full arm tattoos. The first girl I saw in the morning had a full sleeve and swallows on each shoulder (tank top shirt). The way she carried herself and the beautiful coloring of all her tattoos made it look AMAZING!! Meanwhile the girl I saw in the afternoon also had a full sleeve, but her tattoo was a weird naked woman with poems written out on her arm, she noticed I kept staring at her arm and told me not to read her arms (my expression was ??). So to recap my little tale, get as MANY and as COLORFUL as long as you are confident and proud of them all."

The dimers can also be detected in the vapour at 120 °C. They probably also occur in the liquid phase of pure acetic acid, but are rapidly disrupted if any water is present. This dimerisation behaviour is shared by other lower carboxylic acids.\n\nThis is seen because probable the strong hydrogen bonding in Acetic acid."

Other than slowly acquiring some negative traits, not much will happen in terms of physical evolution in the mean time.\n\nAfter this die-off, we will find ourselves in a world without the megafauna alongside of which we initially evolved.  These animals have since gone extinct.  Our food will have to be smaller and more frequent instead of big and less frequent.  As a result, I would predict a reduction in body size to more efficiently utilize resources from small to medium sized prey."

What relation would this have to the focal length because reducing the size would reduce the focal length. Would s and s' change with proportional to produce no change in magnification.","for the size of the lens i would go back to the lens maker formula it is:\npower of lens = (n(lens) - n(0)) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\nwhere n(lens) is refractive index of lens material\nn(0) is refractive index of the medium in which lens is kept\nR1 and R2 are surface radius of the two sides of the lens.\nso you can see from the equation to increase power of the lens we can either increase refractive index of the lens (assuming we are seeing it in air) or reduce the radius of curvature of the lens sides. so ideally as power increses the radius of the lens decreases and so the size of the lens also reduces. you can also check out gullstrands equation for further reference of thicker lenses. hope this helps"
"1","What do you think of homeless people?","I was at the bookstore today and there was a man there that I would assume was homeless by his appearance and extreme body odor.

Do you complain when the homeless occupy the same stores you do and think they should not be let to do so? Or do you feel compassion and just ignore them.","I try to get beyond my initial reactions of fear or disgust. I remind myself that these people need compassion and understanding. I realize that I can't know all there is to know about them in one encounter and that the homeless are not one homogenous group. There are a variety of reasons for their status. \n\nI would not complain that they should leave a store, library, train or whatever. I hope I challenge myself to question my assumptions and become more giving to them. Sometimes I do give them money or a transit card or something to eat. (Once I offered a doggie bag with pizza in it to a homeless woman and was puzzled that she rejected it because she didn't like the flavor. It's hard not to judge, but by forcing myself to see that she needs dignity and can decide if she can decline an offer of food so be it.)\n\nLet these encounters help you become a better person."
"2","how do people determin where a galaxy ends?","are they like states, something u can't actually see or is there something distinctive that shows where they end?","This is actually not as easy as it looks. If you look at a picture of a galaxy, it is usually pretty clear where the stars stop and that is usually regarded as the edge of the galaxy. The problem is that all galaxies have a 'halo' of gas with a few stars and this halo can extend quite a bit further out than the stars themselves do. Sometimes this gas is very hot and emits X-rays or gamma rays, which is one way we detect it. Even worse is the fact that most galaxies are in clusters where the halos actually merge to a great extent. Finally, there is also a 'dark matter' halo around all galaxies that has its own distribution that may be different than that of the gas halo.\n\nIn practice, the edge is usually defined by where the visible stars stop, but an awareness has to be kept of these other issues and heir effects on the motions of the stars themselves."

I find that hard to believe, because one the middle east doesn't have that kind of technology, or at least I don't thik so. SO all I want too know is do humans really have that kind of technology?","No, I don't think so, but that doesn't mean that someone isn't trying. That guy in Idaho is pretty wacko, but I have heard of a few things that OUR government/military have been doing in Alaska.  I've read and heard a few things about using microwave beams of natural radiation (basically microwaves directed at cloud formations and the Ionisphere) that change the winds in the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere, change some cloud formations, I believe by disapation, with the high concentration of the microwave energy (and it requires a huge amount of energy to power this beam, and also I don't know what the power source would be, but still it would require a ton of energy, to run this device, like having it's own power plant type of #'s), and the one other point is that the area that is effected by this microwave beam is very small and regionalized, probably just a few 10's of feet.  I've read a few things on the net, and of course there are conspiracy theories and all, but the US Govt have been interested in weather modification for a long time to use as a weapon of war, to help weaken the enemy, so it wouldn't surprise me to think that some form of this has got to be true. The person who controls the weather, will eventually rule the world, pretty heavy stuff, I know. So we may have some of the technology to do this, but it's on a very small scale. The guy from Idaho is crazy, but at the same time he is making alot of money off of this crap, with his internet sites and radio appearances. This guy used to be a tv weatherman, but then saw the dollar signs to do this, instead. Hmmm..., maybe I should do this?"

"2","Can a man be considered to be heterozygous, if so please give an example!?","","When Mendel began to scientifically analyze ""heredity"", he concluded that each parent (mother + father) donates an ""allele"" for a characteristic (trait) in question.\n\nA lettering system was used: Capital letters indicated that the allele is DOMINANT; lower-case letters indicate that the allele is RECESSIVE.  This is the case for 22 of the 23 chromosome pairs in humans.  The 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes.  Females (mother) always donate an ""X"" allele; fathers can donate either an ""X"" or a ""Y"" allele.\n\nIf a person's genotype for their sex is ""XX"", this means two things.  1: Both X's are the same (in other words, X and X are identical).  Identical alleles are called HOMOZYGOUS.  2: A human who is ""XX"" is female.\n\nA human who is ""XY"" is male.  ""X"" allele and ""Y"" allele are DIFFERENT.  Thus, they called HETEROZYGOUS.  We refer to men as being ""heterozygous"" in that a male's SEX alleles, 'X' and 'Y' are different.\n\nLet us say ""B"" is the dominant allele for brown eyes, and ""b"" is the recessive allele that can result in blue eyes.  A person who is ""Bb"" is heterozygous (B is a different allele than b).  A person's who genotype is Bb is likely to have brown eyes.  A person who is ""BB"" is HOMOZYGOUS (1st B is identical to the 2nd B) and will definitely have brown eyes.  A person who is ""bb"" is HOMOZYGOUS (1st allele 'b' is identical to the 2nd allele, 'b') for the recessive allele; this person will have blue eyes."

The point is to say the first thing in your mind.

So we are faking ourselves to even us.\n\nWhat is true chemistry between people? When they are both themselves and extremely comfortable.\n\nBut changing how you act in front of different people is not a bad thing - everyone does it to different degrees. The problem is when it bothers YOU that you can't ""open up."" If that's the case, then it's better to just be yourself and not worry about what others think...obviously don't say things to offend people or be rude. But beyond that, anything goes. I am me, and the world's gonna know who I am.\n\n\nWhen you open yourself up, you'll get some people who like you, and some people that don't. But this depends less on what you actually say and do. It depends more on how you actually feel about yourself. The best bet is to be yourself AND like yourself!"

The quantity of heat in 0 degrees C is 273 degrees K, so technically you could say tomorrow will be 136.5 degrees K tomorrow (I sure hope not since that is -136.5 degrees C or -213.7 degrees F).\n\nThe issue is the scale.  Think about the case of 0 degrees C which equals 32 degrees F.  In Farenheit, you'd say the answer is 16 degrees, but in Celsius you'd say 0.  But that's two different answers depending on the scale.  If I were to create my own scale, you could make the answer anything.\n\nSo the real answer is you can't answer this question."

"1","Do you think the desire to have children is mainly altruistic or mainly selfish?","Or is it a physical urge that goes deeper than either one of these?","Thats a good question, but maybe too philosophical. It´s really just an urge. Perhaps, the question is: can an urge not be selfish? When you have an altruistic impulse, you´re really simply trying to satisfy yout own urge. Let me explain better: let´s say you donate money. Even if you do it privately, aren´t you really satisfying a need to feel good about yourself, or maybe, to ease a guilty conscience.\nTaking it a step further, a social biologist, would argue that, even very altruistic deeds, e.g. if you risk/ lose your life to save others (specially kids or women), it still is a very selfish act. The idea is that, since we share so many genes, there might acctually be a better chance of perpetuating your own genes (not the physical dna but the information) by sacrificing yourself and saving a child or a child factory (aka womb).\nThis also idea explains and justifies the urge to save wild animals like lions or apes (but not geckos), their genes are, in large, the same as ours own. Which come down to saying that even tree huggers are kind of selfish. \nSo chillout."

"1","ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT POSEIDOn???","What did he do? Anything special about him except for the fact that he's the sea god and horse and trident? Any myths... Also, what do you think he wore or looked like...","Poseidon\n\nPoseidon is a god of many names. He is most famous as the god of the sea. The son of Cronus and Rhea, Poseidon is one of six siblings who eventually ""divided the power of the world."" His brothers and sisters include: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Zeus. The division of the universe involved him and his brothers, Zeus and Hades. Poseidon became ruler of the sea, Zeus ruled the sky, and Hades got the underworld. The other divinities attributed to Poseidon involve the god of earthquakes and the god of horses. The symbols associated with Poseidon include: dolphins, tridents, and three-pronged fish spears. \n Poseidon was relied upon by sailors for a safe voyage on the sea. Many men drowned horses in sacrifice of his honor. He lived on the ocean floor in a palace made of coral and gems, and drove a chariot pulled by horses. However, Poseidon was a very moody divinity, and his temperament could sometimes result in violence. When he was in a good mood, Poseidon created new lands in the water and a calm sea. In contrast, when he was in a bad mood, Poseidon would strike the ground with a trident and cause unruly springs and earthquakes, ship wrecks, and drownings. \n\nPoseidon was similar to his brother Zeus in exerting his power on women and in objectifying masculinity. He had many love affairs and fathered numerous children. Poseidon once married a Nereid, Amphitrite, and produced Triton who was half-human and half-fish. He also impregnated the Gorgon Medusa to conceive Chrysaor and Pegasus, the flying horse. The rape of Aethra by Poseidon resulted in the birth of Theseus; and he turned Caeneus into a man, at her request, after raping her. Another rape involved Amymone when she tried to escape from a satyr and Poseidon saved her. Other offspring of Poseidon include: Eumolpus, the Giant Sinis, Polyphemus, Orion, King Amycus, Proteus, Agenor and Belus from Europa, Pelias, and the King of Egypt, Busiris. \n\nOne of the most notorious love affairs of Poseidon involves his sister, Demeter. Poseidon pursued Demeter and to avoid him she turned herself into a mare. In his lust for her, Poseidon transformed himself into a stallion and captured her. Their procreation resulted in a horse, Arion. Poseidon is Greek for ""Husband"" (possibly of wheat), and therefore it is thought that he and Demeter (goddess of wheat) are a good match because they reign as the god and goddess of fertility. \n\n Another infamous story of Poseidon involves the competition between him and the goddess of war, Athena, for the city of Athens. To win the people of the city over, Poseidon threw a spear at the ground and produced the Spring at the Acropolis. However, Athena won as the result of giving the people of Athens the olive tree. In his anger over the decision, Poseidon flooded the Attic Plain. Eventually, Athena and Poseidon worked together by combining their powers. Even though Poseidon was the god of horses, Athena built the first chariot. Athena also built the first ship to sail on the sea over which Poseidon ruled. \n\nPoseidon often used his powers of earthquakes, water, and horses to inflict fear and punishment on people as revenge. Though he could be difficult and assert his powers over the gods and mortals, Poseidon could be cooperative and it was he who helped the Greeks during the Trojan War. Poseidon is an essential character in the study of Greek mythology. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

"2","which part of the UK can i witness the aurora borealis? and when?","if not the uk, then please suggest to me which is the nearest area from the UK to see the northern light? and when is the best time?","The aurora borealis most often occurs from September to October and from March to April. They may be seen from anywhere in Northern Scotland. The 2nd link provided will provide you with up to date forecasts of Aurora activity and the 3rd an e-mail messenger service for imminent Aurora activity and from where it may be seen in the UK. Hope this all helps.\n\nThe aurora is a common occurrence in the ring-shaped zone. It is occasionally seen in temperate latitudes, when a strong magnetic storm temporarily expands the auroral oval. Large magnetic storms are most common during the peak of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after that peak. However, within the auroral zone the likelihood of an aurora occurring depends mostly on the slant of IMF lines (known as Bz, pronounced ""bee-sub-zed"" or ""bee-sub-zee""), being greater with southward slants.\n\nGeomagnetic storms that ignite auroras actually happen more often during the months around the equinoxes. It is not well understood why geomagnetic storms are tied to the earth's seasons when polar activity is not. It is known, however, that during spring and autumn, the earth's and the interplanetary magnetic field link up. At the magnetopause, Earth's magnetic field points north. When Bz becomes large and negative (i.e., the IMF tilts south), it can partially cancel Earth's magnetic field at the point of contact. South-pointing Bz's open a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach Earth's inner magnetosphere.\n\nThe peaking of Bz during this time is a result of geometry. The interplanetary magnetic field comes from the sun and is carried outward the solar wind. Because the sun rotates the IMF has a spiral shape. Earth's magnetic dipole axis is most closely aligned with the Parker spiral in April and October. As a result, southward (and northward) excursions of Bz are greatest then.\n\nHowever, Bz is not the only influence on geomagnetic activity. The Sun's rotation axis is tilted 7 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit. Because the solar wind blows more rapidly from the sun's poles than from its equator, the average speed of particles buffeting Earth's magnetosphere waxes and wanes every six months. The solar wind speed is greatest -- by about 50 km/s, on average -- around September 5 and March 5 when Earth lies at its highest heliographic latitude.\n\nStill, neither Bz nor the solar wind can fully explain the seasonal behavior of geomagnetic storms. Those factors together contribute only about one-third of the observed semiannual variation.\n\nThe sun gives off high-energy charged particles (also called ions) that travel out into space at speeds of 300 to 1200 kilometres per second. A cloud of such particles is called a plasma. The stream of plasma coming from the sun is known as the solar wind. As the solar wind interacts with the edge of the earth's magnetic field, some of the particles are trapped by it, and they follow the lines of magnetic force down into the ionosphere, the section of the earth's atmosphere that extends from about 60 to 600 kilometres above the earth's surface. When the particles collide with the gasses in the ionosphere they start to glow, producing the spectacle that we know as the auroras, northern and southern. The array of colours consists of red, green, blue and violet."

Of that amount, about 60 percent is used for crops, the remainder for pasture and meadow (see table 15, Appendix). \n\nIn the European part of Russia, the most productive land is in the Central Chernozem Economic Region and the Volga Economic Region, which occupy the grasslands between Ukraine and Kazakstan. More than 65 percent of the land in those regions is devoted to agriculture. \n\nIn Siberia and the Far East, the most productive areas are the southernmost regions. Fodder crops dominate in the colder regions, and intensity of cultivation generally is higher in European Russia. The last expansion of cultivated land occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Virgin Lands program of Nikita Khrushchev opened land in southwestern Siberia (and neighboring Kazakstan) for cultivation. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, about 15 percent of the working population was occupied in agriculture, with the proportion dropping slowly as the younger population left rural areas to seek economic opportunities elsewhere (see Rural Life, ch. 5)."

"1","How do you feel about the behavior of New Orlenians during the Katrina crisis? Want to go to New Orleans?","","They were WARNED that they MUST evacuate.  Busses were running full time to get people out, yet so many refused to leave.  Some were on the news dancing in the streets of the French Quarter as the storm approached.  After the storm, they all ran for the Superdome, and there were not enough supplies for the additional people, so that screwed the people who originally went to be sheltered there.  Something else angers me: The National Guard gets blamed for not responding, but the storm was over Tuesday, and TV cameras broadcast National Guard at the airport on Thursday.  This pretty enlisted female told the reporter that they arrived Wednesday, and were setting up relief.\n\nThen cops are out there looting Wal Mart (caught on video).  It would have been one thing if they were getting food, but, well you know the rest of the story.  \n\nPeople cry for the idiots in New Orleans (no, the ones who evacuated are NOT idiots), while Rita pretty much levelled some towns in Southwest Louisiana.

Nothing is found in a vacuum. Regarding that specific passage, they are the words of the Assyrian embassy to Jerusalem who came to threaten King Hezekiah. The officials of Jerusalem asked Rabshakeh not to speak in a language comprehensible to the soldiers (the men which sit on the wall), lest they become disheartened. The Rabshekah responds as you cite, essentially saying ""I have not come only to threaten you, but to humiliate you and all your people even to the point of being forced to consume their own waste.""\n\nAnd if we keep going, (NRSV translation):\n18:28-32  ""Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah, ""Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah make you rely on the Lord by saying, the Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me; then every one of you will eat from your own vine and your own tree, and drink water from your own cistern, until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey, that you may live and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying, The Lord will deliver us.""\n\nAnd so on, and so on.\n\nIf you're going to argue from the Bible, at least know a little about it.

"2","What is the single most important technological advancement of the 20th century?  space shuttle dont count!?","","Discovery of the DNA structure.\n\nThe discovery of the DNA structure was the start of a new era in biology, leading, over the next two decades, to the cracking of the genetic code and the realization that DNA directs the synthesis of proteins. There were technical advances too, such as DNA sequencing, genetic engineering, and gene cloning. More recently, the complete sequences of many organisms have been solved - including the human genome in June 2000. The next 50 years of the DNA story will be all about realizing the practical benefits of Crick and Watson's discovery for humanity - in industry, medicine, food and agriculture."

"2","Is there a similarity between internal structure of an atom and solar system?","","Not really.  There is a mass at the center, and smaller things 'orbiting', but the similarities are beaten out by the differences.  Unlike planets, the electrons are all the same mass, and much larger compared to the central mass than planets are to the sun.  Also they do not really orbit all in the same plane in the same way that planets do, some of the orbits are ring- shaped, some are like figure 8's and others are sort a 4-lobed pyramid deal.  Plus they are not really solid objects like planets.  The present thinking, for the past 100 years or so, has the electron's orbit as more like a sort of charged cloud with the actual 'presence' of the electron itself at any one place described by a probability rather than being able to say it has a definite location.\n\nAlso, the forces in play are quite different.  The planets whirl around in the grip of gravity, and it is pretty strong but it is still by far the weakest of the forces that can interact with matter.  The forces that act only upon subatomic particles are very different in nature and far more powerful than gravity.\n\nI'd say the similarities are there, like the similarity between certain small dogs and a cat.  But the differences are fundamental."

"2","How does glycoprotein get synthesized that is destined for the plasma membrane?","","DNA goes to mRNA\n\nthe mRNA has a signal sequence on the 5' end which directs it to the Ribosome and indicates whether it will be inserted into the Endoplasmic Reticulum(ER) while it is being translated.  In this case it is inserted into the ER.  As it is inserted it is folded into it's 3-D conformation.  Pending on whether parts are inserted into the membrane of the ER or not it will be determined if this Plasma Membrane(PM) protein is secreted or is stuck to the membrane.  After this you get the addition of the ""glyco"" part of the protein through numerous transferases and other molecules inside the ER.  This only happens inside the ER, as to why the former steps were necessary.  Then the protein is transfered via a vesicle to the Golgi Apparatus where further post-translational modifications take place.  At this point the protein is ready to go to the plasma membrane as a glycoprotein.  The protein needs no signal to get there however as the pathway from the Golgi to the PM is the ""default"" pathway and any unmarked(so to say) vesicle will find it's way to the Plasma Membrane.  And that's that."
"2","list the various types of torque wrenches used?","and the formulas of torque wrench calculation.","Torque wrench\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nA torque wrench is a wrench used to precisely set the torque of a fastening such as a nut or bolt. It is usually in the form of a socket wrench with special internal mechanisms. A torque wrench is used where the tightness of screws and bolts is crucial. It allows the operator to measure the torque applied to the bolt so it can be matched to the specifications. This permits proper tension and loading of all parts. A torque wrench indirectly measures bolt tension. The technique suffers from inaccuracy due to inconsistent friction between the fastener and its mating hole. Measuring bolt tension (bolt stretch) is more accurate but most often torque is the only means of measurement possible.\n\nBeam type\n \nBeam type torque wrench. The indicator bar remains straight while the main shaft bends proportionally to the pressure applied at the handle.The simplest form of torque wrench consists of a long lever arm between the handle and the wrench head, made of a material which will bend elastically a little under the applied torque. A second smaller bar carrying an indicator is connected back from the head in parallel to the lever arm. This second arm is under no strain at all, and remains straight. A calibrated scale is fitted to the handle, and the bending of the main lever causes the scale to move under the indicator. When the desired indicated torque is reached, the operator stops applying force. This type of wrench is simple but not very precise.\n\n \nClose up of beam type torque wrench showing detail of the torque display scale. This shows a torque of about 160 inch pounds or 17 newton meters.\n\n\nClick type\n \nClick-type torque wrench, adjusted by turning the knurled handleA more sophisticated method of presetting torque is using a calibrated clutch mechanism. At the point where the desired torque is reached, the clutch slips, preventing overtightening. The most common form uses a ball detent and spring, with the spring preloaded by an adjustable screw thread, calibrated in torque units. The ball detent transmits force until the preset torque is reached, at which point the force exerted by the spring is overcome and the ball ""clicks"" out of its socket. The advantage of this design is greater precision and a positive action at the set point. A number of variations of this design exist for different applications and different torque ranges.\n\nCalculation for torque wrench spanners and adapters with a dial wrench\n\nWhen using extension adapters and spanners, the torque applied to the nut is greater than that shown on the torque wrench dial. To calculate the increase, use the following formula:\n \nTT = DR (L+E)\n     -------\n        L   \n\nTT = True Torque\nDR = Dial Reading\nE = Extension Length\nL = Effective Wrench Length"

Now my question is that the point (given) is inside or outside the region that is surrounded by the common tangents and the circles?","I think I get it.  You're given the two circles (which I assume do not intersect and one is not inside the other) and then you have to come up with the equations for two tangential lines to both of these circles.  \n\nOnce you have the two lines this becomes a linear inequality system.  What you're asking is if the point is in the area bounded by one line on top and the other line on the bottom, so write these two lines as two inequalities.   Example: \n\ny1 < mx1 + b\n\ny2 > mx2 + b\n\nI think this is the format, it's been a while since I did stuff like this.  You can graph it by shading the area between the lines.\n\nAnyway, once you have this it's pretty easy: if a point satisfies both inequalities then it's inside the area.  If not, then it's outside.\n\nOkay, how to draw the tangent lines?  Well, this is a little trick to explain, it would be easier if I could graph it.  But the thing to remember is that by definition a tangent line is perpendicular to the circle at that point.  Thus if you draw a line connecting the centers of the two circles, and then draw one tangent line to the circles, then draw a line connecting the center of each circle to the tangent point on each circle, you will see that you have two similar right triangles that share the same angle.\n\nAt this point I don't think you need to use trignometry to find the equations of the tangent line ... but my mind is slipping a bit at this point and I need a moment to think it out.\n\nupdate:  I found the solution to finding the tangent to 2 circles knowing only the center points and the radii, but I'd have to draw you a picture to show you how.  It's complicated, as it involves a bunch of similar right triangles."

I'm betting on protein deficiency in an adult or late teen.\n\nNot only are bananas horrendously lacking in protein, they are also an incomplete source of protein. What that means is that they lack several essential amino acids that the body needs to make the protein it requires. The practical upshot is that no matter how much you ate your body would be totally incapable of manufacturing digestive or other enzymes or repairing damage. First you would experience constant lethargy. Then your stomach and ankles would bloat tremendously like the typical famine child. Then you would start suffering nausea and diarrhea. Then you would notice that your wounds wouldn't heal for months. Then you'd notice your hair starting to thin. Then the lethargy would increase and you'd spend more and more time asleep. One day you wouldn't wake up.\n\nI'd give you a year to live, 18 months at most."

"2","What is the difference between hydrogen and helium?","","Standard hydrogen has one proton and one electron. Standard helium has two protons, two electrons and two neutrons (so it's about four times as massive as hydrogen). Also, hydrogen has one positive chemical link, while helium has no chemical links (it's a noble gas, and therefore very inert)."
"1","How can some chirstians tell Homo/lesbians that they are going to hell but if you murder someone you wont?","i just dont get it. it boggles the mind so someone can be  a mass murder and still go to heaven ?","Just make sure you understand that God loves the individual, however, their behavior and life choice will lead them into bondage that will harden their hearts to God's eternal salvation. Because Homosexuality involves so much emotional investment, it is almost impossible to tell the them the truth without being labeled with very harsh epithets. \n\nThe homosexual has just as much access to salvation and forgiveness that the murder or even average person. The only difference is that most murderers know that they have done something wrong, and most homosexuals see their behavior as acceptible. So who is going to gain forgiveness? One who knows they are a sinner and pleads for mercy, or one who argues with God for acceptance?"

As long as it is on either of the circles, it will be paused.  To go between the two points, make a path going from the outside of the larger circle to the inner circle, and vice versa to come back out.

"2","Have you ever had an experiment of seeing something or being in a place, which, you had seen it in a dream?","And if you had,what do you think about it's reason?","When I was about 12, I dreamed one night that my father came in early from work and told my mom to pack up a lunch, he was taking the rest of the day off, and we were going fishing! We all piled into our truck and headed out. On the way, my dad stopped to pick up a friend who was walking along the road with a fishing pole over his shoulder. He jumped into the back of the truck and when we approached the turn off to a windy little road, he knocked on the back window and told my dad there was a real good fishing hole about 2 miles in but we'd have to walk a little ways to get there. Dad decided to try it. When we got to the end of the track there was a little log cabin, kind of falling down a bit. Behind the cabin was a storage shed and a tree with an old tire tied to it that we kids all took turns swinging on. Mom woke me up for school before the dream was over and I thought no more about it until the following saturday, when my dad came in early from work and announced that he was taking us all fishing! This was a rare event for us and I immediately remembered my dream. Everything happened as I have just described it. After we had picked up his friend, I told my dad about the dream because I was feeling a little creepy about it by then. He laughed at first but after I described the road and his friend knocked on the window when we got there, he wasn't laughing anymore. As we went along, everything was right where I said it would be and nobody could explain to me how I came to know these things. I had never been there before. We all had a good time and nothing happened to any of us but it was such a welcoming little place that when I thought about it in later years, I had the feeling that someone or something had just wanted a bit of company and so sent me a dream. We returned to the spot many times over the years and always caught our limit there."

"2","Newton's second law: lab?","he slope of the linearized acceleration vs. mass graph should be equivalent to the net force, and the slope of the acceleration vs. net force graph should be equivalent to one over mass. Explain why. Calculate the %error for each slope\nhow do i do this?\nand for the % error i keep on getting 91% no matter how i tried","In your lab you are dealing with the relationship of:\nf=m*a\nso a=f/m\n\nIf you plot the values of acceleration versus mass holding force constant, this is a non-linear graph, so it will depend on the range of your data.  As m gets large, the slope will approach zero.  As m gets small the slope will approach infinity, which makes sense.  The instantaneous slope of this line is -f/m^2.  So your error will depend on the relative magnitude of the mass with respect to the net force.\nIf you plot the values of acceleration versus net force while holding the mass constant, the slope of this line is 1/m.  Your error will depend on the accuracy of the system.  If the coefficient of kinetic friction is not a constant, or the force applied is not a constant, then error will be introduced into the system.\n\nj"

"2","how do they make liquid oxygen?","how do they make liquid oxygen? and if u find a website or somthin plz give me the link.","Usually when we think of oxygen, we think of the air we breathe. The air around us contains oxygen gas, as well as many other gases. If the air is cooled enough, it will change from a gas into a liquid or a solid.\n\nAir is made mostly of oxygen and nitrogen. To get nitrogen gas changed to a liquid, it must be cooled to minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit, which is minus 196 degrees Celsius. Oxygen turns into a liquid at a slightly higher temperature, minus 183 degrees Celsius. To get these gases down to such low temperatures, the air is compressed and cooled. When it is allowed to expand again, the temperature drops even further. By repeating this process many times, the air is eventually cooled to minus 312 degrees Fahrenheit. The liquid formed is a combination of oxygen and nitrogen.\n\nTo separate the oxygen, the liquid is warmed just enough for the nitrogen to turn back into a gas - leaving only the liquid oxygen."

I would make an appointment with her regular doctor and talk this over with him and tell him that you want tests done to see what is wrong, and if they don't do it I would take her elsewhere!

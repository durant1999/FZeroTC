It is extremely frustrating when others don't understand the disease, or find it surprising how we can get so tired so often; how we can be in pain so often.  Sometimes I truly believe others think we are making it up. I am on a sick leave from work due to a string of flares that would just not go away. I get foggy spells sometimes, I am usually tired most of the time, and my joints get very achy and I can be bed-ridden for the entire day. Then some days are flare/pain free and you wouldn't even know I had the disease.\nOn a side note, I also have been taking Plaquenil for the past year and a half and have always been worried in the back of my mind that I would be within that small percentage who suffer eye damage from it. If you are on Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine is another name for it)--make sure you see your Optometriest twice a year, rather than once a year.  \nLastly, to all the people who replied to this question and are suffering from ANY auto-immune disease, I wish you all the best of luck and hope that someday they will find a cure for us all.

What is produced in a certain country is naturally also sold, but some of the goods produced in a given year may not be sold the same year, but in later years. Coherently, some of the goods sold in a given year might have been produced in an earlier year. The difference between goods produced (production) and goods sold (sales) in a given year is called inventory investment.\n\nIf firms produce more than they sell and inventories are accumulated, inventory investment is positive.\n\nIf firms sell more than they produce and inventories fall, inventory investment is negative.\n\n\nThree Important Relations\nThese three relations between production, sales and inventory investment can be helpful:\n\nInventory investment = production - sales\n\nProduction = sales + inventory investment\n\nSales = production - inventory investment"

When the chain or ring carries the full complement of hydrogen atoms, the hydrocarbon is said to be ""saturated"".  Such hydrocarbons are known as paraffins, paraffinic hydrocarbons, or alkanes/cycloalkanes.

It relies on a film of oil to support the shaft and permit shaft to rotate within the sleeve. \n\nUnlike an antifriction bearing (ball or roller type) A journal bearing tends to generate a good bit of heat and needs a method to keep cool either by radiation or a circulating system using a coolant. The oil film also needs a method to maintain sufficient oil to keep the oil film from breaking down."

"2","Why you cannot give atropine to glaucoma patients ?","","Atropine effect the muscles in the eye that are responsible for contarcting and dilating the iris. When atropine is administered these muscles are temporarily paralysed and dilate. This dilation causes the the flow of liquid (aqueous humor) to be restricted thus raising the pressure within the eyeball.\nOne of the main symptoms of Glaucoma (specifically acute angle closure glaucoma) is an increase in pressure with the eye ball that causes pain and damage to the optic nerve and requires emergency treatment. Therefore any drug that will cause an increase in the pressure within the eye ball will not be administered to patients with acute angle closure glaucoma."

"2","what    are     the    inputs for engine degreaser?","","http://shop.store.yahoo.com/autopia/inf-engine.html\n\nApplying Degreaser\nAfter warming the engine and protecting sensitive areas, you're ready to apply your engine degreaser.  Although they are quick and easy, I warn people against the use of harsh petroleum-based cleaners in the engine compartment.  They quickly cut through grease and grime, but they also deteriorate your rubber and vinyl components (not to mention what they do to our environment!).  As an alternative, use a citrus- or water-based cleaner.  My  favorites are 303 Aerospace Industrial Cleaner and Autoglym Engine & Machine Cleaner.\n\n\n \nHolly is using a degreaser on the top side of her engine.  Good degreasers are strong enough to cut through the heavy grease and dirt, but some scrubbing is necessary to remove the remaining dirt film.\n \n\nWhen applying your engine degreaser, it's best to start from the lower areas and work your way up.  This prevents the degreaser from dripping on you as you clean the underside areas.  One important thing to remember: the engine degreaser will remove the wax from the painted surfaces of your car.  If you get degreaser overspray on your fenders, plan on re-waxing these areas.\n\nWhen you have applied your engine degreaser, be sure to wash any excess cleaner from the exterior painted surfaces of the fenders, hood and grille.  I like to spray these areas with water first.\n\nDepending on the amount of accumulated grease, allow the degreaser to soak on the engine for 3 to 5 minutes.  Do not allow the degreaser to dry on your engine.  For light to mild levels of grease, you will not need to use a brush on the engine and other surfaces.  For heavy soil, you can use a long-handled brush (parts brush) and car wash solution to provide additional cleaning action prior to hosing off the degreaser.\n\n\n \nUse a soft parts cleaning brush get into cracks and around parts.  If your engine compartment has a heavy accumulation of dirt, you may need to spray with cleaner, brush, and rinse several times.\n \n\n \nAn old toothbrush works great in tight areas that other brushes can't reach. \n \n\nHosing Off\nWhen you are ready to remove the degreaser, hose down the entire engine compartment and surrounding surfaces with plenty of water.  If you're using a high-pressure nozzle, be careful that you don't get the nozzle too close to the covered electrical connectors.  Allow your engine to air dry for several minutes before using a towel to wipe down all accessible parts.  Remove the plastic bags.  The heat from the engine will assist in the drying process; however, do not allow the engine to air dry, as this will result in water spots.  When dry, start your engine and allow it to run for a few minutes.\n\n\n \nRinse with a stiff stream of water to remove as much of the grease and grime as possible.  Be sure to avoid electrical connections and other sensitive areas.  After rinsing, start the engine immediately.  Allow it to run for about 5 minutes to help dry things out.\n \n\n \nHere's a handy tip for you.  After your final rinse use your vacuum (if it can blow forced air) or an air compressor to blow water off the engine for a spot-free finish.  This Vac B' Blow vacuum makes quick work of the job."
"3","Do you know what I might have?  Curious...???","I've been experiencing the following symptoms for about 8+ months.  Has anyone else experienced the same, or know what could be wrong? \n\n-Headaches (usually left front and side of head).  The headaches at this point usually occur in the morning, at night, AND usually during or immediately after physical activity (exercise, walking up stairs, even after intercourse!)\n-tiredness\n-forgetfulness at work.  My colleagues have noticed that I have been making frequent errors, mixing up information, using the wrong words, or blanking out, etc. on a daily basis.\n-numbness in the hands and arms.  Sometimes only my pinky and ring finger are numb.\n-stiff neck, or spasms in my neck\nI have had blood tests, an xray of my neck, and a CT scan done but they were done a long time ago when the only symptom I had were the headaches.  I was seeing a Chiropractor for 3 months (who performed ART), but it didn't help.  I have an appointment with a Neurologist next month","I'm not a doctor and this is not a diagnosis nor should it be construed as medical device. /end disclaimer\n\nYour symptoms suggest to me three possibilities.\n\nOne is that you're naturally not sleeping well. This is incredibly common when there are a multitude of symptoms or general breakdown. Headaches, tiredness, an ability to concentrate and recall information can all be the result of exhaustion.\n\nSecond, and poor sleep increases the risk of this, is that you could have pre-diabetes. Don't freak out. I think it's BS that diabetes is ""incurable"". It's incurable by drugs is all that means to me! Again, headaches and forgetfulness are more common when diabetes is present. What really makes me think this may be the case though is the numbness. Diabetes leads to poor circulation which leads to numbness and ""tingling"". It can get really bad to the point where wounds don't heal, the tissue can't maintain itself and might even need to be amputated. Don't stress though since there's a lot you can do.\n\nThe third possibility is that you have compression or too much tension in your neck. That can lead to headaches and to problems in other areas that a compressed nerve leads to... which could manifest as numbness. I'm not opposed to chiropractic but I've never had great lasting results either. And I certainly don't put enough faith in it to risk a neck adjustment.\n\nSo what would I do?\n\n1. Lots of water to stay hydrated (for brain function) and keep my spinal discs hydrated.\n2. Eat a balanced diet including good fats such as from nuts, salmon, and seeds. Your brain is made up of nerves and nerves are largely fat. In fact, your brain is roughly 60% fat! Avoid sugar, white flour and excessive caffeine.\n3. Go to sleep before midnight (preferrably 10 or 11) and get 7-8 hours. Don't oversleep. Make sure you sleep in a quality sleep system (mattress, comfortor, and pillow are important). Don't use sedatives or alcohol to get to sleep.\n4. Stretch often throughout the day. Get up out of your chair regularly and go for a good walk at least once a day. Massage the muscles in your neck.\n5. Wear a magnetic necklace. It seem to help relieve some of the tension.\n6. Exercise daily. Some moderate weight-bearing exercise will help build your muscles and support your head, neck and shoulders.\n7. Sit with proper posture.\n\nKeep Well,\nRob"

Also 500 mg of vitamin C is not a lot. The ODI (Optimum Daily Intake) of Vitamin C is 1000-2000 mg a day. Plus when you say Vitamin C please remember that  there is 4 types of commercially available Vit.C. ASCORBIC ACID which is the most acidic and the most irritating  to the stomach and it isn't recommended that you do more than 1000 mg a day of ascorbic acid unless it's buffered.Which leads us to BUFFERED Vitamin C usually a generic unpatented form of Calcium Ascorbate(Calcium Carbonate+Ascorbic Acid)Incidentally Cal. Carbonate lowers acid Ph. A well known form of Buffered Vitamin C is ESTER-C which can remain in the body for 24 hours.The best form of Buffered Vit. C is MULTI-MINERAL ASCORBATE VIT.C(usually Zinc,Calcium,Magnesium,Manganese,Chromium,&Potassium Ascorbate)Also there is Ascorbyl Palmitate(Ascorbic Acid+Palmitic Acid) which is a fat soluable form of Vit. C which can stay in the body for a long time. Then there is FOOD STATE Vit. C which is Vitamin-C supplements made from fruits and other food sources and over all the best form of Vitamin -C. Ascorbic Acid by itself is usually SYNTHETICand is the poorest choice of Vitamin C. I hope this isn't too much info for you."
"3","What are pros and cons of Fish Oil pills?","","Fish Oil \n\n\nClaims, Benefits: Prevents heart disease, alleviates auto-immune disorders, plus many other claims. \n\nBottom Line: Fish oil contains heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Many studies find some beneficial effect, especially against heart attacks. But supplements can have adverse effects. We recommend fish, but not fish oil capsules, except for those with heart disease or auto-immune disorders. \n\nFull article, Wellness Letter, November 2003: \n\nShould You Take Fish Oil Pills? \n\nNearly every month there’s another study showing the health benefits of fish, and some of these studies have used fish-oil supplements. The Wellness Letter has never been big on these supplements. They contain the heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, but not the other good things in fish, and they are not without risk. Our opinion about these supplements has changed somewhat, however, because of ongoing research and new advice from the American Heart Association (AHA). \n\nHere’s who should consider taking fish-oil supplements: \n\nPeople who already have coronary artery disease, notably those who have had a heart attack. There is solid evidence that omega-3s can help protect them. Thus, last year the AHA started recommending 1 gram a day of omega-3s, preferably from fish, for these people, with their doctors’ approval. That’s the amount in a serving of fatty fish, such as 3 ounces of salmon. But most people don’t eat fish every day, and many choose less-fatty fish (it takes 12 ounces of canned tuna or 7 ounces of flounder to supply 1 gram of omega-3s). Moreover, since fish may contain mercury, we advise limiting fish intake to 12 ounces a week, on average. So to get enough omega-3s without going overboard on fish, people with heart disease should consider taking fish-oil supplements on days when they don’t eat fish. \n\nThose with high triglycerides. These fats in the blood increase the risk of heart disease. It’s well known that omega-3s help lower triglycerides. The AHA recommends 2 to 4 grams a day from supplements for people with high triglycerides, but only under the care of a physician. \n\nThose with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or other auto-immune disorders. Omega-3s may help relieve the inflammatory symptoms of such auto-immune diseases by suppressing the immune response. Thus, they can help reduce the joint pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis. The Arthritis Foundation says the supplements are worth trying. Clinical studies suggest about 3 grams of omega-3s a day. \n\nWhat about people with coronary risk factors, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, but no apparent heart disease? We suggest that they get their omega-3s from two or three weekly servings of fatty fish. There have been no clinical studies to see if fish-oil supplements will help them. \n\nNot for everyone \n\nIf fish oil is so great, why shouldn’t everyone take supplements? \n\n• The decreased ability of the blood to clot, which helps prevent heart attacks, has a negative side, notably an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. People with bleeding disorders, those taking anticoagulants, and those with uncontrolled hypertension should not take fish oil supplements.\n\n• Large doses of fish oil may suppress the immune system. Thus, supplements may be risky for those with weakened immune systems. What’s a ""large dose""? One definition is 3 grams or more a day, but no one really knows what the cutoff point is.\n\n• Large doses can increase glucose levels in people with diabetes.\n\n• Large doses can cause nausea, diarrhea, belching, and a bad taste in the mouth. \n\n• The supplements may contain contaminants and may not contain the labeled dose. A recent test by Consumer Reports of top-selling supplements was reassuring on both counts, even for the least expensive brands, but that doesn’t mean that the next batches will be okay—or that other brands on the market are. Last year a test by ConsumerLab.com found no de"

Inupiaq is our word for ""The Real People"" and have been existing in the Northern Most Regions of ""Alaska, Siberia, Canada, Greenland. We all can speak the same Language. Our belief of Good and Evil has existed but not in the sense of putting them into human form...It also has to do with nature and everything in it and man having supreme dominion. With survival of the Fittest...Although their were Shamans that practiced the dark arts to control villages to gain wealth. The Good Shamans practiced healing using the natural plants and chants which were passed down and learned by the tribes. This is a dying art but still shared through the family lineages. I still know my family lineage song and passing it down to my relatives. This is our way...The only other thing I can bring up on the subject is we knew of a creator who was good, then there had to be something evil...It is the law of nature. Me I would like to spend my eternity with my tribe when things were serene before the coming of the white race, who seems to bring nothing but distruction in its path. and destroying the ecosystem of our precious homeland...but a calm serene world with our way of life and one with NATURE.....The evil shamans that once ruled certain villages along the northern coast of Alaska at one time controlled over 8,000 Inuit and amassed wealth and showed no respect. They were eventually killed off when the first Europeons brought Alcohol...When they passed out, the people in fear would butcher the shaman and spread his body so that he could not come back to the village using their magic spells they practiced."

And every so often they change and adapt things in this theory when some scientific fact or discovery comes along and begins to expose it. People did not come from monkeys. A piece or two pieces of nothing did not explode and create everything. And evolution disproves itself. It teaches that the strongest species survives. So if that is so why is man still here? Man isn't the strongest species, but he does think. But the original theories say the strongest not the one that can think. So as I said it disproves itself.

Later, the people asked for an earthly king but the law remained and is still a part of God's covenant with the Jewish people today.\nwhen Jesus came, He observed the law and even more, He fulfilled it. Does that mean it is no longer valid? \nNo, it's still valid. But it's still a covenant between God and the Jewish people. \nWhen the gospel was first preached to Gentiles, some Jewish believers taught, that all Gentiles have to become circumcised and follow the Mosaic law if they want to be followers of Christ.\nThe whole matter is discussed extensively in Acts 15. In the end, the apostles agreed, that Gentiles should not be subject to the law, but that they should be given the following guidelines: abstain from blood, from animals that have been strangled or sacrificed to idols and from sexual immorality. So why do Christians not follow these rules? Because they were not given as a law by God but rather as guidelines by the apostles. \nSo, yes the mosaic law still stands but Gentiles are not required to keep it."

Which is the best chealating thearphy (DMSA , DMPS , BAL , PENCILLAMINE  )  ?\n\n   Which chealeater can remove mercury from  'brain'       effectively (as his central nervous system is   involved)?","I'm a RN who has taught Nursing for over 20 years in numerous clinical settings.  I am so sorry to hear about your father's health problems and I understand your concern about how to best manage the symptoms medically.  You have described his lab results and present symptoms very well.  Except for the constipation which can be quite easily managed, the remainder of his symptoms are significant CNS symptoms causing his brain dysfunction.  I agree with his doctors' provisional diagnosis based on the medical/clinical information you presented and also encourage you to facilitate chelation therapy  for your dad as soon as possible.  BAL is a harmless compound used for binding the mercuric ion to it but the therapeutic usefulness of BAL depends on its immediate administration at the acute onset of the mercury poisoning.   I think that it would be no longer useful for your dad.  I believe that your dad is experiencing chronic mercury poisoning  and Penicillamine may well be the drug of choice.  Penicillamine can be administered orally and appears to chelate mercury selectively, with considerably less effect on copper, which is essential to many metabolic processes.  Your dad's copper level was borderline low so you would want to preserve as much copper as possible which Penicillamine does.  Penicillamine has an advantage of being well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and promotes the excretion of mercury in the urine.  N-Acetyl-dl-penicillamine is even more effective than Penicillamine in protecting against the effects of mercury on the brain, probably because it is more resistant to metabolic degradation, and it has the advantage of being less toxic.  I'm not as familiar with the use of DMSA or DMPS as chelating agents for mercury removal from the brain.  Also you did not mention your dad's kidney function.  Mercury is highly toxic to the kidneys and I suggest that the functioning of his kidneys be evaluated.  I also suggest that your dad be assessed by a neurologist as soon as possible if that has not yet occurred due to the serious CNS symptoms that your dad is presently experiencing.  I wish your dad God's blessings and healing touch.  Good luck to you."

"2","why can't two linear equations in two variables have exactly two solutions???","","More completely, given two lines ax1 + bx2 = c and dx1 + ex2 = f, they can either intersect completely, in which case the solution set is a line, or they can intersect in one point, or they can not intersect at all (parallel lines). This is due to Euclidean geometry.\nIf you're more of an algebraist, suppose they intersected at more than one point (x1, x2) and (y1, y2). Then ax1 + bx2 = ay1 + by2 and dx1 + ex2 = dy1 + ey2. But then (a-d)x1 + (b-e)x2 = (a-d)y1 + (b-e)y2, so (d-a)/(b-e) = (y2-x2)/(y1-x1). Suppose we chose another point (z1, z2) on the line formed by (y1, y2) and (x1, x2). But note that (z1, z2) will also satisfy the equations, hence the entire line satisfies the equations whenever more than one point satisfies the equation. This is just the first case given above (the lines completely overlap). \nNote the degenerate condition (x1,x2)=(y1,y2) of a single solution gives an undefined quotient 0/0."

"3","Why is it that when you see someone yawn, you get the urge to yawn also?","","From what I've read, we are not sure exactly why that happens, but many doctors and scientist believe is is due to a mental reaction that sees a person yawn and believes you should do so as well.  Yawning is a response to a lack of oxygen in the brain under idle conditions, such as standing around or sitting in a chair.  So when you see someone yawn, your brain triggers a yawn to make sure you are also not starving your brain."

It's like you wake up one day, and say...""hey...I'm not so nervous now.""  Lots of things can trigger your bipolar disorder. Have you had a recent upset or something that changed your life?  I was diagnosed shortly after I started my current job - 10 yrs ago.  I went from being a single, unemployed mother with no money and barely enough to live on...to someone who could support herself.  But I didn't know what to ""do.""  And I was afraid I would fail.  I was lost...I had not worked in 2 yrs, had not had a life other than going to the grocery store and doctors offices. But after a couple of months of being on the medication, I felt better, and it was a welcomed change. I actually wanted to go to bed at night so I could get up the next day, go to work, and make a life for myself.  It took about 2 months for it to really take effect though.  It'll be ok.  I think you've just not given it enough time yet.  Good luck, and I hope you feel better soon."

It is indeed a misleading term as you would have noticed since it still does have weight as it is still within a gravitational field.\n\nWeightlessness is a term used to describe the situation when a body (or a person) does not feel 'weighed down' by any force. In Physical terms, this merely means that the body does not experience a Normal reaction force, N. \nThis occurs when a body is falling freely, ie, it is undergoing the same acceleration as the acceleration caused by gravity.\n\nHope this clears up any misconceptions that the people who coined the term 'weightless' caused."

In my opinion it would be hard to find an insurance company that would pay for their removal because it is mainly cosmetic.  You should have your syptoms checked out by a doctor.  I have read many things about having tired and heavy legs and it can in a lot of cases be something pretty serious.  Before you worry about the vein problem please get the symptoms checked out to rule out something potentially hazardous.  Once you have cleared that check up then ask your doctor if he or she has any recommendations for taking care of the veins.  They may be able to refer you to someone."

"1","What was the actual SIN of Sodom & Gamorrah?","Most theist, especially those claiming to be ""christian,"" claim that is was homosexuality when in fact ""homosexuality"" is not even mentioned anywhere in the Genesis 13 account  As a matter of fact, you can read the sin of Sodom in Ezekiel:\n\n "" `Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were ARROGANT, OVEFED and UNCONCERNED; they DID NOT HELP the POOR and NEEDY.  EZE 16:49\n\nIt appears that the people became self indulgent and did not care for the needs of others.  Sounds a lot like most of us in this modern era.  Thank God that Jesus was sent for our redemption.","I think first off you have a wrong idea of what sin is, and so your question becomes difficult to answer.  \n\nSin is often thought of by modern day people as an act that one does that God does not approve of.  This is a fine definition in some respects, however when one begins to speak of God, this definition is hardly adequate, because it leaves open the possibility of one being able not to sin, which scripture clearly teaches against.  Sin could better be defined, (as it was in the ancient church) as separation from God, or even as a loss of the ""image of God"" which was bestowed upon Adam and Eve at their creation.  When one thinks of sin in those terms there is not a specific sin that caused God to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, instead there is a lack of faith, or realtionship with God.  This faith, or Relationship comes from the promise of God given to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:15-16, that One will come from Eve's womb whom Satan will pierce but who will crush Satan's head.  Only when God works through that means can one have faith, which none had in Sodom and Gomorrah.  Further more, when one looks at the book of Matthew (25:40ff) one understands what Ezekiel was saying.  With out faith, one cannot do good works to serve their neighbor.  However at the time when God puts Himself into relationship with man, everything that they do is a good work, and consequently, in their faith relationship they are not arrogant, overfed, unconcerned, and they help the poor and needy.  \n\nIn the end you are right with your last statement in the question: ""It appears that the people became self indulgent and did not care for the needs of others. Sounds a lot like most of us in this modern era. Thank God that Jesus was sent for our redemption."""

"2","does anybody know what a heat shock does or what it is?","","Heat shock ot thermal shock, is the effect heating or cooling has on an object. Think of a car engine. Every time you start it, the temperature of the engine goes from ambient to a few hundred degrees. It's like hitting it with a huge hammer every time you start it. This shock could effect the material in different ways, just like heating an object does. Steel will become more and more brittle, aluminum looses strength.\nAlso, thermal shock can happen when an object is heated unevenly. An iron bar heated on one end will cause it to expand on the heated end. The cooler end will not expand as much as you heat the bar. The uneven heating causes stresses as part of the bar expands and part doesn't."

"1","Would it be a good idea to burn my old Bibles?","Im thinking the smoke will eventually find its way to Heaven, which is pretty comforting and doesnt make me feel bad about burning them.

(dont laugh, im not KKK, im serious). I think itd be a neat little offering.","RATHER THAN BURNING THEM DONATE THEM TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT CAN USED THEM TO TEACH OTHERS THAT THERE IS A GOD AND THAT ALL SCRIPTURE IS THE HOLY INSPIRATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD FATHER OF US ALL .IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT OFFERING TO GOD OFFER YOURSELF TO HIM AND THAT WILL PLEASE HIM.HE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OFFERING AND WILL BECOME YOUR ETERNAL GUIDING LIGHT AND SHOW YOU HIS GLORY WHICH WILL CONVINCE YOU OF WHO HE IS AND OF WHO YOU ARE.IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AND OFFERING THAT'S PLEASING TO GOD SEEK HIM IN PRAYER AND ASK HIM WHAT YOU SHOULD DO WITH ALL THOSE BIBLES,HE WILL INDICATE TO YOU WHAT STEP TO TAKE AND THAT, MY FRIEND WILL BE YOUR 1ST. STEP IN WALKING TOWARDS SALVATION.I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WANT TO BURN WHAT CAN SAVE YOU  OR SAVE OTHERS.PLEASE FIND A BETTER WAY TO MAKE AND OFFERING,DON'T OFFER TO OFFEND THE HOLY SPIRIT OF FATHER GOD.JUST BY RECONSIDERING THE QUESTION YOU POSE YOU WILL BE OPENING YOURSELF TO THE GRACE OF GOD.IF YOU DECIDED TO BURN THOSE  BIBLES YOU WOULD BE OFFERING TO BURN WISDOM THAT CAN COME TO YOU.THE BEST OFFERING YOU CAN MAKE IS TO OFFER HIM THE SPACE IN YOUR HEART,OFFER HIM YOUR PAIN FOR HIS GRACE HE WILL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT DEAL INSTANTLY.HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO MAKES THOSE TYPES OF DEAL,INSTANTLY PEACE,MERCY LOVE ABUNDANCE OF FEAR OF GOD WILL FILL YOU AND WILL REMAIN WITH YOU FOR EVER.HE LOVES YOU A WOULD RATHER HAVE YOUR HEART IN OFFERRING THAN THE BURNT BIBLES.

It was based on fictional characters which are immoral and gross. Totally against the values the Bible advocates."

"1","what religion(s) beside Christianity evangelize because they care about other people's souls?","If anyone has anything to say like ""Christians dont care bout other peoples souls"" then dont even bother putting an answer.","Only the christian sects evangelize, with the exception of Catholics.  Good Christians do care for others souls but through my own personal experience, most should practice the ""remove the board from your own eye, before removing the mote in your neighbors"".  I myself cannot stand to be preached at.  I feel that any religion that has to push itself onto people to prove themselves to be right should look at 2 non-evangelical religions for evidence that it is not neccessary: they are the Jewish faiths and true Islam (not the militant fanaticism).  They have out grown Christianity as the largest practices religions.  However the oldest is that of the Pagan sects.  It has continued to flourish and grow in spite of oppressive evangelical religions.  Why? because we keep to ourselves and just practicing being the best we can in our daily lives.  Realizing that we must be good to ourselves before we can do good for others, and without religious overtones.  That is true good works, when it is done because it needs to be and not in the name of a religion."
"2","According to the Bible,earth is 6000 years old and then the science fact is : the earth 65 Billion years old?","","Scientific evidence suggests that the Earth is actually around 4 billion years old.  We have shown that many fossils are more than 6000 years old by using carbon-testing and other accurate tests.  We have used geological evidence as well.  Thus, that prediction of the Bible is probably incorrect, although that doesn't mean that you should disregard the Bible."

"2","Now that Easter is over, the age old question remains, which came firest the chicken or the egg?","","my guess is that the egg did, since the animal that laid the egg was lower on the evolutionary scale.If you read new articles, we are constantly coming up with new creature fossils that  try to prove whether or not (or when) sea animals crawled on land or learned to fly.\nI believe the egg was the freakish change that eventually became whatever animal comes from the eggshell, be it snake or bird."

"3","When Otitis media was discovered?","","(also known as glue ear) is an inflammation of the middle ear segment of the ear. It is usually associated with a buildup of fluid and frequently causes an earache. The fluid may or may not be infected.Types\n\nThere are several kinds of otitis media:\n\n   1. Acute otitis media is an infection that produces pus, fluid, and inflammation within the middle ear. It is frequently associated with signs of upper respiratory infection, such as a runny nose or stuffy nose. It is often associated with Mastoiditis.\n   2. Otitis media with effusion is the presence of middle ear fluid for six weeks or more from the initial acute otitis media.\n   3. Chronic otitis media may develop when the infection persists for more than two weeks.\n   4. "" Adhesive Otitis Media""\n\n[edit]\n\nProgression\n\nThe typical progress of otitis media is: the tissues surrounding the Eustachian tube swell due to an infection and/or severe congestion. The Eustachian tube remains blocked most of the time. The air present in the middle ear is slowly absorbed into the surrounding tissues. A strong negative pressure creates a vacuum in the middle ear. The vacuum reaches a point where fluid from the surrounding tissues accumulates in the middle ear. This is seen as a progression from a Type A tympanogram, to a Type C, to a Type B tympanogram. The fluid may become infected. It has been found that dormant bacteria behind the Tympanum (eardrum) multiply when the conditions are ideal infecting the middle ear fluid.\n[edit]\n\nCauses\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common bacterial causes of otitis media. Still, antibiotics are rarely effective in shortening disease duration.[citation needed] Tubal dysfunction leads to the ineffective clearing of bacteria from the middle ear.\n\nAs well as being caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae it can also be caused by the colds.\n\nAnother common culprit of otitis media includes Moraxella catarrhalis, a gram negative, aerobic, oxidase positive diplococcus.\n[edit]\n\nSusceptibility in children\n\nChildren below the age of seven years are much more prone to otitis media since the Eustachian tube is shorter and at a different angle than that of the adult ear. They also have not developed the same resistance to viruses and bacteria as adults.\n[edit]\n\nTreatment\n\nSurgery is sometimes performed to insert a grommet (called a ""tympanostomy tube"") into the eardrum to allow air to pass through into the middle ear, and thus release any pressure buildup and help clear excess fluid within."

Just walk away. \n\nNow that you have lost your belief, religion and the church are an irrelevance and a curiosity. They have no legal claim to you. If they do send you stuff just asked to be removed from their lists. You may have friends from church - if they respect you and are open to other ideas they will remain your friends now that you have left. If they don't they clearly weren't worth the effort anyway. \n\nGo out, see the world, experience the world for what it is rather than through the dark glasses that religion forces upon you. It is much more beautiful that way."

I was under the impression that it's the hormones in birth control that help with acne, does this mean the patch would work just as well?","No. Patches are made specificaly for their purpose. It has been my experience that the pill and patch both produce more acne in women and weight gain as well due to the imbalance of hormones created. The birth control pill is NOT good for you. \n\nFurther problems can develope such as mood swings, depression, anxiety and liver disorders and toxicity are also some other side effects of these hormone based products.\n\nJust in case you have not tried any dietary supplementation here are a few well known ones for acne as well as some back ground info on acne. You sound like you have been through the wringer with cures and I am guessing you have tried plenty so this is really just in case.\n\nACNE\n \n \nAcne is usually considered an adolescent affliction affecting up to 80 percent of teenagers. Although acne occurs most commonly in adolescent males, it can affect people of any age.\n\nSymptoms\nAcne vulgaris, the most common form of acne, consists of whiteheads, blackheads, pimples and deep cysts that appear mainly on the face and to a lesser extent on the chest, shoulders and back. \n\nAcne is often worse during winter, improving during summer. \n\n\nCauses\nAcne commences when the sebaceous ducts in the skin become blocked by skin overgrowth to form a whitehead, or by plugs of sebum which darken on exposure to air forming a blackhead. \n\n\nWhen the sebum trapped in the whitehead or blackhead is forced into the deeper skin layers, an inflammatory reaction causes a red lump called a papule. If infection follows, pus collects and the classic pimple (pustule) is seen. When the inflammatory condition is severe, large, painful cysts may form.\n\n\nAcne is associated with hormonal imbalance, and will typically develop during puberty when hormonal activity increases the size and activity of the sebaceous glands. Some women also experience acne as a component of pre-menstrual syndrome.\n\n\nThe naturopathic view is that acne is aggravated by ineffective elimination from the body, which may be related to a build up of toxins in the system due to an inability of the liver to effectively break down circulatory toxins. It can also be initiated by food sensitivities, poor diet and stress.\n\n\n\nNatural Therapies\n\n\n\n\nZinc is an essential mineral used for wound healing and the normal oil gland function of the skin. It is also involved in the maintenance of vitamin A levels, transport and usage; for protein synthesis, (particularly collagen synthesis); and to help maintain hormonal balance. \n\nBeta-carotene is transformed into vitamin A in the body. These two nutrients act as skin antioxidants, and may be of assistance in the treatment of acne, other skin conditions, and the healing of wounds. \n\nSulphur is traditionally indicated as a liver tonic to support the body's detoxification processes, and for a variety of skin conditions including acne which are associated with sluggish liver function \n\nEchinacea has been extensively investigated and has been found to have a variety of actions on the immune system, including antibacterial and antiviral activity. \n\nCalendula has traditionally been used for the treatment of skin infection and to assist wound healing. \n\nVitex Agnus-Castus is indicated for acne problems which are worse pre-menstrually.\n \nPrevention\nThere are conflicting theories about direct dietary influences on acne. \n\nThe best approach is to adopt a healthy well balanced diet high in fibre, filtered water and fresh fruits and vegetables. Avoid refined or processed foods, sugars and high-fat foods. \n\n\nRegular exercise is great for your skin, as it improves your circulation and aids in the removal of toxins. Try brisk walking, jogging swimming or any active sport 3 - 4 times per week.\n \nHope this helps.\n\nCraig - Naturopath."

"2","How do hand warmers work?","I went skiing the other day and used some hand warmers.  I noticed that the instructions indicated simply to expose the warmers to the air, and that the ingredients listed an iron compound, among others.  I suppose this compound undergoes some sort of exothermic reaction involving oxidation once exposed to the air, but I was wondering if anyone knew the specific reaction?","Hand warmers are small (sometimes disposable) packets which are held in the hand and produce heat on demand to warm cold hands.\n\nThey are commonly used in outdoor activities such as hiking and skiing to keep the extremities warm and assist insulated clothing. Other types of warmers are available to provide soothing heat for muscular or joint aches.\n\nSome hand warmers contain cellulose, iron, water, activated carbon, vermiculite and salt and produce heat from the exothermic oxidisation of iron when exposed to air.\n\nA second type generate heat through exothermic crystallisation of supercooled molten materials (usually sodium acetate) and are reusable. These can be recharged by boiling the warmers and allowing them to cool. Heating of the pads is triggered by snapping a small metal device buried in the pad which generates shock waves to initiate crystallisation.\n\nA third type uses lighter fluid (lighter fuel) or LPG which is reacted with a platinum catalyst to release heat by oxidation reactions. These can be used on many occasions by simply refuelling.\n\nDepending on the type and the source of heat, hand warmers last between 30 minutes (recrystallisation) though to 12 - 24 hours."

The Nyquist bandwidth constraint is that the minimum required bandwidth W for a symbol rate Rs without inter-symbol interference is Rs/2 Hz.  That assumes a bandpass filter which is not achievable in the real world.  A more general formula is W= [Rs(1+r)]/2.  In this formula, ""r"" is the roll-off factor of the filter.\n\nThis is equation 3.80 in the reference in ""source(s)""."

It was a sort of backlash against all the gangster rap, and the negativity and violence that went along with that.  Hyphey is its own culture, with its own music, and its own terminology.  There are some odd seeming rituals, such as ""ghosting,"" where people all get out of a car, and let it idle slowly down the street, while they walk along side--it looks as no one is driving the car because no one is--or its being driven by a ghost.  The culture has a lot to do with partying, love, support of friendships, bonds, and seeking a high or euphoria not so much from alcohol or drug use (but that is still quite part of it,) but more from the experience itself.  It really is in many ways, sort of a very modern, rap-like resurrection of the hippy life-style, or at least those ideals.  There are some excellent articles on the internet if you are a reader.

We were at it for about a half an hour and she was really getting in and massaging my sore muscles very deep.

"2","Oxygen fuels fires, but a gust of wind will blow out a candle - why is this so?","","In a fire, Oxygen is not the fuel, it is the oxidizer.  Depending upon what is burning, the fuel could be any number of things.\nOxygen does not burn, but is required for combustion.\n\nIn order for something to burn, 3 things are necessary,\n-Fuel\n-An oxidizer (Oxygen)\n-[activation] Energy\n\nUnless these 3 things are present, the object in question will not burn.\nIf we assume fuel and Oxidizer are plentiful, then the only thing left which will keep something from burning is that extra bit of energy needed to set off the reaction.  After one gets a fire going, usually, this energy is provided by the excess heat the fire generates, but it needs to be supplied initially by some form (for example, lighting a match to start light a candle).\nIf one were to take away the fire's ability to provide its own activation energy, it would go out unless supplemented by some outside source.\n\nWhen a gust of wind blow out a fire, it is blowing away the energy the fire needs to burn, it is cooling it off too much for it to continue burning."

In education, for example, anyone who wants to work in a school must undertake a criminal background check.  The problem is with people who are paedophiles, or potential paedophiles but who have no criminal record.  There is also a problem with people who have been suspected but never convicted, in a legal system that has a presumption of innocence until guilt is proven.

The area where the clot forms usually is tender, red, and warm, although not always. DVT's are pretty easily treated, but you will need to be diagnosed before treatment can begin. Although, the clot may appear to be just a bother, a clot that has gone untreated can dislodge and travel to other parts of the body such as the heart, the lungs, or the brain.

"1","For Christians only, is going to heaven the same as inheriting the kingdom of God?","1 Cor 6:9 says that the unrighteous (ie unbelievers) will not inherit the kingdom of God.  The unrighteous cannot inherit because they are not sons of God which believers are.\nGal 5:19-21 says that those who do the works of the flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God.  Here believers who sin (ie engaged in the works of the flesh)\ncannot inherit the kingdom of God.  Believers who are sons of God are disqualified from their inheritance because of sins.\nIn Rom 14:17  Apostle Paul defines the kingdom of God to be righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\nA believer who sins is not disqualified from going to heaven but he would not inherit the kingdom of God in the sense that he will not enjoy righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.  I have consistently used the writings of Paul\nto come to this conclusion.  Any helpful comments, brothers and sisters in the Lord ?","Yes indeed.I was studying these issues myself.Here's my conviction.Justification is only by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and it is once and for all.Let God be true and man a liar.The transaction is done once and for all.The seal is done and no one can steal it from Christ.However,if you read the book of Revelation along with Daniel you will see that in the white throne judgement the believers in Christ and those who have rejected Christ will be separated by Christ himself like sheep is separated from goats.Which is a very sad thing and that is the reason why we Christians are supposed to be the salt of  the earth and light.So we (The believers in Christ )escape the final judgement.But all is not over.Now starts the judgement of the believers---do we enter heaven with honour or in dishonour?That is question we all need to ask now.Imagine living the rest of our lives in dishonour.Do we have any crowns to lay at His feet as our worship in eternity or not ,or shall we go empty handed standing before the Lord,with our heads hanging in shame???That is why Paul refers our life on earth like that of an athelete---breasting the tape alone will not determine our award but whether we are following the rules applicable;if an athelete does not follow rules of the race then imagine after running the race and comming 1st only to be told publicly he is disqualified for the award.That is very sad indeed!!!There are many more illustrations from every day life given in the Bible from which we all can understand simply.I believe God did not give His Word to us to keep it as a secret,his love for mankind was made a public spectacle when Christ gave his life on the cross willingly (and yet the world rejects it so much tragecally!!)so that you and I and all those who believe may not perish but have everlasting life.We are now co-heirs with Christ, therefore we inherit the Kingdom of heaven, not because of our deeds but by the act of Christ on the Cross.He gave us the authority to His children therefore we will live with him in heaven after our life on earth is over.Capture the image of the scene of the rupture!!!Oh! Death where is your sting!!!It is so powerful.He loves people His creation that he does not want even one to perish but it is we who reject His salvation for mankind.Jesus is a thorough gentleman, he never forces His way into anyone's life.His love is for the asking only.His heart is to preserve. I love The Word of God because it is so alive and speaking to me even in this decade.I also trust that  even as you seek the many question if you seek with all your heart He shall reveal it and The Truth shall set you free indeed.So the bottom line is whether we will enter heaven in honour or in shame?Amen."

I'm having a difficult time understanding the difference between the different accents in England before the Norman conquest and the different dialects in England after the Norman conquest.  Could someone help explain the difference between accents and dialects?  My dictionary only says that accents are different styles of pronunciation and dialects are different forms of pronunciation... and this still leaves me confused.","Yes, I can see why you would be confused by your dictionary's definition on this topic.\n\nAccent refers to the sounds that are present in a person's language.  Pronunciation is basically a synonym of accent.  Therefore, if I pronounce differently from someone, I have a different accent.\n\nDialect is something greater.  A dialect is a version of a language that is special to a particular region or group.  Dialects of the same language are different from each other, but still understandable to speakers of another dialect of that language.  For example, American English and British English are two dialects of English.  They have some differences, such as in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but they are still understandable to each other.\n\nIn your specific question, then, differences between dialects includes more than just differences in pronunciation.  I suppose that the reason your dictionary isn't precise on this is that accent(pronunciation) is often a pretty noticeable feature of dialect.  In other words, if I am interacting with a speaker of another dialect of my language, I will probably notice it first because of the differences in accent."

"3","how do you gain weight fast?i am 67 kg,1-81 cm and i need at least 10 more kilos?","","Follow the sumo diet.\n\n1. Skip breakfast. By depriving their bodies of food after eight hours of sleep, their metabolic rates stay low.\n\n2. Exercise on an empty stomach. If their bodies have\nno food, their metabolic thermostats are turned down even lower to conserve fuel.\n\n3. Take a nap after eating. The Sumo secret for gaining weight is that, after eating, they sleep for at least four hours.\n\n4. Eat late in the day. Going to bed with full stomachs means that their bodies must respond to the huge flood of nutrients with a rush of insulin, forcing their bodies to store some of it in the cells as fat instead of in the muscles and organs as nutrients.\n\n5. Always eat with others in a social atmosphere. According to leading researchers, a meal eaten with others can be at least 44 percent larger and with 30 percent more calories and fat."

Engineers use imagination, judgment, and reasoning to apply science, technology, mathematics, and practical experience.

"2","what are the steps in tea processing?","","The plucked tea is weighed before being taken to the factory for processing or “making”, as tea manufacture is known in the trade. Some 30-35 kg (66-77 lb) of plucked leaf makes some 7.5-9 kg (17-20 lb) of black tea, which is the type of tea that has the major share of the market in terms of production, sales, and consumption.\n\nThere are five stages in the tea-making process. Withering is the first stage, in which the plucked leaf is spread on vast trays or racks, and left to wither in air temperatures of 25-30° C (77-86° F) for a period of 10-16 hours, depending on the wetness of the leaf. As the leaf moisture evaporates the leaves become flaccid. In the next stage, the withered leaf is broken by machine, releasing the natural leaf juices. The broken leaf is produced by “orthodox” and “unorthodox” mechanized methods, the orthodox method producing larger leaf particles, or grades, and the unorthodox method producing smaller grades. These smaller grades are more suited to modern market demands for a quick-brewing finished product.\n\nDuring the fermentation stage, the broken leaf is spread on trays or put in troughs. On contact with the air, the released enzymes (from the leaf juices) oxidize. The leaf is turned from time to time until each tray or trough is full of a rusty-brown coloured leaf. Drying, often called firing, is the next stage. The fermented leaf is fed slowly through a warm air chamber, which extracts the moisture, emerging as a dark brown dried leaf, known as black tea.\n\nDuring the final stage, known as sorting, the black tea is fed into a machine fitted with a series of sieves and outlets. This sorts the grades into chests before its onward journey to auctions, traders, or blenders. The chests are foil-lined to prevent the absorption of unpleasant odours or the loss of aroma during shipment. In China, tea is sometimes allowed to absorb the scent from various flowers; jasmine is a particular favourite.\n\nThere are two main grades—pekoe and broken pekoe (the word “pekoe” is a corruption of the Chinese word for the white down found on the back of young leaves). Each grade is subdivided into further categories as the leaf particles decline in size. Fannings and dust grades are the two smallest particles. Other terms are used to describe the colour and content of the black tea leaf. For example, Broken Orange Pekoe and Tippy Broken Orange Pekoe are the names given to teas with a lot of bud in the blend, as the buds tend to turn an orange colour during the make.\n\nBefore the tea is shipped, factory tea-tasters sample the finished make to ensure no mistakes have been made during manufacture. These tasters also send samples of the make to their brokers, agents, and buyers. At the end of each make the factory is washed thoroughly to ensure that the completed make does not contaminate the next."
"3","How much does your metabolic rate increase when eating a 90-100% organic, balanced healthy diet?","By this, with physical activity being a constant, does you metabolism increase when eating the same organic healthy foods in comparison to processed healthy foods?  By what percentage?","It can, but not very much, maybe like 5-10% more. =-(\nEating healthier can help flush out the causes of a slowed metabolism, i.e., the clogging from refined bread and sugars and such, and this can help your metabolic rate increase a little due to an easier way of metabolizing the food you eat since it's healthier. But not much. \nIf you want to flush out your system and cleanse it without much work in preparation for a new, healthy diet, may I reccomend raw, organic apple cider vinegar, preferably Bragg's brand, @ least 1 tablespoon in 8oz water before each meal every day. This will set your body metabolism and all its function straight and help your metabolism increase as well! \nHope I helped some =-)"

"3","Does poison ivy spread by scratching the rash?  Can it spread from person to person?","I have been told that it cannot spread to another person, but I have also been told that it can spread by scratching it.","• The best way to avoid getting a rash from poison ivy, oak or sumac is to stay away from the plants. You can't get a rash from just standing near a patch of poison ivy ­ the urushiol oil in the plants, which causes the rash, can only transfer to your skin by direct contact.\n\n• However, your pet can run through a patch of poison ivy, oak or sumac and get the urushiol on its fur. Then when the animal jumps up on you, or you pet it the urushiol can transfer to your skin. Dogs seem to be immune to the oil, but many a dog lover has developed a serious rash from the oil on his pet's fur.\n\n• Avoid burning poison ivy, oak or sumac. Poison ivy vines often grow around trees and can be easily overlooked and tossed into a campfire. The smoke can carry the urushiol oil into your respiratory system causing serious allergic reactions inside your nose, throat and lungs. If you believe you have inhaled smoke from burning poison ivy, see a doctor immediately, the allergic reaction can be very serious.\n\n• If you are going to be hiking in a wooded area where these plants live, wear protective clothing ­ long-sleeved shirts, long pants tucked into your socks or boots and cloth or leather gloves. There are some barrier creams that have been shown to help prevent the oil from getting on your skin.\n\n• If you get the oil on your skin, wash as soon as possible with lots and lots of cool water. The sooner you wash, and the more water you use, the less likely you will be of getting a rash.\n\n• Although a number of studies have been done on treating the rashes, no one has proven that any home remedies really work. The most common suggestions are to apply calamine lotion to the rash or rub the rash with an ice cube. These remedies may or may not work, but they probably won't cause any harm.\n\n• If the rash covers more than 20 percent of your body, or develops in sensitive areas like the eyes, mouth or genitals, see a doctor immediately. Physicians can prescribe steroids in either cream form or by injections that may decrease the allergic reaction. Extremely sensitive people may need to be hospitalized.\n \nExcerpted from Woodall's Monthly Regional RV/Camping Publications."

Instead of lifting the load through a vertical height 'h' we are moving the load through a longer distace 'l' along the plane.\nIn any machine work will be the same.\nWork is the product of force and distance.\nIf the load is moved vertically we would have done a work Wxh.\nBut in inclined plane we move the effort P through a distance l . Work done is Pxl\n But P x l = W x h \nSince l is greater than h, P is less than w.\nTherefore \nAn inclined plane reduces the effort force by increasing the distance through which the force is applied\n\nIn your choise the second and fourth answer is  wrong\nas  no  (ideal) machine can increase or reduce our work.

"1","How many times do christen people finishes the bible?","I mean in Islam, Muslims finishes The Quran at lest every month or two and in Ramadan (month) some Muslims finishes the Quran more than 3 time.\nWhat about Christian people do they do that?","I'm sure many do.

And in both religions, I think there needs to be a distinction between simply reading all the words and trying to understand and absorb what the book is telling you.

I want to prevent further pain,I do not want to deteriorate,Im still young enough to want to have a long full life,there has to be a way, a cure.a breakthrough. I await your response.","There are a few different types of arthritis but the one you have is probably ""osteoarthritis"". Osteoarthritis is inflammation due to degenerative changes from excessive loading of the articular surfaces of the joint. In your case, this has most likely occured due to your prior injuries, which places more stress on the cartilage in your knee, leading to degeneration and pain.\n\nThere is no true cure for this disease, however various surgical and medical means exist that may relieve your symptoms or slow progression.\n\nSurgery: If ligaments or the meniscus were torn in your old injury, surgical repair can restore some measure or congruity to the articular surfaces thereby reducing the progression of osteoarthritis. More drastic surgical measures include total knee replacement or osteotomies.\nMedical: Various types of anti-inflammatory drugs are worth trying and can relieve pain as well as reduce swelling. Newer drugs called glucosamines have come into the market which claim to slow the degeneration or even promote repair of the joint lining, although concrete evidence for these claims is controversial.\n\nThe best thing you can do now is to avoid straining your knees too much. Exercise can strengthen the muscles around the knee and improve your condition. However, take care to avoid high impact activities such as long-distance running etc. Swimming and cycling are very good alternatives to consider."

"3","why does a red cross check for iron before donating blood?","i had an appointment to donate platelet today and I had a check up before donating.  they said that my iron is low.  what happens if it is low? what do I have to do? this is my second time i got it low. the first time i had 37% and today i got 36%.  the normal iron is 38% or over","Though they may call that test that, they are NOT checking for iron.\n\nThe test is technically called a 'hematocrit' and is intended to test the amount of red blood cells in your blood.  This test is required by law, though the actual form of the test may vary depending on where you are going.  For accurate results like you're desribing, they probably centrifuged your blood and measured the volume directly.\n\nThere are lots of things which can affect the amount of red blood cells you have kicking around, and one of the more common problems is an iron deficiency.  This is probably why it is often referred to as 'checking your iron'.  Other things include illness, bleeding, and sometimes just a natural tendancy in some people to have less.\n\nNow... I can tell what you're thinking.  ""If I'm giving PLATELETS, what difference does it make if I don't have enough red blood cells.  I get everything but the platelets back, right?""  And this is completely true.  Usually.  The wrinkle is that the apheresis machine which separates out your platelets usually has about a half a litre of your blood in it while it's operating.  If something should go wrong, either in the machine or if you have a reaction, they may have to just pull the needle from your arm and you'll be out that much blood.  So they want to make sure you have enough to lose!\n\nAnd just as there are things that lower the amount of red blood cells you have circulating, there are also things that raise it.  Making sure you're eating enough iron is a good one... but be careful with this.  Iron in large amounts can be toxic, and vitamin C eaten at the same time can interfere with your digestion of iron.  Donating whole blood regularly can prompt your system to overproduce red blood cells a little bit to compensate.  Likewise with spending time at high altitudes.  Female people may just want to schedule such appointments before instead of after their 'time of the month'.\n\nHope all that helps!  Don't get discouraged... lots of people end up with a low hematocrit from time to time.  Donating is a GREAT thing!"

This is only my second relationship.","I don't know that I quite understand all of your question.  What are you saying about your boyfriend masturbating?  Are you worried that because he masturbates, he's not horny enough to have more sex with you?  Believe me, masturbation doesn't change your sex drive; it merely takes care of it.  If he has enough desire to masturbate, he's got enough to have sex with you.\n\nAs for oral . . . no, not all men like to do it.  Some dislike the smell/taste, some find it difficult to do (I've heard things like complaints of tongue cramping, believe it or not), some feel it's beneath them (that a 'real man' can satisfy his woman through penetration alone), some merely don't care about her orgasm and won't do the work for it, some are nervous or feel inexperienced and don't want to do it because they're scared of failing (they don't know how to locate the clitoris; and some women are slightly hard to get off).  Or it's just not really their thing.  A lot of guys love to do it, but a lot don't, too.\n\nI can't say if your boyfriend's gay; you'll have to decide that.  But, if it's worth anything, there are straight males out there who masturbate often, don't like to perform oral sex on women, and don't have sex as often enough as their wives/girlfriends would like.\n\nHope that helps."

( medically disease accurately shows this ) \n\n2.  thought is probably ""stored"" in the brain ( memories retrieved and amnesia )\n\n3.  thought may not exist at all but may be an illusion to which we assign a word ""thought"" .  this illusion is actually the process of the elecrohemical reactions themselves. this illusion is abolished when you sleep or are unconscious.  \n\n4. this illusion is called consciousness and is more metaphysical in nature.  ( i.e not a subject for the sciences ).\n\n5. i believe consciousness is a subjective experience which in some individuals opens an infinity of questions and in others be a solved problem ( e.g. state of nirvana or cosmic union ). in other words, its a matter of accepting a belief.\n\n6. i dont think your question can be approach rationally since the question itself is a thought .  in other words,  the answer to what a thought is made of is only another thought and so on ad infinitum.......\n\n7.  you may want to read ""the physics of consciousness"" for a good scientific survey of your question.\n\n:)"

Of course, it is extremely unlikely that everyone taking part in the study lost 10 pounds.  ""Average"" implies that some people lost more and some people lost less.  If ""average"" is the mean average, it could be that a small number of people who lost a lot of weight could have distorted the average.  Knowing the median weight loss might be very revealing.\n\nIt would be good to know how long each person used the machine for and what other exercise were they doing.

Some states have a higher cost of living than others, so the procedure will be more.  Endodontists are going to cost more than general dentists because they are specialists and the further back in the mouth you go, the more the root canal is going to cost because molars, for example, have more canals than an incisor does.\n\nJust for a rough estimate, it will cost between $400 - $1200."

We do celebrate it just because, because  of the wonderful things She does. I like any excuse for a holiday too. We enjoy the set ones like Thanksgiving ( Canadian in Oct. and American in Nov. ) and Christmas, then make more up if they don't come quickly enough for our liking. An example would be celebrating Wednesday, a very important day to us just because; LOL; because of the wonderful things She does!"

"2","What is geology?","","Geology is the science and study of the Earth, its composition, structure, physical properties, history and the processes that shape it. It is one of the Earth sciences. Geologists have helped establish the age of the Earth at about 4.6 billion  years, and have determined that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust, is fragmented into tectonic plates that move over a rheic upper mantle (asthenosphere) via processes that are collectively referred to as plate tectonics. Geologists help locate and manage the earth's natural resources, such as petroleum and coal, as well as metals such as iron, copper, and uranium. Additional economic interests include gemstones and many minerals such as asbestos, perlite, mica, phosphates, zeolites, clay, pumice, quartz, and silica, as well as elements such as sulfur, chlorine, and helium.\n\nAstrogeology refers to the application of geologic principles to other bodies of the solar system. However, specialised terms such as selenology (studies of the Moon), areology (of Mars), etc., are also in use.\n\nThe word ""geology"" was first used by Jean-André Deluc in the year 1778 and introduced as a fixed term by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in the year 1779. An older meaning of the word was first used by Richard de Bury. He used it to distinguish between earthly and theological jurisprudence."

"2","Why does load music make your ears ring?","I went to a Gig last night and came out with my ears ringing - they were still ringing the next morning! Why do your ears ring after a gig and does it do any permanent damage?","Taken from Anderson, Brett, The treble and the damage done…\nVol. 20, Twin Cities Reader, 01-11-1995, pp 15. Sometimes my ears ring dull and low. I hear something that sounds like a cross between the hum of a Hammond organ and the purr of a well-tuned luxury car. Other times the noise is a faint, high squeal that alternately surges and recedes like surf. Most often, my head hisses like the inside of seashell, causing a cool sensation that feels like my ears are leaking gas. As unpredictable as the nature of my own private echoes might be, it’s certain that I will awake from a night spent sucking down loud rock music with a hangover that has nothing to do with booze.\n\nI’m not alone.\n\n“What happens is the hair cells are damaged, but they’re not dead,” Dr. Sam Levine (an otolarynologist) explains. “As they’re damaged, you lose some of your hearing. Most of the time, if you get out of the environment, your hair cells will recover somewhat. Each day, it [your hearing] comes back, but not as good as it did the day before. Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged instead of temporarily damaged.”\n\nMost people would rather believe that hearing loss is like car accidents, violent crime and tax audits - something that affects other people. There are some famous cases. Who guitarist"

They've been doing it for years. Most people think they're serious nutjobs. I'm a Catholic, and I prefer my religion to be a bit more sutble than that. Let God sort out the sinners; it's not in my job description."
"2","Why is some ocean water in specific regions very clear and some very dirty?","","Clear water needn't be clean water (chemically), it only has few solids floating in it.\n\nHow clear water can be depends on a variety of factors.\n\nPlankton: even clear water contains myriads of microbial plankton. Most of it is colourless, but algae have various dyes used for changing light energy into chemical energy. Algae can bloom where the temperatures are right, there are enough nutrients, and there is sufficient light.\n\nClay minerals: Marine sediment as well as riverine detritus contains finely ground minerals which can be stirred up by even slight mechanical force. How much and which grain size can and will be stirred up depends on wave action and sediment make-up. Rocky or large-particle beaches will have clearer water than muddy beaches with the same conditions.\n\nWhat can be blamed on human influence? Mainly the nutrient contents of the water, mostly from agricultural fertilizers and to a somewhat lesser content waste water from settlements or industry. Plus occasional severe cases of extreme pollution like oil etc.\n\nHow clear the water appears is only one of several quality criteria. There won't be many algae in sea water polluted by biocides, but though clear that water won't be pure..."
"2","Does the change in enviroment cause the organisms that live on a rotting log die or run away?","This is the question.While walking ina forested area one day with her pupils,Mdm Tan found a rotting log on the ground.Upon a closer look,she disovered that it had a number of organisms crawling on its surface,some growing on it and others hidden in it.//Mdm Tan was delighted as she felt that this could be used as a specimen to teach her class about rotting log community Also other teachers could also use it to teach their class.//After bringing  the rotting log back with the help of her pupils,Mdm Tan placed it at the back of the class,ona table near the window.//Unfortunately,2 days later,the rotting log could no longer be used as a specimen.Most of the organisms had died and some had disappeared.//What happened?What could Mdm Tan do to keep the rotting log in the same condition as she first found it?","Yes, if you take something thats adapt to its enviroment and place it in a different enviroment it will die, or try to find a suitable enviroment. This is only with organisms that are weaker then some and cant adapt fast enough. Often the most simple organism is the strongest, without heating and air conditioning humans would have alot of problems with moving, even from the central united states to the southern states. In the past, thousands of people died from a heat wave that swept accross the US, and the tempuratures werent that high, if you are use to the mid/southern states. But it was in the northern states that it happened."
"1","Who exactly is Allah?","Ok, I know that Allah means God, and he is who Muslims pray to. But is Allah the same God that Christians pray to? I know that Muslims beleive in Moses and in Jesus, but they also believe in Mohammend. Muslims believe in Mohammend the same way that Christians believe in Jesus right? So if Muslims beleive in Jesus and Moses, then is Allah and God the exact same person/entity? Or is Allah totally seperate, like Buddah is? I am confused.","First of all, I am happy for you because of asking this question, since you are asking about none but your Creator, and as to your question.. well..\n\nLet us agree first that The Creator must be the creator of\neverything, the heavens, the earth an all that is in between them, mankind and all that exists. It is anticipated that anyone who says\n“I believe in the Creator,” that he believes in this. It also entails that he should necessarily believe that the Creator possesses Perfect Attributes. He is Perfect in His attributes, in Himself, in His Names,and in His Actions. This is a natural flow,\notherwise, it is a delusion not a true belief in the ""Creator.""\n""I believe in a Perfect Creator,"" should lead to another obvious admission: if you believe that the Creator is Perfect then He is\nPerfectly Wise in all of His Actions. Does He then Create because of a Perfect Wisdom, or aimlessly? This is the important linkage. Does He Create for a need? Or He\nCreates based upon Wisdom? It is anticipated that to be in harmony with having belief in the Creator, that His\nWisdom is necessarily is linked to His Knowledge, His Will and to all of His Attributes. The question, therefore, would you think the One who creates does so for a purpose or He creates to leave the creation aimless? The person who believes the Creator is Perfect, would agree that His creating is not aimless. If so, then Who else other than Allaah has stated this? And\nyou know where? It is in His Final Revelation to man. Contemplate what He has said: ""Did you think that We have created you in play without any purpose and that you\nwill not be brought back to us, so exalted be Allaah the true king none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the\nSupreme Throne” [Quran 23: 115-116]. Does man think that he will be left aimless (without purpose)? [Quran, 75:36].\nSo Allaah is the One whom you believe to be ""the Creator."" He chose this title for Himself and He stated that He is the Only\nCreator, and that He Creates with Wisdom: Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no god but He: Then\nhow ye are deluded away from the Truth! [Qur'an, 40:62].\nSo this creation which Allaah creates must have a code organizing its existence and its aims. \nHence: 1- Allaah creates and His creating is all Wise and for a purpose.\n2- Allaah did not leave us aimless. He set a code to live accordingly. So He legislates, commands, and prohibits,\nand justly sets reward and accountability, because He is all-\nJust.\n3- In all aspects of this code, the manifestations of His Names and Attributes become known, contemplated and realized. Being\nthe Creator necessitates creating as well as purpose, guidance and legislations. Whoever ascribes is rewarded, since He is the Most Generous. When one commits a sin,he realizes that his Creator accepts repentance and is oft-Forgiving. So the manifestations of Allaah's Names and Attributes become\nrealized on earth and this is beloved to Allaah, the Creator.\n4- Allaah gives man life, physical sustenance, and spiritual\nguidance through the revelation which He entrusted His Messengers with [like Jesus the son of Mary, Moses and Muhammed]. He guides man to know how to benefit\nfrom the provisions, what is good for him and what is harmful. He raises in honor those who submitted to Him,\nand justly puts in humiliation those who disdain and are arrogant. He Forgives and is Merciful; He punishes and rewards in order that man shapes his life with the code that is all beneficial to man and which makes his life on this earth upright. And it cannot be upright unless man ascribes to the guidance sent to him by His\ncreator.\n5- If all mankind come to ascribe to his code (i.e. worship) Allaah on one heart, then this does not oblige any change in Allaah's Essence nor in His Attributes. If all the creation is on one heart, this does not increase in the dominion of Allaah anything.\nThat is"

"1","People have been saying to me ""But what if you are wrong what if god does exist?"" well here is the answer.","If I am wrong and god does exist (which is unlikely) I can look him in the eyes and say I have tried to examine and understand the universe the best I could and I couldn't see you in it."" But now what if I'm right there is no supreme being for us to be afraid of offending no one can be accused of playing god because he doesn't exist so science is free to advance without hindrance and that will expanded our knowledge of the universe and save billions of lives as we develop new effective cures for diseases and improve billions of others as new technology is developed .  Also there wouldn't be as much discrimination or war as religion is the main cause of that.  Oh what a wonderful world it would be.  So there you go that is what happens if I am wrong and what happens if I'm right and personally I think it's worth the gamble (not much of a gamble as there is no evidence to suggest god does exist so that would mean I am right just the sooner you theists admit it the better for everyone).","Dude I totally agree with you plus how do we know the bible is true like seriously there is no proof to what they say in the bible it could all be a lie"

You don't need to wait for blood work to report the suspicion. Explain to the police there is obvious animosity between this family and his EX..duh that's why they are EX's. Secondly, remind the police that if the family member is not being injured for malicious reasons there is a psychological disorder called Munchhausen Syndrome By Proxy where someone will injure others to get attention for themselves...IE ex wife visits, family member gets sick..EX gets help, she gets attention from doctors and nurses asking what happened...  This is not a common disorder but it exists and does happen... I'm more betting if she is doing something it's malicious."
"2","how cooperation between humoral and cellular immunity occure?","","Humoral immunity cannot happen without cellular immunity.\n\nHumoral immunity is provided by B-lymphocytes, which produce antibodies.  In order for B-lymphs to become active in producing antibodies, they need to be presented with an antigen.  Monocytes are components of cellular immunity.  Monos encounter a foreign body, say a bacteria.  They recognize it as foreign through the bacteria's antigens and ingest it by phagocytosis.  Once the bacteria has been eaten by the monocyte, it is digested and the antigens on it's surface are transported to the surface of the monocyte.  The monocyte then goes and finds a B-lymph and ""shows"" it the antigen.  The B-lymphs then start making antibodies to that antigen.  Monocytes are known as Antigen Presenting Cells because of this action.\n\nI hope this answers your question."

While I have been raised Christian I can most identify with the latter of the three, but all gays and lesbians have encountered issues with these religions because they are all Abrahamic and therefor take many similar opions on the subject with one another.\n\nThe one religion I was brought up-Christian-is becoming more gay friendly in these devisive times.  While Catholocism has taken a strong stance against homosexuality-it still has followers who are organised to fight for gay rights within its church.  The American Episcopal Church of course has appointed a gay bishop in Massachussets which makes a bold statement on how that denomination is prepared to include gays and lesbians.  Also the Prespyterian Church has recently voted to allow gays and lesbians to be ministers and lay-people at the local level  (See link below).\n\nAs for personal experience, I have to admit I am feeling less Christian as I experience more rejection and hatred from Christian communities.  While there is progress being made, I find that while most churches are teaching inclusion-it is under the pretense that being homosexual is still wrong and that gays and lesbians should be accepted out of pity with the expectations that they should repent for their sexuality.  I disagree with this as gays and lesbians should be accepted into a Christian community free of the supposed guilt and stigma attached to their sexuality.\n\nThere are pro-gay Christian oranisations operating-though I have never attended their services.

"3","is it possible to get herpes in your eyes?","","Herpes simplex is a very common virus affecting the skin, mucous membranes, nervous system, and the eye.  There are two types of herpes simplex.  Type I causes cold sores or fever blisters and may involve the eye.  Type II is sexually transmitted and rarely causes ocular problems.   \n\nNearly everyone is exposed to the virus during childhood.  Herpes simplex is transmitted through bodily fluids, and children are often infected by the saliva of an adult.  The initial infection is usually mild, causing only a sore throat or mouth.  After exposure, herpes simplex usually lies dormant in the nerve that supplies the eye and skin.  \n\nLater on, the virus may be reactivated by stress, heat, running a fever, sunlight, hormonal changes, trauma, or certain medications.  It is more likely to recur in people who have diseases that suppress their immune system.  In some cases, the recurrence is triggered repeatedly and becomes a chronic problem.  \n\nWhen the eye is involved, herpes simplex typically affects the eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea.  Keratitis (swelling caused by the infection), a problem affecting the cornea, is often the first ocular sign of the disease.  In some cases, the infection extends to the middle layers of the cornea, increasing the possibility of permanent scarring.  Some patients develop uveitis, an inflammatory condition that affects other eye tissues.\n\nIllustration by Mark Erickson\n \nSigns and Symptoms\n\nPain \n\nRed eye \n\nTearing \n\nLight sensitivity \n\nIrritation, scratchiness \n\nDecreased vision (dependent on the location and extent of the infection) \n\n \nDetection and Diagnosis\n\nHerpes simplex is diagnosed with a slit lamp examination.  Tinted eye drops that highlight the affected areas of the cornea may be instilled to help the doctor evaluate the extent of the infection.  \n\n \nTreatment\n\nTreatment of herpes simplex keratitis depends on the severity.  An initial outbreak is typically treated with topical and sometimes oral anti-viral medication.  The doctor may gently scrape the affected area of the cornea to remove the diseased cells.  Patients who experience permanent corneal scarring as a result of severe and recurrent infections may require a corneal transplant to restore their vision"

"2","Can we transform one cell into another?","","most adult cells in your body have undergone a process call differentiation which means they have specialized their structure into a specific cell function such as blood, bone, muscle, stomach lining etc. Most adult cells after differentiation cannot transform into another cell of a different type. Current research focuses on stem cells which are usually most abundant in embryos which have yet to fully differentiate and has the potential to form into any cells at all. Stem cell research are trying to use this property by converting adult cells back into their intial stem cell state but have not fully suceeded in such an attempt as of yet."

If there are light sources in your room (or outside your room that are visible through the curtains), it will mess with your body's internal clock.  Eliminate all internal light sources and get thick curtains that block all external light.\n\nAlso, don't use your computer at night.  The brightness from the monitor will wreak havoc on your body clock (your body will think that it is daytime and work to keep you awake longer).\n\nIf you can't sleep, read a book or, better yet, listen to music or audio books with your eyes closed.\n\nBest of luck!"

It can take some time to get pregnant after stopping the pills. It would be worth it to go anyway to get a good physical before you get pregnat to make sure everything it ok. \n\nYou said that you had no one to go with you to the doctor. Do you mean to drive you there? Or for communication needs? If is because of communication, you have the right to have an interpreter (at least in the US). Your doctor will need to provide one for you, you just have to request one. If you have asked before and they won't do it, then they may need some help understanding ADA law.

"1","Can you be an agnostic-christian?  Or is that just ""riding the fence""?","","Pascal seems to think so.  He set up this argument that it is better to live as a Christian than not to, just in case Christianity is true.  Well, to choose to live according to Christianity on that basis clearly indicates that one is an agnostic in reality.  But Pascal said that actions create belief, so that if you act like a Christian, before you know it, voila, you will believe in it!\n\nOf course, the major difficulty with Pascal's wager as I see it, is that he failed to factor in other religions.  What if Islam is right?  Then you've gambled on the wrong religion.\n\nBut anyhow, I DO believe that you can be an Agnostic Christian, an Agnostic Hindu, an Agnostic almost anything.  Because you are being very honest.  You are admitting that ultimately, no one knows.  And yet you still have your inclinations.  You are justified to follow the religion that you are inclined to most believe in, whether or not you are able to believe 100% in it or not.\n\nMost Christians have doubts, and some admit this.  There is not so much difference between a Christian with doubts and an ""agnostic-Christian"" perhaps."

MY mom and dad says taht as longs as I have a religion it's ok, as I'm an adult and old enough to do what I want.  So explain to me what are the pros and cons of juedaism.","I am Catholic so I will provide you the con of the action.\n\nYou have been baptised into the community of Jesus Christ in the Catholic Church. You have received Christ's Body and Blood at Mass.\n\nJudaism is a fine religion and I respect those who are Jewish. However, they were born and raised Jewish. You, on the other hand, at one point believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and received His flesh into your body.\n\nA religion is not a hobby. It is not a club to belong to. You cannot choose what you think you like the best. Judaism does not agree with this any more than Christianity does.\n\nYou act like you are buying a car and looking for the biggest bang for you buck and don't want to buy a lemon. This is not how God works whether you are Jewish or Christian. If I were you I would rethink just what each religion says their religion is. Because both do not say it is something you can just whimsically choose based upon a list of positives and negatives.\n\nI have the feeling that you don't go to Mass very often. If that is the case then it is obvious why you are leaving the Church. Would I also be correct in saying that you have not read an encyclical or even the writings of any of the Doctors of the Church? What about just reading a modern day apologist like Scott Hahn? Have you really thought this through and truly think you understand Catholicism and find it unappealing? I believe you may be Catholic, but have a misperception of your faith. Your parents have not taught you what Catholicism believes because Catholicism does not believe that as long as you have religion it is ok. It flies in the face of what Christ and the Catholic Church say about religion.\n\nI would strongly suggest that before you leave a faith that you have accepted (remember from Baptism the Holy Spirit is in you) you should come to understand just what you are leaving. Because it is no little thing to convert from the Catholic Church. If you had once believed in Christ then you are sinning by leaving your faith in Him."

And stories are made to enable one to pray with devotion even  when he/she is ignorent of his/her own inner strength to overcome the hurdles. \n\n'Gana' is the group of deferrent thoughts within the mind. 'Isha' is the master. 'Ganesh' is the master all thoughts and 'Indriyas'.

AA men dating caucasian women is a male ""look at me, I'm dating a white girl, are'nt I a stud"" kind of thing.

"1","how and why do you celebrate cinco de mayo?","","The 5th of May is not Mexican Independence Day, but it should be!  And Cinco de Mayo is not an American holiday, but it should be.  Mexico declared its independence from mother Spain on midnight, the 15th of September, 1810.  And it took 11 years before the first Spanish soldiers were told and forced to leave Mexico. \n\nSo, why Cinco de Mayo?  And why should Americans savor this day as well?  Because 4,000 Mexican soldiers smashed the French and traitor Mexican army of 8,000 at Puebla, Mexico, 100 miles east of Mexico City on the morning of May 5, 1862. \n\nThe French had landed in Mexico (along with Spanish and English troops) five months earlier on the pretext of collecting Mexican debts from the newly elected government of democratic President (and Indian) Benito Juarez.  The English and Spanish quickly made deals and left.  The French, however, had different ideas. \n\nUnder Emperor Napoleon III, who detested the United States, the French came to stay.  They brought a Hapsburg prince with them to rule the new Mexican empire.  His name was Maximilian; his wife, Carolota.  Napoleon's French Army had not been defeated in 50 years, and it invaded Mexico with the finest modern equipment and with a newly reconstituted Foreign Legion.  The French were not afraid of anyone, especially since the United States was embroiled in its own Civil War. \n\nThe French Army left the port of Vera Cruz to attack Mexico City to the west, as the French assumed that the Mexicans would give up should their capital fall to the enemy -- as European countries traditionally did. \n\nUnder the command of Texas-born General Zaragosa, (and the cavalry under the command of Colonel Porfirio Diaz, later to be Mexico's president and dictator), the Mexicans awaited.  Brightly dressed French Dragoons led the enemy columns.  The Mexican Army was less stylish. \n\nGeneral Zaragosa ordered Colonel Diaz to take his cavalry, the best in the world, out to the French flanks.  In response, the French did a most stupid thing; they sent their cavalry off to chase Diaz and his men, who proceeded to butcher them.  The remaining French infantrymen charged the Mexican defenders through sloppy mud from a thunderstorm and through hundreds of head of stampeding cattle stirred up by Indians armed only with machetes. \n\nWhen the battle was over, many French were killed or wounded and their cavalry was being chased by Diaz' superb horsemen miles away.  The Mexicans had won a great victory that kept Napoleon III from supplying the confederate rebels for another year, allowing the United States to build the greatest army the world had ever seen.  This grand army smashed the Confederates at Gettysburg just 14 months after the battle of Puebla, essentially ending the Civil War. \n\nUnion forces were then rushed to the Texas/Mexican border under General Phil Sheridan, who made sure that the Mexicans got all the weapons and ammunition they needed to expel the French.  American soldiers were discharged with their uniforms and rifles if they promised to join the Mexican Army to fight the French.  The American Legion of Honor marched in the Victory Parade in Mexico, City. \n\nIt might be a historical stretch to credit the survival of the United States to those brave 4,000 Mexicans who faced an army twice as large in 1862.  But who knows? \n\nIn gratitude, thousands of Mexicans crossed the border after Pearl Harbor to join the U.S. Armed Forces.  As recently as the Persian Gulf War, Mexicans flooded American consulates with phone calls, trying to join up and fight another war for America. \n\nMexicans, you see, never forget who their friends are, and neither do Americans.  That's why Cinco de Mayo is such a party -- A party that celebrates freedom and liberty.  There are two ideals which Mexicans and Americans have fought shoulder to shoulder to protect, ever since the 5th of May, 1862.  VIVA! el CINCO DE MAYO!!"

"2","how can you improve the quality of your RNA preparation?","","Rules of extraction of  RNA in the laboratory:\n\n1. Keep away any source of cells - dead or alive (well other than the tissue or cells from which you want to prepare RNA)! So keep your bench clean, use gloved hands etc. Use sterile solutions. If possible, use 'baked' containers.\n\n2. Use RNAse degrading reagents (e.g., RNAse away and/or DEPC -see Sigma catalogue; ambion is a company specialized in RNA-related products, you can try their catalogue/website too) in your solutions.\n\n3. Use RNAse free disposable labwares (like tips and tubes) as much as possible.\n\nABOVE steps should take care of the notorius RNAse enzyme that is present in most of the cells and hard to be inactivated.\n\n4. Use 'RNAse-free DNAse' wherever possible. This avoids DNA contamination.\n\n5. Extend your precautions to the gel electrophoretic analysis and storage of prepared RNA also!\n\nRest: Stick to your protocol"

Leonard Digges is sometimes credited with the invention in England in the 1570s, but usually credit for assembling the first telescope is given to an unknown Dutch spectacle maker in about 1608. Some name that person as Hans Lippershey (c. 1570 – c. 1619), but Jacob Metius and Zacharias Jansen also claimed to have invented a telescope during the same period. Even if Lippershey did not make the first one, he publicized it. Galileo Galilei made his own telescope in 1609, calling it at first a ""perspicillum,"" and then using the terms ""telescopium"" in Latin and ""telescopio"" in Italian (from which the English word derives). Galileo is generally credited with being the first to use a telescope for astronomical purposes"""
"1","do filipinos speak english very well?","","I am proud to say that most of us speak very good English compared to our other Asian counterparts.  Our medium of instruction in our schools is English.  We boast of our quality schools (not to mention the cheap fees) so that a lot of foreign students come here to pursue their studies.\n\nBut, similarly in other countries, we, too, have a share of those who don't speak English well.  We cannot even rule out that a number of Americans or British speak grammatically incorrect English (even incorrect spelling of words when these are written).  They may have the advantage of speaking it fast than us Filipinos but I am sure we do not lag behind when it comes to speaking and writing them in correct grammar and spelling.  And it was a FILIPINA who won an extemporaneous speech held in London some two years back (I just couldnt remember anymore her name)!!\n\nIt is the Philippine culture to value education very highly.  Filipino parents strive hard to provide education for their children.  Come to the Philippines and every little child of school age understands, comprehends and converses English when u talk to them .  There are even countries whose people don't even understand a word of English, thereby needing you to exert much effort with hand signals, lol.\n\nWe are proud to be Filipinos!"

"2","What is a double-blind clinical study?","","Double-blind means that both the researcher and the subject are 'blinded' as to which group the subject is in.\n\nFor instance, if you are testing a drug for blood pressure, you might give patients in one group the standard drug, and patients in another group the new drug. You would make the capsules for each drug look and taste identical, and label the bottles 'A' and 'B', without either the people taking the drugs, or the people taking the blood pressure measurements, knowing who was getting which drug.\n\nThis is to avoid bias. If a researcher knows a subject is getting a certain treatment (whether it's medical, musical, whatever!), they might consciously or unconsciously bias the results to reflect their belief about the efficacy of the treatment. Double-blinding is now the accepted standard for clinical trials.\n\nRandomization into treatment groups is another important factor, again to try and eliminate bias or confounding factors that might mean you get a positive result for a reason OTHER than that the treatment actually works."

This is a sexual activity and thus yes, it can be called sex. Granted it is not sexual intercourse but it is a sexual act in some form. \nThe word ""virginity"" has a strong image of ""abstinence."" You may decide you had sex too soon or rethink your decision to be sexually active. Becoming a second-generation virgin is one way to strongly state to others and to yourself that you have decided to abstain from sex. \n\nRegain a feeling of control - For some, virginity is a state of mind. The origin of the word ""virgin"" is from the Greek word ""Virgo,"" often associated with goddesses of power. For some, second-generation virginity is a reclaiming of power and control over one's body. \n\nReclaiming your sexuality - When someone forces or pressures you to have sex, or makes you feel your virginity was ""stolen,"" it doesn't feel like that should be your ""first time."" Your first time having sex is special, and no one has the right to take that from you."

This form only exists at higher temperatures.  When a liquid at -214 to -183oC it exists as a di-radical.  There is a single bond between each oxygen, and each oxygen holds a single electron in its p-orbital.

"3","what are cause of bird flu infection?","","Avian influenza is an infection caused by avian (bird) influenza (flu) viruses. These influenza viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them.\n\nInfected birds shed influenza virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Susceptible birds become infected when they have contact with contaminated secretions or excretions or with surfaces that are contaminated with secretions or excretions from infected birds. Domesticated birds may become infected with avian influenza virus through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry, or through contact with surfaces (such as dirt or cages) or materials (such as water or feed) that have been contaminated with the virus.\n\nInfection with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry causes two main forms of disease that are distinguished by low and high extremes of virulence. The “low pathogenic” form may go undetected and usually causes only mild symptoms (such as ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production). However, the highly pathogenic form spreads more rapidly through flocks of poultry. This form may cause disease that affects multiple internal organs and has a mortality rate that can reach 90-100% often within 48 hours.\nHuman infection with avian influenza viruses\n\nThere are many different subtypes of type A influenza viruses. These subtypes differ because of changes in certain proteins on the surface of the influenza A virus (hemagglutinin [HA] and neuraminidase [NA] proteins). There are 16 known HA subtypes and 9 known NA subtypes of influenza A viruses. Many different combinations of HA and NA proteins are possible. Each combination represents a different subtype. All known subtypes of influenza A viruses can be found in birds.\n\nUsually, “avian influenza virus” refers to influenza A viruses found chiefly in birds, but infections with these viruses can occur in humans. The risk from avian influenza is generally low to most people, because the viruses do not usually infect humans. However, confirmed cases of human infection from several subtypes of avian influenza infection have been reported since 1997. Most cases of avian influenza infection in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry (e.g., domesticated chicken, ducks, and turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with secretion/excretions from infected birds. The spread of avian influenza viruses from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely, and transmission has not been observed to continue beyond one person.\n\n“Human influenza virus” usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. There are only three known A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) currently circulating among humans. It is likely that some genetic parts of current human influenza A viruses came from birds originally. Influenza A viruses are constantly changing, and they might adapt over time to infect and spread among humans.\n\nDuring an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry, there is a possible risk to people who have contact with infected birds or surfaces that have been contaminated with secretions or excretions from infected birds.\n\nSymptoms of avian influenza in humans have ranged from typical human influenza-like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress), and other severe and life-threatening complications. The symptoms of avian influenza may depend on which virus caused the infection."

"2","Help finding the following arithmetic sequence ...plz =)?","Find the arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference not equal to 0, whose second, tenth & thirty-fourth terms are the first 3 terms in a geometric sequence.","OK, let's see.\n\nIt's an arithmetic sequence, so the difference between consecutive terms is a constant.  The first term is 1, so we can express each term as:\n\nx(i) = 1 + k*(i-1), i = 1, 2, 3, ....\n\nNext the problem says that the 2nd, 10th, and 34th terms are the first three terms in a geometric sequence.  That means that the ratio of the 10th term to the 2nd term must be the same as the ratio of the 34th term to the 10th, because when you divide any two terms of a geometric sequence, you get the same constant.\n\ni(2) = 1 + 1*k\ni(10) = 1 + 9*k\ni(34) = 1 + 33*k\n\nSo we said i(10)/i(2) must equal i(34)/i(10):\n\n1+9k    1+33k\n-------- = --------\n1+1k      1+9k\n\nCross multiplying: (1+9k)^2 = (1+1k)(1+33k).\n\nThen 1 + 18k + 81k^2 = 1 + 34k + 33k^2.\n\nPutting it all on the left side, 48k^2 - 16k = 0, or 16k(3k - 1) = 0.\n\nSo either k = 0 (not interesting) or k = 1/3.\n\nTherefore the arithmetic sequence must be:\n\n1, 1 1/3, 1 2/3, 2, 2 1/3, 2 2/3, 3, 3 1/3, ....\n\nThe second term is 1 1/3.  The 10th term is 4 (1 + 3 * 1/3).  The 34th term is 12 (1 + 33 * 1/3).  So the geometric progression would be:\n\n4/3, 4, 12, 48, 192, ....."

I think that's what I would do, especially with them being so young. I would tell him he can not have his kids until he gets some serious help. Have the kids stay at other relatives homes until he gets his act together. This is dangerous. I read of a guy who ran a drug lab in his house and he also had kids.

Equations of lines in 3-space are VECTOR equations with a simple form (kind of like slope and intercept): we need a point the line passes through -- (2,-1,0) -- and a direction to go -- parallel to the x-axis.

Depending on the neighbor, it might be best to do this secretly; or it might actually be best to let your neighbor see what’s going down.\n\nMeanwhile, check with local law officials or city to see if there's a barking/noise ordinance where you live.  You might also visit http://www.municode.com/resources/online%20Library.asp to see if there’s one.  If there is, call the police or animal control.  Animal control might tell you it’s up to the police to issue citations; the police might tell you animal control handles it.  Or an officer might tell you he has to witness it as it occurs, and the dog decides to take a ten-minute breather during his visit.  You might be told it’s a civil matter; (if there is an ordinance, it is a criminal matter).  Police sometimes won't do their jobs, so you might have to put an officer on camera while the dog’s barking and ask why a citation isn’t being issued.  This _will_ anger the officer, but your neighbor will certainly get the citation.  It will go to court, and you will probably be subpoenaed to testify.  Provide copies of the log and video tape to the city attorney and/or police; bring the originals with you to court.\n\nIf live in an area where there isn’t an ordinance, then it’s a civil matter.  You could take him to small claims, or talk it over with your attorney to see if you’re due a larger settlement (probably not).\n\nUnderstand if the neighbor doesn’t voluntarily curb the dog's barking and gets questioned by police, taken to court, fined, and so on, he’s going to be angry and may retaliate.  Be prepared in the event that he does.\n\nSo sorry to hear of another person going through this.  Best of luck."

I find myself asking is it worth it to be made fun of by even my sisters and brothers? I personally just wanna wait til i find someone I'm ready to give that to. I'm not a prude and I'm not waiting for marriage, just someone special. But its hard even my 14 year old niece has had sex before! I'm not saying that women who have chosen to have sex already are in any way less than I am. Everytime I see questions like this people seem to be applauding the virgin who asked the question. I do't want applause I just would like some advice on how to stick to my guns, because with all the peer pressure I just feel like I should, even though I'm not ready.","You have already answered your own questions.  You are the only one that can tell you to have sex.  Good for you for not wanting to just have sex to ""get it over with.""  \n\nYour friends (and even your family members ...

Stupid to fool around so irresponsibly.\n\nThe bottom line is, you need to tell your critics (because they're not peers or friends when they're telling you to do something stupid that you KNOW is stupid and you don't want to do) that its your body and your choice and they need to mind their own business.  \n\nThere is NOTHING wrong with waiting to have sex...and you're doing it for the right reasons.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are a common side effect of antibiotics, but this is not good.\n\nNumber 3, strep is a real pain to get rid of, and your particular strain would seem to be a bit resistant to amoxicillin.

This molecule carries the energy to the respiratory chain system, where three ATP molecules are energized from each one."
"3","What causes appendicitis?","","What is appendicitis?\nAppendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. It is thought that appendicitisbegins when the opening from the appendix into the cecum becomes blocked. Theblockage may be due to a build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The mucus or stool hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening. This rock is called a fecalith (literally, arock of stool). At other times, the lymphatic tissue in the appendix may swell and block the appendix. Bacteria which normally are found within the appendixthen begin to invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to theinvasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation.(An alternative theory for the cause of appendicitis is an initial rupture ofthe appendix followed by spread of bacteria outside the appendix.. The cause ofsuch a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in thelymphatic tissue that line the wall of the appendix.)"

"2","Which one reacts rapidly with nucleophiles - alkenes or alkynes and why?","","You are not breaking a double bond or a triple bond, you are breaking a pi-bond in both addition to alkenes and alkynes.\nThe rate of reaction with a nucleophile depends a lot on which nucleophile and which alkene or alkyne. The product of a nucleophilic addition produces a carbocation attached by a single bond in the case of alkenes, and by a double bond in the case of alkynes. The vinyl cation from addition to alkynes is much higher in energy than the alkane cation from addition to the corresponding alkene, so in that sense, addition would seem to be slower to an alkyne. However, there is evidence to suggest some sort of cyclic addition in the case of alkynes, which complicates the picture. Add to that the effect of solvent and other reaction conditions, and it should be clear that there is no simple answer to your question."

Have a little chocolate or, better yet all three! If you're having sex just to get an orgasm, it won't come. A little trick I've learned... when he's on top of you, move your hips up and in towards him so he's totally inside you. Keep moving your hips wherever feels best, play with your clit while your at it, stare at his body and into his eyes and keep telling yourself how sexy he is and how much you want him. Use a vibrator while your at it. If all else fails, get a book to better educate yourself or even call a sex therapist. Life is too short to have limited O's."

Matt 5:43-44?","Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.1 Peter 5:8\n\nSo, we must love the devil?\n\nWhy can't god just make peace with the devil?\n\nWhy preach love and forgiveness when you yourself cannot live up to the standards you set.\n\nJesus said be perfect, like God is perfect.\n\nGod can't forgive his own enemy but wants us to forgive our enemy.\n\n\nWhat is up with this religion?","Jesus Christ said: “You heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.”—Matthew 5:43, 44.\n\nIt was the oral tradition of the Jews that held that ‘hating an enemy’ was the right thing to do. Jesus, however, said we must love our enemy, not just our friend. This is difficult but not impossible. Loving an enemy does not mean liking all his ways or his deeds. The Greek word found in Matthew’s account is derived from a·ga′pe, which describes a love that acts in harmony with principle. The person who manifests a·ga′pe, principled love, does good even to an enemy who hates and mistreats him. Why? Because it is the way to imitate Christ, and it is the way to conquer hatred. One Greek scholar noted: “[A·ga′pe] enables us to conquer our natural tendency to anger and to bitterness.” \n\nThe Christian, by contrast, is under obligation to love his enemies, that is, those who make themselves personal enemies. Such love (Gr., a·ga′pe) is not sentimentality, based on mere personal attachment, as is usually thought of, but is a moral or social love based on deliberate assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty, and propriety, sincerely seeking the other’s good according to what is right. A·ga′pe (love) transcends personal enmities, never allowing these to cause one to abandon right principles and to retaliate in kind. As to those who oppose his Christian course and persecute him, doing so in ignorance, the servant of God will even pray for such that their eyes might be opened to see the truth concerning God and His purposes.—Mt 5:44."

I love everything about him, humor, sensitivity, brawn, everything he's a perfect match for me & I feel I'm the same for him.  I recently expressed how my feelings have grown & I'd like to be in a sexual/intimate & monogomous relationship with him...he has pushed me away yet has expressed that he feels the same. So the issue: He is HIV+ and I am HIV-.  He is afraid, I am not, I believe in romance, love, etc & feel that this is the man I want to take a chance & spend my life with. I know we can have a healthy safe relationship regardless of our different status. I know he feels for me.  Should I just stay friends, say goodbye or show him I'm there for the long haul good or bad and how?","Wow, Heavy!! You sound very wise for a 25 yr old. Ooops a stereotype. Sorry. Well, I have to agree on this-do not even worry about the age difference, it is not the issue and that will certainly pass if it is.  \n\nI commend you on your ability to wanting to stay through the ""long haul"", just be sure you have the strength for it.  I have a feeling this guy really cares for you and is probably having a difficult time right now depending on how long he has been HIV+. It is great that he cares for you and your health, but in my opinion one should never miss the opportunity to have a real love in their life in spite of an illness, disease, race or the rejection of society because of male/male or female/female.  To live a life in fear is a life half lived. Ask yourself how strong you really feel this bond is between you and stick with it.\n\nHelp him through his fears. Do not be afraid to make the HIV the center issue, because he will soon realize that you are truly there for him and vice vesa. Find information for him on HIV+ and HIV- couples from health advisors, clinics or the internet. Uunderstand that you can maintain a healthy safe, free from infection sexual and loving relationship.  You are his friend too, so don't give up on him.  Educate yourself and him everything will fall into place the more educated you both are.\n\nI know many long lasting HIV+ and HIV - couples, strght and gay.

I think your guy friend does not have all the resources to him or has not looked into them.

"2","why drill pipe always get magnetised after getting out from downhole?","","It has to do with the alignment of charge due to unidirectional striking force- The same thing will happen to any iron bar after a hard strike-the force generated causes (usually temporary) alignment of enough atoms to generate magnetism. In a normal bar of iron, the atoms are aligned more or less at random, so there is no cumulative directional magnetic force- Any time a significantly large proportion of atoms are aligned together, the summation of the electromagnetic charges can be detected.  Rotating a piece of metal will not induce magnetic charge.  Exposing iron to an extremely powerful magnetic field will, because it will cause alignment of the atoms in the iron, but the magnetic field of the Earth (inside, outside, everywhere) is extremely weak."

Eat only meat, eggs, apples and maybe fruits such as avocado which are high in protein. Now on this diet attempt the following exercise routine.\n\nGo to the gym once every two or three days (every day is best) and start off using fairly heavy weights. Throughout your routine, make the weights heavier and heavier and don't forget to use the negative energy (i.e. if you are lifting weights, strain on the way up and way down).\n\nDo this 'til you can do nothing more. Do not drink any water during this time and wait until about half an hour after your workout before drinking. This will maximise the lactic acid in your muscles and providing you are eating enough you will get ripped in no time!\n\nIt will hurt a lot for the first week, but stick with it. If it still hurts after that, take it a bit easier. You must sleep a lot for recovery.\n\nHope it works out for you!"

"2","what is the partial pressure of oxygen in blood? & what maintains this pressure?","","Oxygen Transport\nIn the lungs, oxygen diffuses from alveolar air into the blood because the venous blood has a lower partial pressure. The oxygen dissolves in the blood. Only a small amount is carried as a physical solution (0.31 ml per 100 ml). The remainder of the oxygen is carried in chemical combination with the hemoglobin in red blood cells (erthrocytes).\n\nfrom http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/260acidbasebal.html\n\n\nNormal analysis results\nNormal blood gas values are as follows:\n partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): 75-100 mm Hg \n\n\nfrom http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/blood_gas_analysis.jsp"
"2","WHAT IS EVOLUTION? what are some misconceptions of Darwins ideas.?","","http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat01.html#Q01\nBiological evolution refers to the cumulative changes that occur in a population over time. These changes are produced at the genetic level as organisms' genes mutate and/or recombine in different ways during reproduction and are passed on to future generations. Sometimes, individuals inherit new characteristics that give them a survival and reproductive advantage in their local environments; these characteristics tend to increase in frequency in the population, while those that are disadvantageous decrease in frequency. This process of differential survival and reproduction is known as natural selection.\n\nMisconception 1:  According to the theory of natural evolution, experts are hard pressed to explain why homo sapiens walked erect.  One theory was that because the forest died and the area was covered with tall grass, homo sapiens have got to stand upright in order to see danger ahead.  Problem was why other apes were able to withdraw to the remaining forests and survived to these days?  Early human stood at an ungainly upright manner losing it dexterity whilst other apes are happily swinging through the trees.\n\nMisconception 2:  Early apes were largely vegetarians.  These are healthy food and easily available and the guts were built for digesting them.  Why change to an unhealthy and difficult to get diet of meats?  On top of that, their guts weren’t built for them.  \n\nMisconception 3:  Early apes have a coat of fur.  This is a wonderful covering, it kept the body warm in cold weather and well ventilated in warm weather.  In the wild, it is self-cleaning.  Why the specie of apes called homo sapiens chose to go naked?  He now has to invent clothing and air conditioner.\n\nMisconception 4:  Tongues are for talking, why other apes and animals don’t need to talk?  In fact, homo sapiens invented speeches.  Look at the multitude of languages and misunderstanding as a result. These lead to endless wars."

"3","Any cure for adrenaline problems?","Do you know any herbs or medicines that relieves people suffering from overly producing adrenaline on their body?\n\nI am not talking about using the anti-depressents like the SSRI or MAOI, or any kind of meds using the brain chemicals to ""cover up"" the anxious feelings. \n\nI want to know if there is any herbs or meds that directly decrease or cure the overly producing adrenaline in the body.\n\nthank you.","There are medications called ""beta blockers"" that act against adrenaline.  There are many available out there; talk to your physician.\n\nThey work by blocking one kind of ""receptor"" that adrenaline molecules normally plug into.  When adrenaline plugs into these receptors, this is when you get the effects that you don't enjoy - racing heart, sweating, nausea, etc.\n\nSide effects are obviously the opposite of having too much adrenaline; they include sleepiness and hypotension (low blood pressure).  The key is for you and your physician to find the right dose, if you choose this method.\n\nAs far as herbal remedies are concerned, there are a few out there, but there is no way to control exactly how much of the herb (in terms of potency) that you're taking, and the herb might also contain other ingredients that could be detrimental to your health.\n\nOne of the herbal remedies that has enjoyed popularity recently is valerian root, available in powder/gelcap and tea form.  Most nutrition stores stock the gelcap, the tea form is much harder to find.  Some people find that only the tea form is effective.  Most people find valerian to be pretty safe, but too much can make you drowsy.\n\nPreliminary research has shown that the active ingredients in valerian act very similarly to some anti-epilepsy medications (such as Neurontin) and in slight similarity to the  ""benzodiazepines"" (such as Valium).  Again, remember that valerian, just like any pill your doctor prescribes you, is in fact a drug."

"2","How do I effectively stop heat from transferring between two bodies of matter?","For a school science project I need to be able to design and create a wetsuit.  However, I do not fully understand how a wetsuit works, or how it could be improved.","whoissarthak's idea works, but that isn't a wet suit; that's a dry suit.  A wet suit works differently.  The idea is that there are basically three ways to move heat: conduction, radiation, and convection.  Conduction is when two things are in direct contact, like touching a hot stove or a cold flagpole.  Radiation has to do with the infrared light emited by warm bodies, and has nothing much to do with your project.  Convection is the real concern--it is the transfer of heat by means of a fluid intermediate, and it is the fast form of heat loss.\n\nYou're body sheds heat by means of perspiration, where sweat evaporates and takes heat away with it--that's convection.  When you fell colder in a strong breexe, that's convection taking heat away quicker.  When you blow on a spoon of hot soup to cool it, that's convection.\n\nThe way a wetsuit works is by not allowing the water in contact with the skin to be carried away.  It inhibits the movement of water through it.  Enough gets in to contact the skin and make your skin wet, which is why they call it a wetsuit, but that water doesn't leave easily.  It stays put and your body heats up the water.  Hence, the water in your wetsuit is much warmer than the water in the surrounding ocean, so the water taking heat from your skin is not quickly carried away and replaced by more cold water.\n\nIf you want to make a wetsuit, you want something htat will make it difficult (but not impossible) for water to come and go."

"1","Why do ""people"" discriminate against blacks and puerto ricans?","","Ah, the age old question of discrimination.\n\nNow I know that you didn't think that you would be able to post such a question on Yahoo Answers and get a sincerely honest answer, did you?\n\nFor those of you who don't know or walk around with blinders on, racism still exists. A friend of mine and I were recently talking about racism. The irony of this is the fact that he is white, gay, republican and a reformed racist. (At my insistance, well at least that's what he tells me.) He had a very hard time being my friend because he was raised to believe that all black people were, well you know the n-word and all the negative connotations therein. He admitted it, yes he was raised that way by his father. The same man who abused and hurt him taught him to hate people of color. They moved way out into a rural area just to get away from minorities. Sad, but true. \n\nWell anyway, he told me that racism hasn't gone anywhere. (I kind of already knew that.) He said that it has just become no longer politically correct or socially acceptable to behave in a racist fashion in public. He told me that people still use the ""N-word"" when no one is around, and that the things that ""the man"" does to keep the black man down have become more sophisticated. This is true. Why is it that African American infants have the highest infant mortality rate in a modernized country? 9.3 infant deaths per 1,000 births. \n\nThe answer to why people discriminate against African Americans and Puerto Ricans is simple. Someone has to be at the bottom, in order for there to be a top. Eventually, money will be the factor that separates us. It will be the rich and the poor. But in the meantime it will be color, because as I have stated time and time again, people of color will never assimilate into the mainstream culture."

My dr wants me to get a\ntesticular sonogram and blood tests for testicular cancer..I am","Testicular Cancer\n\n==============\n\n\n\nYour doctor is wise to consider testicular cancer.  Although most\n\ncases present between the ages of 15-35, this type of cancer can occur\n\nat any age.  It's a relatively rare tumor (about 2-3 new cases per\n\n100,000 males per year in the US) [Smith's Urology].  Testicular\n\ncancer has a very high cure rate - even higher when diagnosed early. \n\nThe testicular ultrasound (aka sonogram), as stated below in\n\nCampbell's, is 95% sensitive and specific for testicular cancer and\n\ndoes not involve exposing you to ionizing radiation (like an X-ray). \n\nBasically it's a noninvasive low-risk test to detect a potential\n\ncancer that, if found, is highly curable - high yield, low risk.\n\n\n\nOne of the standard Urology texts (Campbell's) outlines the diagnostic\n\npathway for testicular cancer:\n\n\n\n""Unfortunately, delays in the timely and accurate diagnosis of\n\ntesticular cancer continue to be a significant problem. [123] Moul\n\n(1994) noted a mean duration of symptoms of 26 weeks before diagnosis\n\nin a review of 4948 testicular cancer patients. Both patient and\n\nphysician factors contribute to this delay in diagnosis. Painless\n\nscrotal masses are often ignored, whereas testicular cancers\n\npresenting with scrotal pain are treated as epididymitis up to 18% to\n\n30% of the time ([19] Bosl et al, 1981; [144] Prout et al, 1984).\n\nAlmost 20% of patients present with signs or symptoms of metastatic\n\ndisease such as back or abdominal pain, weight loss, neck mass,\n\ngynecomastia, or breast tenderness ([19] Bosl et al, 1981; Thornhill\n\net al, 1987; [15] Bosl et al, 2000). Patients have undergone\n\nunnecessary mastectomy or laparotomy or prolonged therapy for back\n\npain without a diagnosis of testicular cancer being considered ([143]\n\nPost and Belis, 1980; [125] Moul and Moellman, 1992; [124] 2000).\n\n\n\nA careful history and physical examination, as well as serum β–human\n\nchorionic gonadotropin (HCG), α-fetoprotein (AFP), and lactate\n\ndehydrogenase (LDH) testing, are helpful in establishing a correct\n\ndiagnosis. Scrotal sonography is extremely accurate in identifying\n\nsolid intratesticular lesions with greater than 95% sensitivity and\n\nspecificity.\n\n\n\nWalsh: Campbell's Urology, 8th ed., 2002. Elsevier. Pp. 2920-2921.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, one usually also looks at the serum HCG, AFP, and\n\nLDH as tumor markers.  I would trust an endocrinologist to pick the\n\nright tests and interpret them correctly.  They have special training\n\nin the physiology hormone levels and may be better than the GU surgeon\n\nat pin pointing the cause of these abnormalities, particularly if they\n\nare due to something outside of the genitourinary system (for example\n\nin the pituitary or other organ).  There isn't really a reason to see\n\na urologic oncologist (or genitourinary (GU)  surgeon) until you have\n\nthe results of the ultrasound, since the GU surgeon is unlikely to\n\noperate without a diagnosis or target for biopsy.  If you do\n\nultimately go to a GU surgeon, it's very helpful to have an ultrasound\n\nin hand on the first visit.  Otherwise, they will likely see you,\n\norder an ultrasound, then have to see you again when the results are\n\nback.  The endocrinologist is essentially saving you a wasted visit to\n\nthe GU doc before you have the right tests complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple types of testicular cancer, the most common being\n\nseminona (35%).  More than 50% of spermatocytic seminoma cases are\n\nfound in men over 50.

Nonvascular plants are bryophytes, the most primitive land-dwelling plantsm, and lack the adaptations to transport water and nutrients against gravity (lignin-impregnated conducting cells).\nVascular plants are, evolutionarily speaking, more recent, and contain xylem and phloem, the lignin-impregnated conducting cells which provide a rigid upright support structure and which transport water and nutrients throughout the plant. Xylem is the ""woody"" part of vascular plants, and transports sap up from the roots, while phloem transports nutrients throughout the plant."

Then again I wrote a (crappy) poem today:\n\nThis is not what I want to say\nThe words I need won't come\nI can't ask you to stay\nAnd abandon your place in the sun\n\nYou know that I'm falling\nAnd falling fast it's true\nIt's not the first time I've fallen\nFrom grace, from favour, for you\n\nNow I am reclaiming \nMy part in this thrice blighted day\nIt's myself I'm blaming\nBecause I can't ask you to stay\n- EKL 2006\n\nI have considered becoming a priest of some kind  - will this make me less hollow?\nAlso I thought I was over her but I still occasionally feel for her 8 years after I last saw her.  Is this normal?  Is there such a thing?","Gosh I feel bad for you...sounds like a hardcore case of depression.  It's so easy for other people to just tell you to seek therapy, isn't it?  I have lifelong bipolar disorder, so I know how it feels to have been down in the depths of depression...thankfully for me, I eventually snap out of it and go into ""happy"" mode.  In my experience, talking to a therapist has not helped.  They ask me a million questions, write them all down and make me feel like a science project, give me a prescription, and send me on my way -- all for $175 for a 30 minute appointment.  I have found that when there is a constant vague feeling of depression for seemingly no reason, it is because I have suppressed that reason.  Identify the sources of your unhappiness.  For me, I finally realized that it was about three different instances in my past that had changed my mindset or my innocence in some way -- made me jaded to the world.  I'm still working on it, but I'm hoping to confront and forgive or be forgiven by the people involved.  And yeah, I've had my heart broken and I still have feelings years later, so it's perfectly normal.  If you have self-esteem issues, work on something that you enjoy and that you are good at -- don't worry if you fail at first, practice makes perfect.  Help others or be a friend.  It's almost impossible to feel low about yourself if you know you are good at something or worth something to someone.  If your self-esteem is in the dumps because you are worried about what people think of you, then don't be.  Look at people who are stupid and unattractive and have confidence -- if they have it, then why shouldn't you?  Basically, you need to recognize meaning in your life.  It's already there, you just need to find it.  All right, enough Dr. Phil crap from me.  Good luck and bless you."

"2","my cat had radiation therapy..?","and we weren't supposed to hold him for too long because of the exposure to the radiation.  but when i woke up this morning, he was snuggled against my leg.  what should i do/take to counteract the effects of any radiation poisoning?\n\ni've seen potassium iodide listed as a treatment, but i can't find that in any of the stores.","It kind of depends on exactly what the radiation was given to treat; they tell you not to handle patients who get ""seeds"" implanted because while the material is in their bodies, some of the contamination may leach out through pores in their skin and contaminate you.  If your cat had a thyroid problem, then radioactive iodine 131 was used to kill thyroid tissue, because the thyroid selectively collects iodine.  As a previous poster said, by the time you can get to a doctor, you're already going to absorb all you're probably going to get from this exposure, because iodine 131 has a half life of about a half an hour, so by the time three hours have passed, it's all decayed away to normal iodine.  The reason you found potassion iodide listed as a treatment is that if you take a tablet, it floods your system with more iodine than your thyroid can handle, and it won't accept any more; assuming you take it BEFORE or IMMEDIATELY after your exposure to radioactive iodine, it prevents your body from absorbing the radioactive stuff and it just flushes right out of your system.  \n\nIf, however, your cat was treated with something other than iodine, whatever isotope was used may have other effects on you (strontium deposits in bone, for instance, replacing calcium)  Only way to know for sure is to figure out what the treatment was and ask your doctor for advice.  It is probably nothing to worry about, but worth checking with a medical professional just to be sure."

I believe this is a sign of thier own weaknesses.","Actually the Da Vinci code, though it is fiction, actually attacks traditional beliefs about Jesus. This has created a huge stir, much to Dan Brown's delight. It means his book will sell through the roof. The book is well written. Its message will go out throughout the world. That is, Dan Brown's message will go out throughout the world. I really don't know what all the excitement is about because a review of history will show the inaccuracies contained in his book.

No, the abbreviation is CA now, although before the Post Office got involved it was usually Cal.  Cali is slang."
"1","What makes religion so special?","Why is it considered rude to criticise religion as we do other beliefs (political, personal, etc.)? Some people become genuinely upset at the mere statement of ""there is no god."" Why do people tend to put themselves in harms way because of their religious beliefs? Why do people feel the need to hate or kill people who's religious beliefs are different from theirs. And most importantly why do people demand such ultimate respect for religion?\n\nReligious beliefs are tantamount to personal opinion... and as such should be open to criticism.","Because at its heart there is no way to justify it. If you made a statement you would normally expect to be able to justify it by appealing to evidence, the religious cannot."

This tradition goes back to saint Peter who, according to the [banned] gnostic scriptures indicate that he was against ""the woman"". Now just look at the mindset of those Roman Catholics who burned gnostics and their writings, and imagine that these are the ones who chose the books for the bible. Do you think they were honest?

Let's put religion out of the picture for just a second, okay. It is simple, you either believe Jesus died on the cross for you and God created you or you don't. You can say that only christians will enter into heaven but i believe no matter what religion you call yourself, if you believe in God and have accepted God as your savior then you can call yourself whatever you want and you will still go to heaven. People choose to worship God in many ways. But the key to the door is Have you confessed that you are a sinner? Do you believe Jesus died on the cross for you? Do you want to spent eternity in heaven or hell? I'd be too scared not to believe and to not be saved. What if all us ""crazy"" christians are right? What if we are wrong?

"2","probability: what are the chances of getting 2 heads???...tricky question-----?","Sergio said "" if I toss 2 coins, I can get 2 heads, or 2 tails, or a head and a tail.

Explain why.?\n\n\nI thouhgh the answer would be 1/3 but it isnt obviously, can anyone tell me the answer, but more importantly explain how they got this? Thanks very much.","When you are computing the probability of a given event such as 2 heads, 2 tails, or one of each, you are essentially counting the number of ways a given event can occur and dividing this number by the number of all possible outcomes.\n\nIf you toss 2 coins once ( or one coin twice) there are 4 possible outcomes:\n\nHH = both heads\nHT = 1st heads, 2nd tails\nTH = 1st tails, 2nd heads\nTT = both tails\n\nAssuming the coins are ""fair"" each outcome is equally likely.\n\nThere is one way in four that two heads (or 2 tails) can happen so the probability for each of these outcomes is 1/4\nBut there are two ways you can have one head and one tail and so the probability of this happening is 2/4 =1/2. The sum of all the probabilities of the distinct outcomes will always equal 1. \n1/4 +1/4 + 1/2 =1\n\nHow about if you have 3 tosses? The 8 possible outcomes are as follows:\n\nHHH \nHHT\nHTH\nTHH\nHTT\nTHT\nTTH\nTTT\nWe see there is only one way to have 3 heads (or 3 tails) and so the probability of 3 heads (or 3 tails) = 1/8\nHowever there are 3 ways you can have 2 heads and one tail, so the probability of this happening is 3/8. And there are also 3 ways you can have one head and 2 tails, so 3/8 is the probability for this too."

If you have no religious or moral obligations, I suggest you talk with your OB/Gyn about this. You should be in a monogamous relationship, and ideally have had at least one child. I have no children, but I persuaded my doctor to let me have one anyway. It does hurt when they put it in, and you have cramping for about 24 hours. Then it's great.

It is only a MAYA (Illusion) and makes people addicted to that without any intoxication even. Only regular smokers feel stressed with out smoking. They also feel depressed when they try to stop smoking. \n\nTobacco smoke contains nicotine, an addictive stimulant which temporarily improves alertness and memory, but also forms a strong physical and psychological chemical dependence (addiction). Medical research has determined that smoking is a major contributing factor towards many health problems, particularly lung cancer (which has a survival percentage of 16.4%), emphysema, and cardiovascular disease.  Many countries regulate or restrict tobacco sales and advertising and require warnings be placed prominently on the product packaging. Many municipalities now ban smoking in a variety of public venues due to health impacts on non-smokers breathing second-hand smoke.\n\nSmoking leads to various cronic and uncurable disease like CANCER, Heart and Lung diseases etc.etc."

If there is no Santa, where do all the presents come from? Most people believe in Santa and there are lots of songs and books about him, so he must be real. \nI think that Santa skeptics close their hearts and minds to the evidence that makes it obvious that HE is with us.

"1","What is the origin of the phoenix(bird), raising from the ashes?","","In ancient Egyptian mythology and in myths derived from it, the phoenix is a mythical sacred firebird.\n\nSaid to live for 500, 1461 or for 12594 years (depending on the source), the phoenix is a male bird with beautiful gold and red plumage. At the end of its life-cycle the phoenix builds itself a nest of cinnamon twigs that it then ignites; both nest and bird burn fiercely and are reduced to ashes, from which a new, young phoenix arises. The new phoenix embalms the ashes of the old phoenix in an egg made of myrrh and deposits it in Heliopolis (""the city of the sun"" in Greek), located in Egypt. The bird was also said to regenerate when hurt or wounded by a foe, thus being almost immortal and invincible — a symbol of fire and divinity.\n\nOriginally, the phoenix was identified by the Egyptians as a stork or heron-like bird called a benu, (see Bennu), known from the Book of the Dead and other Egyptian texts as one of the sacred symbols of worship at Heliopolis, closely associated with the rising sun and the Egyptian sun-god Ra.\nOne inspiration that has been suggested for the Egyptian phoenix is a specific bird species of East Africa. This bird nests on salt flats that are too hot for its eggs or chicks to survive; it builds a mound several inches tall and large enough to support its egg, which it lays in that marginally cooler location. The convection currents around these mounds resembles the turbulence of a flame."

Keep in mind that while it is not a ""healthy"" state of mind it is, in many instances, a normal reaction to certain situations that human beings encounter in life. I quit smoking over 5 years ago and was depressed for about 6 months because of it. What I did was just stay in my routine and it passed.

"2","I have always heard that if you drive past a field with cows laying down, that means it will rain. Is this tru","Don't know if this is true but have heard it for a long time. What if only 2/3rds are laying down? 66% chance of rain? I wondered if they weren't just tired?","Supposedly the cows sense the moisture in the air and are making sure they have a dry place to lie down, or another explanation is that the cows are conserving heat by because they know the rain will make the air cooler, so they lay on the ground to stay warm. Personally, I have seen cows standing in the rain ignoring it. I wouldn't count on it. \n\nI can tell you what I do use cows to indicate. If you notice grazing cows are spread in a straight line, it might be an indicator of a fault line. The fault tends to create favorable moisture conditions and grows better grass. Sometimes the cows just want to mess with me though."

The diet needed is awfully complicated, here is a quick version for you:\n\nprotein: lean meats such as chicken, turkey, cottage cheese, protein powder, egg whites\n\ncarbs: fruits, veggies, oatmeal, pastas\n\nfats: olive oils, flaxseed oil, almonds, peanuts\n\nportion size: protein: the size of your palm\ncarb portion: 2 clenched fists\nfat portion: 1 tablespoon per meal or two thumbs for nuts\n\nthose are guidelines that work for everybody\n\nnow the second part is arm exercises:\n\nuse low repetition 6-8 reps at 3 sets of curls, dumbbell curls, preacher curls, barbell curls, wide grip,inclined curls, small grip curls, machine curls (pick 3 of those and thats your bicep workout)\n\nhigh repetitions will not work.Do not train them every day you will simply overtrain the muscles, you will build more arm muscles if you keep going when the pain is unbearable. this is done by high enough weight to stimulate all muscle fibers properly. The exercises above will stimulate your forearms as well if you do them slowly. you might also want to consider developing your triceps, as they also include a lot of forearm building exercises. Be sure to keep your rest at a minimum (15-30 seconds) between sets\n\nonly through dieting however will you achieve the striated look that pro bodybuilders have, but of course you must develop the muscle as well.\n\ngood luck, and also dont forget that there is more to a good looking body than just big arms, strive to keep a good balance!\n\nedit: yes its possible to have your veins out all the time and you dont need drugs. just follow the advice i have posted"

"3","Has anyone taken Halcion and Laughing gas?","I'm going to the dentist for a root canal this week and am supposed to take those medications. What are the side effects of them if you've taken them? Did it make you fall asleep?","I'm a dentist.\n\nHalcion is a benzodiazepine called triazolam, which is now a fairly common medication for dentists to give for anxiolysis.  Benzodiazepines include commonly known medications like Ativan (lorazepam), Valium (diazepam), and Xanax (alprazolam).  Many dentists like to titrate oral doses of triazolam to desired anxiolysis.  The typical oral dose of triazolam will not make you sleep, but it can make you a little drousy.  No two patients respond exactly the same to any medication.\n\nNitrous oxide is a general anesthetic which, fortunately, rarely induces sleep.  I don't think anyone knows specifically how it works, but it certainly works to calm patients when given at the proper doses.  Believe it or not, anesthesiologists use nitrous oxide in operating rooms in conjunction with far more potent general anesthetics that readily produce loss of consciousness.\n\nWith triazolam and nitrous together, you may sleep or you may not.  Getting you to sleep, however, is most certainly not your dentist's goal (or, at least, it shouldn't be)."

"1","does anyone really believe that dreams are things of the future or just things in our minds?","are dreams things that happened to us during the day we had the dream, things we thought about that day, things we wanted to happen or windows into the future?","I believe that dreams serve multiple purposes. The greatest being a doorway to other realms. I don't mean that in a hoaky / spacy way. I mean that as ,quite lterally, being in touch with spirits that may visit you while you're sleeping because of your receptiveness during sleep. I mean that as your own ability to tap into the deeper parts of yourself that already have answers stored there for your withdrawal, most people simply don't believe there is a place within themselves that can provide truth beyond what they understand in reality. If you wrap your head around that notion... these answers become available to you. Whether that be through futuristic prophecies, understanding your souls past, or understanding who you are today and why. I think life is all about understanding yourself and re-membering with your past. Dreams are a large part of how this happens. There is a difference between a spiritual dream and your mind taking out the days trash..though I suspect you can probably dechipher between the two. To answer your question simply... dreams serve all of the purposes you mentioned. Your job is to sort out what types of dreams you're having and interpret them appropriately. A dream log would do you wonders, write in it as soon as you wake up. There will be times when you think you didn't have a dream but if you lay in bed for a few minutes usually something will come to you. It takes time to train your mind  to remember these first words as soon as you wake - ""What was I dreaming?"" \nHope this answers your question!"
"3","Thumb burn?","i burned my thumb in the oven so i put it in a bowl of water... but now i cant take it out without my entire thumb hurting really bad. what should i do?","You should place a cold compress on your thumb.  You can use  an ice cube wrapped in a few paper towels, a bag of frozen peas or corn, etc.  Just apply pressure onto your thumb for a while.  Eventually the pain will lessen.  Later on, when the pain is not so bad, you can put some neosporin on it.  You can also take some acetaminophen or ibuprofen if it hurts, but make sure to read the instructions on the bottle before you take any.\n\nIf the burn is too bad, you will need to see a doctor for medical attention."

Plus if you have children who need daycare, you end up working to pay the babysitter. It's a shame b/c continuing their education would get them a better job but either they don't think of it that way or they're lazy and don't want to try.

Glucose of course has Calories...","The simple answer is that 1g of SPLENDA contains a fraction of a calorie, so they round down to get 0 calories.\n\nThough you might have heard anything ending in ""ose"" means sugar and should be used in moderation, sucralose, the sweetening ingredient in SPLENDA, is not recognized by the body as sugar or as a carbohydrate and has no calories. Sucralose has also been shown not to cause a rise in hemoglobin A1c (a measure of your average blood glucose level over time).\n\nSPLENDA can lower carbohydrates and calories in recipes.

The theory that the universe is finite but boundaryless is groundless at best having been built from many accepted, yet untried, pre-existing theories of the universe.  \n\nThis theory should be more approprately viewed as the culmination of everything we do not know about the universe, and is tied entirely to a singular perspective. Yet it is accepted as fact by many within the scientific community and elsewhere.\n\nBased on our current technological capabilities and observations of the universe we have no business asking science this type of question.  In turn it is irresponsible of science to supply any type of response with conviction and confidence.  \n\nTheories such as this one are no different than the assertions of any religion;  they require an enormous amount of faith to be accepted.\n\nBottom line:  your guess is just as good as anyone's."

This depends on what type of calories you burn. If you jog, for instance, you are burning aerobic calories which will not help you lose fat as well as well as if you burned fat calories. Walking is one of the best fat-burning things you can do. (make sure that it is a fast-paced walk, though)"

"1","When do you hand out religious pamphlets?","Twice now at work I have had customers hand me born again Baptist pamphlets at work. I'm a cashier so basically, I ring these people up, they pay and then they hand me a pamphlet. There is nothing about my appearance, demeanor or manner of dress at work that screams ""SINNER"" as far as I'm aware. In fact, there is no way that they could be sure, not knowing me at all, that I am not a born again Baptist. Yet no one else at my work has been handed a pamphlet on the job. So my question is this, to anyone out there who hands out religious pamphlets: do you carry a lot with you and hand them out to any convenient person, or do you only carry a few and pick out people that seem like godless heathens based on appearance?","Hmm...are you the only cashier in the place?  If so, you are the most accessible employee there, the one with the most customer contact.\n\nI do something similar.  I used to hand out tracts from the American Bible Society, when they used to have tracts with little or no commentary, just pure Scripture.  I'd hand them out at events like parades or protests or with my Halloween treats for trick-or-treaters.  Unfortunately ABS was taken over by interests that turned ABS into just another conservative-run Christian outfit, and they no longer make those commentary-free tracts.\n\nA couple of times I've written and produced my own tracts.  When I discovered Vistaprint.com, I started ordering business cards that quote Scripture and point to my websites.  I hand out such cards to cashiers, bus drivers, token booth clerks, etc.  It doesn't matter to me what they look like.  We are all sinners, and we all need God.  I also include my cards in some mailings, and sometimes include them with greeting cards, or leave them at the ATM area of my bank, on the counter.  Oh, yeah, at parades and protest and Halloween treats and such.\n\nAll that said, it's possible that your tract-givers are of the ilk that hand out their materials only to those ""sinners"" they think really need them.  Maybe something about your appearance moves them to do this.  If so, I apologize to your for their bigotted behavior.  Please don't judge Jesus by them."

I bleed very very little so that's how i know i am going to start, but for the next day and a half i spot something brown. After that i start my regular period. I am so stoked and need help?","I have found that this question of yours is NOT that unusual. When the menses begin...and each of them in your life is 'Different', there can be a starting of the menstruation cycle itself in a variety of ways. Much of this depends upon your basic health and regularity of your period, and if there is anything that is exacerbating stress, dietary factors, trauma.....these amongst many others can play a vital role in your period. The older blood is just that, and when the heavier flow comes out it brings with it the rest of this....often seen as brown and nearly grainy. Perhaps the thought of this in text is making you queasy and that is NOT my intention. It is NOT unusual for the body to start up....spot a day or two before hand and then begin the menstrual flow in its regular sequence or shall I say what is regular for you. You know your body better than anyone, and depending upon your age....other factors intervene. Age is one, again diet and exercise. Ask yourself if you're tired before this or perhaps amped ...we are ALL different. If there is a continuation of the more 'brown' or older blood, I recommed that you see a Physician....get a pelvic...for perhaps for whatever reason you might be a candidate for a D&C. Are your menses painful? If only periodically I have found that the comfort at home is warmth. Do not be afraid to soak...that is to bathe. This is hailed often, the menses as a curse, wherein it is nature's way of cleansing your uterus. It is important to at this point to say please keep your regular checkups with your gynocologist and allow your doctor to have a talk with any of your questions. I know that for myself what you have mentioned is in no way unusual. Please understand that you're NOT to keep from your physical regimen...unless you are tired..and please keep up your fluid intake.\nYour doctor will be the one to know and it might serve you well to keep a diary or small calendar in your drawer or medicine cabinet as to the regularity or the sometimes ""I didnt quite expect this.."" questions...all of this is important. As for a heavier flow, there is still no certainty that there will be a stopping or forestallig of the older blood. Please remember that it's your body and your own inherent body clock or circaddian rhythms dictate a lot of what is to happen to you during this time. I am not your doctor...this is merely my take from past experience and knowing many women who experience the very same thing. for now, I wouldn't worry, were I you, just keep track of this and see if there is any change in tha amount of days and flow. In conclusion, it sounds as though you are healthy, and don't rule ""IN"" a problem unless advised by your physician. Lastly if pain of any sort accompnies this, please inform your doctor for they can and very often WILL do a pelvic during your period. Should any problem persist, they will ( your doctor's office) refer you to a specialist if there is due cause. In and of all of this there may be the occasional fibroid or cyst. This is whyit is vital that you make and keep your appointments with your doctor."

"1","Does Koran recognize Jews’ ‘Deed of Ownership’ regarding Palestine as the Promised Land ?",""" That land, the Promised Land, was given by God to the Jews in the Bible, which is our Deed of Ownership, an ownership recognized in the Kuran itself!

Koran also recognizes that Jerusalem is the Holy Land of Jews. But this can't interpreted as a deed of ownership. \n\nJews always try to distort it by purpose in order to make Moslims to serve them for the establishment of Big Israel State between two rivers, exactly like how they convince Christians that it is a Christian duty to support Jews cause they are chosen, etc.\n\nMoslims are not taught to be hate Jews. Moslims respect them and the fact that Jerusalem is their Holy Land. Their greedy unrealistic Big Israel Utopia which is covering whole Middle East and their violance in Palestine make Moslims hate them. \n\nSee, we respect them, their Holy Land, but as usual, it is not enough, they ask for the deed of ownership. \n\n\n[62-6,7,8] : Say (O Muhammad): O ye who are Jews, if ye claim that ye are the favoured of Allah apart from (all) mankind, then long for death if you are truthful.

"3","Diabetics Only Please?","I have some questions for someone suffering w/ diabetes ... (type 2 I beleive ... not born w/ it but got it as a child) ... how hard is it to maintain your blood sugar?  if you eat junk food like m & m's, diet soda, fast food, other candies ... how hard is it to level it out??  And if you continue to go into DKA, how does this effect your body???","As a diabetic you shouldn't eat anything with sugar in it. I realize some dr say it's ok on occassion, but the problem with that is, they assume that the diabetic knows what ""occasional"" means. When I was in my teens and youth, I didn't want to deal with the fact that I had diabetes, so I ate what ever I wanted. The immidiate result was really high glucose levels for very extended amounts of time. Your body will aclimate to high sugar levels, but you will definately suffer long term consequences such as nueropathy and high blood pressure, which over time will lead to loss of feeling in the feet and hands, osteoperosis, reproductive organ malfunction or failure, blindness, strokes and/or heart attacks. \nI used to be out of controll with my blood sugar levels. The day they told me I was blind and that it would permanent if I didn't get it under control, I fixed it. Surgeries reversed the blindness, but the long term effects of being out of controll had already begun to affect me. I eventually ended up on dialisys and have begun to lose some of the feeling in my right foot. I was on dialisys for two years before getting a kidney/pancreas transplant. Any one of those complications will bring your normal life to a screaching halt.\n\nI know, It's really hard to eat right all the time. After a month or two of eating right and exercising, it will become second nature to you. I don't eat very much starch foods or carbs. Back when I went blind, that was one of the things I cut out of my diet and that was 18  years ago. I had my transplant 6 years ago, but I was so in the habit of not eating starchy and high carb foods, that even now, I feel like I have a brick in my gut and I weigh 500 pounds if I eat the average amounts of these foods. No, I'm not pencil skinny, nor would you or anyone else ever guess there was anything wrong with me in the first place. once you start eating right and working with your diabete's instead of against it, the easier it will be to live life like it should be lived.\n\nWhether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you listed some of the key foods you should stay away from. As hard as it may be, stay away from candy, foods that are high in sugar, soda pops, fast foods, fatty foods and carbs. People will tell you don't cut all carbs out of your diet, Thats what gives you energy for your muscles. And thats true, but if you eat a well balanced diet, you'll get plenty of carbs from the fruits and vegatables you eat. Yes, there is carbs in those foods."

If the thermometer does read correctly, it might see a slight temp increase from the fan, lights, and magnetron operation.\n\n3.

"3","isn't premature ejaculation curable?","i'm 27 and newly married...i'm suffering from premature ejaculation.and it's really spoiling my life.can anyone suggest to which doctor i can consult? i'm staying at bangalore,india.i'm afraid...my married life would be ruined","read this article\nhttp://www.edpills.net/article_premature_ejaculation.php\n\nIn fact, there's NO product, exercise, or technique that can stop severe premature ejaculation when used alone. NONE! Severe premature ejaculation is an extremely complex condition the causes of premature ejaculation are both physical and psychological. To cure premature ejaculation requires a combination of products that simultaneously attack and eliminate each cause. Only Last-Longer has a combination of products strong enough to eliminate ALL aspects of both the physical and psychological causes of premature ejaculation.\nQuite often, when a man gains good ejaculatory control, he suddenly becomes much more interested in sex. And even if he doesn't, it might be nicer for both of you if he lasted longer.\n\nDon't tune out your body. TUNE INTO IT. You need to become more familiar with your different levels of sexual arousal. You also need to recognize how you feel as you approach your point of ejaculatory inevitability, the ""point of no return."" Once you recognize how you feel close to your point of no return, it's not difficult to make small sexual adjustments that allow you to remain highly aroused without ejaculating.\n\nSexual arousal is a four-phase process. In the Excitement Phase, breathing deepens and erection begins. In the Plateau Stage, erection becomes full and you feel highly aroused. When arousal builds to a certain point, the next phase occurs, Orgasm with Ejaculation. Then during the Resolution Phase, breathing returns to normal and erection subsides. The key to ejaculatory control is to extend the Plateau Phase, to maintain arousal without triggering Orgasm and Ejaculation.\n\nTo learn ejaculatory control:\n\n* Don't use drugs or alcohol. They're distracting and they interfere with the self-awareness crucial to learning ejaculatory control.\n* Appreciate whole-body sensuality. Men often think sex happens only in the penis and only during intercourse. That view is a one-way ticket to uncontrolled ejaculation (not to mention erection problems, and women with those proverbial headaches). The best sex involves head-to-toe arousal. Men learning how to approach -- but not arrive at -- their point of no return, need to appreciate whole-body sensuality, the pleasure potential in every square inch of the body. Whole-body sensuality releases tension. Tense bodies that have no other outlet often find release through involuntary ejaculation. But as you learn to appreciate sensual pleasure from head to toe, whole-body arousal takes the pressure off your penis, and you last longer.\n* Whole-body sensuality means relaxation, but the ""relaxation"" involved in great sex is not the kind that includes an easy chair, a six pack, and Monday Night Football. It's the kind you feel after a hot bath or a good massage. In fact, bathing or showering together before lovemaking can help men relax and appreciate whole-body sensuality -- and last longer.\n* Breathe deeply. One very easy way to stay relaxed while making love is to breathe deeply. The body has a natural tendency to breathe deeply during sex. But many men fight it. They think they should stay in control by not breathing deeply and making the little love-moan sounds that go along with it. But when men work to control their breathing, they often sacrifice ejaculatory control. Try breathing deeply. Let your breath go. Many men are amazed how much this one little change improves their ejaculatory control.\n* Start with masturbation with a dry hand. By varying how you caress your penis, you can learn to stay highly aroused for quite a while without coming. When you feel yourself approaching your point of no return, simply back off a bit, strokestroke yourself more gently or not at all, and stay aroused without ejaculating. Then as you feel yourself getting a little distance from your point of no return, return to more vigorous self-stimulation. Repeat this s"
"1","Communism..Why is and was it vilified and considered evil??","If communism is a pure state where all are equal financially and culturally, why consider it evil?? Is it not merely the desire of certain elite individuals to consider themselves more equal than others that caused the system to fail?? What would be wrong with equal medical and social systems for all??","Think about it for a moment. The core concept of Comunism is that all are equal right?  For all to be equal that means you must bring everybody down to the lowest common denominator. How else can such equality be achieved?  You can only bring certain people up to a certain level. There are inherent physical limits that all people are born with. Some may be good at one thing or another. To equalize people is to bring them down to what the weakest link is capable of. In effect you make the whole chain as strong as the weakest link. \n\nLets look at Comunism on a grand scale. In a pure Commie society you have each person assigned to what is judged to be their best place to contribute to society. On the top it sounds great right? Of course everybody assumes they'll get one of the good jobs. Most jobs suck. So most people will get stuck doing something they hate. If you take it to it's literal ends, then all good jobs would be removed because by deffinition they set somebody up as elite. Astronauts, musicians, atheletes, and so on. By being made one of those they are instantly made elite.  In reality many of these jobs are necessary to the functioning of society. So the absolute ideal is literally impossible.  Not everybody is capable of singing.  To make somebody who can sing like an Angel tote garbage while forcing a tone deaf person to do vocals is a bigger injustice than creating an elite because of an innate ability they are born with.  Not everybody can be a rocket scientist or a skilled surgeon. Would you honestly want randomly chosen people to be your doctor if your life was on the line? \n\nSo even with the best intents Comunism does and by necessity has to put people up as elite.  Instead of people choosing their field and putting their talents out there for the general public to judge relitive talent another group of elites judge. You have to have somebody to decide who does what. Who allocate resources and people to tasks. I guess technically today you could use computers  to do that with standardized testing. However what about subjective areas such as art? How can a computer judge that?  Or do you do away with arts all together? \n\nNext comes the biggest hidden injustice of all socialisms. The very core ideal of socialism of any sort relies on each person carrying out the collective will.  For it to work each person MUST work inside the collective will.  By deffinition every dissenter, every person who does not abide by the collective will damages the collective. They reduce the already margional tolerances the society has for survival. Dissenters are a threat to the survival of a collective society. If any large movement starts the collective will collapses. For it to exist the collective MUST have almost unanimous support. Each person must strive to carry out their part of the collective efforts. If the shoemakers for example dissent, then everybody goes without shoes. If the farmers do not pull their share of the work, then everybody starves. So every person must do their assigned work to the best of their ability. \n\nNow think about that for a moment. Try to picture getting 100 of even like minded people to agree completely on even the implementation of a goal they all want. I've never seen it happen. There has always been egos, power plays, disagreements over methods, laziness, poor judgement, emotionalism, favortism and a hundred other very human things which interfere with the collective. It's natural. It is to be human to dissent. To feel that your own opinion and worth is greater than others. \n\nAs a result, the collective to survive must prevent dissent. They must curtail any actions which prevent people from doing anything but their best for the collective. All must volentarily bow to the collective will or the collective will becomes a tyranny. Since you cannot get functional humans to lose such things as ego, subjective emotions such as taste, opinion and belief. Then such traits must b"

"2","Have any new species evolved since we began study of evolution?","By new species I mean some plant or animal that is capable of sexual reproduction but cannot interbreed with it's parent species.","Yes.\n\nSpartina anglica is a species which reproduces sexually and naturally mutated late in the 19th century from a parent species which only reproduces vegetably. Originally it was an accidental hybrid between S. maritima and the closely related S. alterniflora and incapable of producing seeds, but capable of spreading by vegetative means. A mutation allowed S. anglica to begin producing viable seeds, but it does not hybridize with either S. maritima or S. alterniflora due to chromasome doubling. This species normally out-competes other cord grasses, so it would be difficult to maintain the position that this is some sort of ""slow decline in species"" as it is a prime example of survival of the fittest and there is some concern it will lead to the extinction of some of the species that were it's ancestors."

[The evidence that this grave is attended, visited and cared for, is respectful for the deceased - NS]. Also, it may hark back to biblical days when the monument was a heap of stones.

"3","what is osteoarthritis?","","•  Osteoarthritis  \n\nOsteoarthritis (OA, also known as degenerative arthritis or degenerative joint disease, and sometimes referred to as ""arthrosis"" or ""osteoarthrosis""), is a condition in which low-grade inflammation results in pain in the joints, caused by wearing of the cartilage that covers and acts as a cushion inside joints. As the bone surfaces become less well protected by cartilage, the patient experiences pain upon weight bearing, including walking and standing. Due to decreased movement because of the pain, regional muscles may atrophy, and ligaments may become more lax. OA is the most common form of arthritis. The word is derived from the Greek word ""osteo"", meaning ""of the bone"", ""arthro"", meaning ""joint"", and ""itis"", meaning inflammation, although many sufferers have little or no inflammation. \n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis\n------------------------------------\n \n\n-------------------------------------\n\nBrittanica\nA disorder of the joints, characterized by progressive deterioration of the articular cartilage. It is the most common joint disease, affecting more than 80 percent of those who reach the age of 70.

The number of possible choices for the first person is n, for the second person n-1, and so on until we reach n - k + 1. Thus, we get the equation P(k)*C(n, k) = P(n, k) = n*(n - 1)*...*(n - k + 1) = n!/(n - k)!.

"1","Could Xena and Gabrielle (From Xena Warrior Princess) be based on these characters in mythology?","""Do you Agree that Xena could be based on these characters from Greek mythology:\n> Bellona - roman goddess of war,\n> Atalanta - huntress and athlete,\n> Diana - goddess of the moon and a huntress,\n> Artemis - the virgin huntress - but only the huntress part applies to\n> Xena.\n> Themis - goddess of law and justice.\n> Nemesis - goddess of retribution.\n> Nike (Victoria) - goddess of victory.\n> Penthesilea - Queen of the Amazons.\n> There was a Goddess called Polyxena - she was put to death by Achilles\n> ghost.\n\nI got that info from the link below\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.tv/msg/a5a78c34910d75a8?q=achilles+greek+mythology&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&rnum=41\n\nCould she also be based on this charater:\nIxion is a fundamental character in Greek mythology. The most complete account of Ixion's tale comes from Pindar in his Pythian Odes. Ixion was the son the Phlegyas, descendent of Ares, and king of the Lapiths in Thessaly. He is significant in many respects, but is chiefly known as the first human to shed kindred blood. This occurred when Ixion invited his father-in-law, Deioneus, to come and collect the price that Ixion owed him for his bride. Upon his arrival, Deioneus fell into a pit filled with burning coals Ixion had camouflaged.\n\nBecause this was a crime new to the human race, nobody could purify Ixion and he wandered an exile. Zeus took pity on him and decided not only to purify Ixion, but to invite him to Olympus as a guest. Once in Olympus though, Ixion became so enamored of Hera, and he desired to sleep with her. Zeus did not believe that Ixion would be so disrespectful as to have designs upon the wife of his host. To see if the rumors were true, Zeus made an image of Hera out of a cloud, and impregnated it. The cloud bore Ixion the monster Centaurus, who was unloved by the Graces and had no honor among men or the gods. Centaurus then mated with the mares of Mt. Pelion in Magnesia, and so from Ixion the race of centaurs was born.\n\nTo punish him, Zeus bound Ixion to a winged (sometimes flaming) wheel, which revolved in the air in all directions. Also, by order of the gods, Ixion was forced to call out continuously call out: ""You should show gratitude to your benefactor."" Ixion became one of the more famous sinners on display on Tartarus, and most writers mention him when describing the place. For example, Ovid wrote of him, and Vergil, with his moralistic interpretation of how sin should be punished, awards Ixion a special mention in the Aenead.\n\nThe focus of Ixion's mythology on the guest/host relationship shows the venerable age of Ixion's story. Of all the attributes Zeus became associated with, he was originally particularly worried that the custom of Xenia, the formal institution of friendship that ensured traveling archaic Greeks could count on each other for safety in antiquity, be enforced (for more on this in all the Greek world see Powell 150; the importance of the guest/host relationship is fundamental to all world mythology, take the Biblical story of Sodom and Gommorah, for example).\n\nAeschylus remembered Ixion's role as the purified progenitor of blood guilt in the Euminides. Athena, before she will hear Orestes' case refers to him as Ixion, an allusion Orestes balks at and tries to convince her is false (Euminides. 450-455).\n\nPirithous, king of the Lapiths, good friend of Theseus, and important in later myth, is considered to be one of Ixion's children. There is another claimant to Pirithous' paternity though. Zeus, in the Iliad 14. 317-318, claims to have seduced Dia, Ixion's wife, and fathered Pirithous.\n\nI got that info from this link: http://www.pantheon.org/articles/i/ixion.html\n\nXena could be based on that character because the name sounds simalar.\n\nCould Gabrielle be based on this character:\nThere is only one character from myth, fable, or history that relates to Gabrielle, Xena's fa","the characters are based on Greek mythology"

Thanks!!","At one point in my life I was really depressed. i'm talking clinical depression here, the kind you get when the chemicals in your brain get mixed up. i was a Christian at this point, but had been drifting away from God.\nanyway, i was standing by my window one day. at this point i was closer to committing suicide then i had ever been, and was contemplating the action right then. as i stood there, i suddenly felt this overwhelming prescence.\ni can't really describe what happened next, (it's too personal) but God came to me. i spent some time in prayer, just pouring out my heart. when i left my room, i felt like a completely different person. everything literally looked brighter.\n5 years later, i'm still following the Lord and couldn't be happier. i really believe that God saved my life that day, both spiritually and physically."

"3","how can i lose 30 pounds in two months?","","Absolutely possible! My Aunt (45 years old, approx. 5'4"" 200 lbs) lost 40 pounds in 2 months.\n\nHow did she do it? How does anybody do it without starving yourself or leading an unhealthy/impossible to keep up with exercise schedule?\n\n1. Write your current weight down on a piece of paper. Divide that number in half. Whatever that final number is, drink that many OUNCES of water EVERY DAY.\n  -- For every 20 minutes of exercise, drink an additional 8 ounces of water\n\n2. Eat Less PER MEAL. I don't know what your average meal is but for faster metabolism and better digestion, stick to eating ONE TYPE of food per meal.  (Large, complex meals are SLOW to digest, slow to metabolize, and in general, bog down your entire system).\n\n3. Eat more often (less per meal). Bodies goes into 'starvation' mode long before you feel hunger pangs. Keep that metabolism revved by eating consistently, giving yourself constant energy. \n\n4. Stop eating processed foods and sugars, to start. That's ALL you have to give up with, for starters, so don't freak out. :) They are the 2 most contributing factors for over-eating and weight gain.\n\n5. Cut off all eating 3 hours before you go to bed. Whenever your bed time is... 7pm, 10pm, 1AM, STOP eating 3 hours before bed.\n\n6. Take a quaint stroll around the block every night. Start with 15 minutes. Then increase whatever you would like. The idea isn't so much to get in a lot of exercise but walking keeps your joints loose, your muscles warmed and flexible, keeps your body fluids moving, oxygenates the blood and stimulates good digestion.\n\n7. Eat your fruit in the morning and afternoon. NOT in the evening or nighttime. Your system slows down as the day wears on and the sugars will metabolize slower. You don't want that! Fruit is a means of virtually instantaneous energy and cellular revitalization, therefore avoid it later in the day and enjoy it in the morning.\n\n8. Eat more raw vegetables!! :) At least half of your daily food intake should be vitamin & mineral-rich fiberous veggies! Snack as much as you like on carrots and celery and radishes and tomatoes and basically, whatever is in season and tastes good to you :) Make GIANT salads with loads of vegetables with yummy homemade olive oil (a great fat!) and vinegar or lemon juice dressing! Add some olives and seafood and even some noodles.  Use ingredients you REALLY LIKE! YUmmmm!!\n\n9. Get your 7-9 hours of sleep every night!! So vitally important! ZZzzzZZZZzz's give you healing, regeneration and actually quickens weight loss! \n\n10. Realize that whatever you do NOW to lose the weight HAS TO be something you can do LONG TERM or it will never last.  Go to a bookstore and find a neat food or cooking book to inspire you. \n\nThe truth is, you can healthily lose even more than 30 pounds in 2 months. It's up to you how much you end up losing. If you want diet suggestions or vitamin supplement recommendations, or have any other questions, ask away!\n\nI think, just by asking, you've already taken the hardest but most powerful step! \n\nI wish you the best!"

"2","How can an artificial sweetener contain no calories?","","Artificial sweeteners activate the ""sweet"" areas of our taste buds, but do not have caloric content because they are not digested by the body for energy.\n\nThe human body is very specific about the stereochemistry of the compounds it recognizes and uses for ""food"".  Many, if not most nutrients have stereoisomers -- the chemical can be seen to be right-handed or left-handed.   IIRC, the chemicals that can be used for food by the human body are generally the ""left-handed"" stereoisomer.  This is the secret behind Splenda -- the new sugar substitute.  It is exactly the same chemical composition as sucrose, but in the right-handed configuration.  So the body cannont digest it, and therefore it is sweet without containing any useable calories."

Do you believe that if you just insult Christians enough by calling them idiots that they will suddenly accept you r way of thinking?

Has anyone ever been considered a minority like this?","Sure, white people can be considered a minority; it just depends on the scale you're looking at.  If you're talking about the United States, you will never hear white people referred to as a minority category, even though I think I recently heard they have fallen below 50% of the population; it's just that no other ethnic group has a greater percentage.  But if you're looking at a neighborhood, or even a city or state, it is quite possible for white people to be the minority.  I'm white, and I used to live in Harlem, so I was definitely a minority.  I got called ""whitey"" quite often... but then maybe I asked for it, as I was training for long-distance road races at the time, running through Harlem in really short shorts and no shirt!  Anyway, I think it's a valuable experience for everyone to be put in the position of being a visible minority at least once in their life."

"2","is it possible to exert a force and yet not cause a change in kinetic energy?","","The kinetic energy changes proportionately to the dot product of the force and the direction of motion.  If the object is always moving at right angles to the force, there is no change in kinetic energy.\n\nThe most obvious example is a planet in a circular orbit around a star.  The star exerts a constant force on the planet, but the planet's kinetic energy never changes because the force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion.\n\nThis is a case where a non-zero net force results in no change in kinetic energy."

It's an important and densely packed area containing many bundles of nerves carrying movement and sensory messages between the brain and the body. It also acts as a junction box for all the nerves employed in coordinating movement and balance within the head and neck, as well as the body as a whole.\n\n\n\nBecause there are so many important structures within the brainstem one small area of damage due to stroke can have wide-ranging consequences. The exact symptoms depend on which biological ‘electrical circuits’ and junctions lose their blood supply and that in turn depends on which of the small blood vessels in the area (branches of the vertebrobasilar circulation) becomes blocked.\n\n\n\nThe symptoms can include difficulties with balance (ataxia), dizziness due to vertigo, uncoordinated eye movements, problems with swallowing and articulating words, and numbness and/ or weakness in one half of the body. It is not uncommon for victims of this sort of stroke to feel sick as part of the loss of balance.\n\n\n\nRecovery really depends on the extent and severity of the initial stroke. You need to discuss the outlook with the doctors who have investigated your mother's condition. I really hope she is only mildly affected and makes a reasonable recovery.\n     THANK YOU VERY MUCH"

It's important to know what animals eat the seeds or fruits of flowering trees to deduce it's role in a given ecosystem.

In other words, as trees get chopped down and various animal species that depend on the trees start to die, that is then a useful barometer of the trees role in the ecosystem."

Thank you...","The pure and applied science can be differentiated as:\nPure science - motivated by curiosity \nApplied science - designed to answer specific questions. \n\nGiven these definitions, I will later argue that governments have a special responsibility to fund basic science while applied science can generally be left to industry. The distinction is, of course, not always entirely clear cut, and the term ""strategic research"" is sometimes used to describe science in an intermediate category which appears to have a good chance of applications even if it is done to satisfy curiosity, and is leading to new fundamental understandings. An example is research on the properties of two-dimensional semiconductors.\n\nThe difference between pure, and applied science was beautifully illustrated by J.J. Thomson - the discoverer of the electron - in a speech delivered in 1916 :\n\n""By research in pure science I mean research made without any idea of application to industrial matters but solely with the view of extending our knowledge of the Laws of Nature. I will give just one example of the ""utility"" of this kind of research, one that has been brought into great prominence by the War - I mean the use of X-rays in surgery......Now how was this method discovered? It was not the result of a research in applied science starting to find an improved method of locating bullet wounds. This might have led to improved probes, but we cannot imagine it leading to the discovery of the X-rays. No, this method is due to an investigation in pure science, made with the object of discovering what is the nature of Electricity."""

"1","Fellow Christians (or anyone) What are your views on the origin of the world and people?","this is basically Creationism vs. Evolution","think about the eye.  it's no good if all you have is an eyeball, yet lack an optic nerve to transmit the light as an electric signal, or an occipital cortex to interpret the electric pulses back into a picture.\n\nso how could the eye have evolved?  suppose some primordial worm starts getting two black dots on its head that will eventually turn into eyes.  suppose they eventually turn into eyes.  he still can't see.  this is not a viable mutation as it has no possible survival value or advantage over the other plain ol' worms.  an eye is no good unless every other part of the visual system is already intact.\n\nso a gradual evolving a pair of eyes won't work, since it will hinder the creature's survival before it will actually help it out.  the only way natural selection favours evolutionary andvancements is through ''hopeful monsters.'' a lizard hatching a bird, a worm with no eyes giving rise to one with eyes in a single generation.\n\nand that's another thing.  what if a lizard tried to grow longer and longer scales in hopes that they'd one day become feathers?  well, there comes a point where this lizard has half feather/scales, on some rather cumbersome, yet extremely fragile wing-like ''hands,'' which it can no longer use for running from predators, yet, it still cannot fly.  natural selection would quickly weed out such a transitional creature.\n\nand that's another thing...where are all these transitional fossils that had to be here?  since evolution took place over millions and millions of years, right?  (the earth's age is actually closer to what the bible says, anyway, as the speed of light is slowing down, and used to be much much faster in the past, according to modern quantum physics and other considerations, [see sources] so radioactive decay used to be much faster in the past, making radio-carbon dating yeild ages far too old)....there actually wasn't even enough time for things to evolve.  the only way evolution could've happened was by hopeful monsters...\n\nwhat about the peppered moth, mike?  what about it?  there's a variation in the species.  what about red heads and brunettes? ;-)  okay, what about the tiny 18 inch tall horses in fossil records?  well, modern, wild brown horses can be selectively bred to get tiny little horses like that.  yes, it takes about 80 years, but it can be done.  (evolutionists tend to call this ''micro-evolution'' just to get a foothold ;-)  )  what's more, regular house cats have been successfully bred with lions to produce ''medium sized'' cats.  this only shows that there is a wide variance in the species, but it's still one kind.  evolution states that one species will change so much over a period of time that it cannot breed with other species that have branched off in different directions."

How do you make it?","Making of Fertilizers:\nBasically, fertilizers are made from ammonia..I will take you through four stages that are basically followed in order to make ammonia..mind it that I am talking about artificial fertilizers not natural ones like cow dung which is not man-made...Alright then,\n\nSTAGE 1: Haber Process\n\nThis is a reversible reaction and an exothermic reaction thats used to make Nitrogen and Hydrogen under low temperatures (about 750 degrees celcius) and high pressures (about 30 atmospheres with a catalyst of nickel)..The reaction for this equation is:\n\nN2 + 3H2 <---> 2NH3  (-92kJmol -1)\nNitrogen + Hydrogen <---> Ammonia\n\nNow we have got our ammoina..which is the raw material in the production of fertilizers..Lets move on to the 2nd step...\n\nSTAGE 2: Ammonia being converted into Nitrogen Monoxide..\n\nIn this stage, we are going to let ammonia (which we got from the Haber process) react with oxygen to form nitrogen monoxide and water..\nFor this reaction to take place..we need to apply heat and catalyst (not so sure of which catalyst). We need to apply 230 degrees celcius of heat for heating air and ammonia). So, here's the reaction equation for that:\n\n4NH3(g)  +  5O2(g)  --->  4NO(g)  +  6H20(l)\n\nWe've got our Nitrogen monoxide now..so let's move on..\n\n\nSTAGE 3: Converting Nitrogen Monoxide into Nitric Acid\n\nIn this reaction we are going to react Nitrogen Monoxide with Oxygen and Steam to obtain Nitric Acid like this:\n\n4NO(g) + 3O2(g) + 2H2O(g) ---> 4NO3(aq)\n\nSTAGE 4: Converting this Nitric Acid into Ammonium Nitrate\n\nSo, Now nitric acid is going to be reacted with Ammonia (from Haber Process again..) in an addition reaction. Ammonium Nitrate in this case, will be our fertilizer..So, this is the final stage.. <Phweks!!> Here we go:\n\nNH2(g)  +  HNO3(aq)  --->  NH4NO3(aq)\nAmmonia gas + Nitric Acid ---> Ammonium Nitrate!!!\n\n\nUses:\nThe ions these fertilizers contain enrichen the soil very much..Ions like the nitrates and phosphates are absorbed by the plants through osmosis from the soil..These ions then help the plant in various stuff like synthesising the chlorophyll molecule..some like nitrates are converted into plant proteins...\n\nOk, I guess I have exhausted everything I know about fertilizers...\n\nI really hope it was of some help for u...   :)"

And if you don't then why are you in a religion that does?  I, too, was born a Catholic but once I started reading the bible, I could see the evil in the religion and had to get out.  Most Catholics seem to pick and choose what parts of Catholism they want to keep and what parts they  want to toss out and think it's ok to stay in it. God called Israel a harlot for tolerating pagan practices like these.  He said of the great harlot in Rev. ""Come out of her my people"".

Tegretol worked for me, (it is anti-convulsant) although I would still have episodes. If that doesn't work, other anti-convulsants may. It generally can't be cured (in the sense that it will go away. There may be long periods of time where you won't have the symptoms. No one really knows what causes it, or rather there may be many reasons. My doctor discovered that I have a herpes virus next to my trigeminal nerve back in my head. I don't have herpes anywhere else. He guesses it was probably there for ages, maybe since childhood. Something shifted and antigonized the virus. I am on herpes medication, and I haven't had another episode. Go figure. You may have to mess around with meds til you find what works.

You will also be given a medication that will make you relaxed but you will still be awake during the procedure.

How do you get a blood infection?","","An infection starts in another area and if it goes untreated or treated with the wrong antibioitic or depending where the infection is it can seep into the blood stream.  Say you have deep cut that you thought was nothing and ignored it.  Bacteria could enter the cut and cause an infection.  The infection can get so deep into the skin that it could go into the blood stream or the bone (called osteomylitis).  I have seen kids get a positive blood culute from an ear infection, urinary tract infection, and even a sore on the bottom of the foot.  Bottom line, keep cuts clean, take all your antibiotics if a doctor prescribes it and call the doctor for fevers, redness, swelling or increased pain.  All signs an infection can be present.

I looked a mobile hanging motionless, and said, ""If there is anyone else here, make the mobile spin."" The next moment, the mobile began to spin.\n\nOne time I was driving into Ponca State Park to set up a large camping gathering, and the sides of the road were lined with spirits. All standing there, clearly visible to everyone, calmly welcoming us back.\n\nOn another camping trip, we felt a spirit near the bon-fire. We had a ring of 40 tiki-torches around the bonfire. It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired. The repairman asked if she'd been in a nuclear power plant. All the innards were fried from electromagnetism\n\nMy grandmother died while my niece was in utero. After my niece was born, she would look up at areas where no one was standing, and laugh and giggle. We all knew that she was looking at gramma, so we never showed her any pictures. Finally, at about a year old, she could speak, and my sister showed her the family photo album. My niece picked out her photo and said, ""That's Old Gramma."""
"2","Does the Earth's rotational speed affect the moon's orbital radius?","Another one of those high school physics things has come back to haunt me.  I seem to recall a teacher telling me there was a relationship between the Earth's rotation speed and the distance of the moon.  Something along the lines of if the moon were to drift farther away, it would have an effect on the Earth's rotation..  hence the length of our days.\n\nIs this true?  If it is, what is the name of the gravitational principle?","The name of the principle is conservation of angular momentum.\nL = Iw, where I is the moment of inertia of an object, and w is the angular velocity of the object.  L is the angular momentum of the object.\nThe angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system is L(net) = L(Earth) + L(Moon).  The Earth has a moment of inertia of [2/5]mr^2, and a certain angular velocity (m is the mass of the Earth, r is the radius of the earth).  The Moon has a moment of inertia of MR^2, where R is the orbital distance of the Moon from the Earth and M is the mass of the Moon.\nSo, L(net) = [2/5]mr^2 (w-Earth) + MR^2 (w-Moon), where w-Earth and w-Moon are the angular velocities of the two.\nIf w-Earth (the rotation speed of the Earth) were to go down, one of the other quantities would have to increase.  Since the mass and radius of the Earth are pretty much set, as is the mass of the Moon, it would have to be the orbital radius of the Moon or the angular velocity of the Moon that would need to increase.  The two are positively related, so they would both increase.\nOr, if the Moon were to randomly move farther away, the Earth's rotation would slow down, and our days would get longer."
"3","Is it safe to have intercourse at the age of 18 with my boss who is 31?What are all the precautions?","","I don't think it is a good idea to do that. The precautions you should take is have condoms, be on birth control, get a sponge or don't have intercourse with your boss at all."

"1","Okay, so what is the difference between an athiest and an agnostic?","I know there is one, I just don't know what exactly it is.\nAre they at all simliar?\nProbably not?","Atheist versus agnostic?\n\nFrom the American Heritage Dictionary:\n\nAgnos·tic - One who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God but does not deny the possibility that God exists.\n\nAtheism 1.a. Disbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods. b. The doctrine that there is no God or gods. 2. Godlessness; immorality.\n\nIn other words,\nthe agnostic doubts that God exists but leaves the finding of God open as a possibility (""gnosis"" knowing, seeing; ""a"" not)\n\nThe atheist denies that God exists (""a"" not; ""theo"" God).\n\nThis raises the question, ""How could we prove God?"" \n\nGod has no image, says the Bible. That is, with scientific means as practiced nowadays in a materialistic way, we will not be able to prove God!\n\nHowever, advanced logic may lead us to realize that their must a God, Creator of all things and in all things, as the Bible states.\n\nGood question. Thanks.\nCordially, India.Magica"

"3","Are children of ADHD truely helped by medication?","","Definitely.   These days, our medications are so advanced that there is a pill that can virtually target any sympton in the body.  The past 10 years for medicine has been the biggest breakthrough decade (partly due to the internet).  ADHD is actually sluggish brainwaves and as a result, many distractions come into the brain because nevers aren't traveling back and forth at a fast enough rate (totally opposite of what most people think).  And there are medications that can go exactly to those nerves and speed them up causing more focus which automatically calms a kid.  Truly amazing.   I am not saying I'm an advocate of pills at all, but if someone's quality of life is suffering,,,,maybe it's an option.  The question was about being helped so I answered accordingly!!"

"3","Why is my menstrual period late?","","There are many factors that can make a period late including pregnancy, medication, stress, hormonal imbalance, just to name a few.\nIf you feel that you are pregnant the best thing to do would be to to wait until 2 weeks after a missed period, and have your doctor perform a pregnancy blood test as this is more accurate.

"3","how do people got cancer?","","Matt and Bert are both correct but there are so many factors.  Some kinds of cancer seems to ""run"" in families.  Recent things I've read indicate that if all men lived to be 80 years old almost all of them would have prostate cancer.  Many kinds of cancer seem to be affected by poor diet, though not directly caused by it.  Smoking and other pollution and chemicals in the environment seem to have an effect.  People who are obese seem to be more likely to get certain kinds of cancer.\n\nThe bottom line is that there is no simple answer to your question.  Do some internet searches for differnt kinds of cancer and you'll get more specific information."

And when people hopefully grow up knowing about all the different cultures maybe will get along with each other in work situations and schools."
"1","Has anyone converted to Catholicism from a Protestant background?","I do not want to hear about converting because of marriage or something where your heart wasn't in it. If it was other than this, why did you convert? Was it because you were dissatisfied with something in the Protestant services, you had a revelation that Catholicism was the truest form of Christianity, or something else. Please only those that converted out of heart felt reasons answer, and not those that were coerced or something and you could care less about Jesus. (like it seems so many are when it is Prot=>Cath) Please convince me otherwise.","I was born and raised Southern Baptist.  I never felt at home in that faith.  I always felt like an outsider looking in.  I went to church Sun morn, Sun eve and Wed eve every week without fail for my entire childhood.\n\nI graduated from high school and moved out on my own.  After a period of staying out of churchs completely, I felt empty in my heart.  After a lot of soul searching I figured out that the emptiness in my heart was due to my being out of the will of God.  In order to fill that emptiness I had to reconcile myself to God. \n\nI tried going back to the Baptist Church, but I still never felt like I was a part of that.  At the time I worked with two Catholics.  They had a peace about them that I wanted in my life!  They talked openly about being Catholic, they weren't ashamed of it.  And I could tell that being Catholic was a big part of their entire life--not just a trip to church twice on Sunday and once on Wednesday nite.\n\nSo I did some more research.  I liked what I read about the Catholic faith.  And I began to take instruction in the Catholic faith.  This has been one of the hardest things I've ever done in my whole life.  All my life as a Baptist I was taught that Catholics were going to hell because they worshipped Mary and the Saints.  That they prayed to statues.  That the Roman Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon mentioned in the Book of Revelation.  That you ask Jesus to forgive you, not a man---even if the man is a priest.  And so on and so forth, ad infinitum ad nauseum.\n\nIt took a lot of study and prayer to find the answers to all those bogus notions I'd been taught.  Catholics don't worship Mary or the Saints--we venerate them.  We don't pray to statues---that's just dumb.  I don't believe the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon.  Jesus gave the power to forgive sins and cast out demons in his Name to his disciples.  And its ok to confess your sins to a priest.  \n\nI took instruction for about six months.  I joined the Catholic Church about 25 years ago and I've never regretted a minute of it.  I finally feel at home in a church.  I'm active in my local Church--I help out at Mass and I teach in our Parish School of Religion.  \n\nI have a peace in my heart and soul that I never felt when I was Baptist.   And I still hear the same bone headed things that I heard as a kid about Catholics.\n\nHas this cost me anything?  Yes.  My father, a die-hard Baptist, never accepted my conversion.  Until his dying day he still would not talk about it.  That hurt a lot.\n\nBut I have a church home now--and a solid faith in my Lord Jesus--who saves me from my sinful nature by his Grace alone.  I can't earn my salvation--its a gift from the Lord.  \n\nWould I do it over again?  Yes---although I probably would've not drug my heels so much and made the conversion much sooner."

"2","Why are some people double jointed?","","Generally, double jointedness describes people who can stretch their joints further than 'normal'.\n\nCauses include: abnormally-shaped ends of one or more bones at a joint, weak or stretched ligaments, low muscle tone, abnormal joint proprioception (an impaired ability to determine where in space parts of the body are, and how stretched a joint is)\n\nSuch 'hypermobility' may not be indicative of any underlying medical conditions, and (natural) double jointedness is genetic in origin. Having said that, people who are double jointed can be prone to injury to the joints and muscle problems (since muscles have to stretch further with the movement of the joint)."

I was at a lunch celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Apollo/Soyuz mission. But I didn't get called on during the Q&A). rats.","The landing method may have something to do with the design shape. The American capsule landed in the ocean and a conical shape makes it float up-right. The occupants then had to wait in the capsule to be recovered. The Russian capsule lands on dry land and the occupants can immediately exit the vehicle and wait to be picked up, therefore, no need for the conical shape to remain up-right. Those reasons, along with differing design philosophies are probably the only reasons for the difference."

Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low (which is typical in Fibro) it can cause are cramps, spasms, and pain.) Also, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder and certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro. Try eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from their diet. I did and some of my symptoms (chronic headaches and nausea) went away. It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup.

"2","My birthdate is totally prime numbers, does that make me special?","The year - 1957 (yes I'm that old) :)\nThe month - July - i.e. 7\nThe day - 23\n\nIn fact I can't remember of anyone I know who is born on a totally prime date. (Of course this question is more of a trivia than a math question! But I like this section better!))","There's a mistake in your question.  But I'm going to write this assuming your question is correct.  See the very end of my answer for an important point.\n\nWhether you're ""special"" depends on your definition of special, I guess.  It does put you in a fairly rare class of dates.\n\nLet's look at the likelihood of having a birthdate that matches your conditions.\n\n1) The year of your birth is a prime number.\n2) The month of your birth is a prime number.\n3) The day-of-the-month of your birth is a prime number.\n\nIn the past 100 years, there were only 13 years that were prime:  1907, 1913, 1931, 1933, 1949, 1951, 1973, 1979, 1987, 1993, 1997, 1999, and 2003.\n\nIn any given year, there are only five months that are prime:  2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nAnd in a given month, there are only eleven possible days that are prime, though not all of these occur in every month:  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31.\n\nLet's calculate how many total days there were in the past 100 years, and how many of those dates meet your criteria.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the total number of days in the past 100 years, ignoring leap years (we'll add those in later).  Every year has 365 days, so 365 times 100 equals 36,500.\n\nNow, let's add in the leap years.  Leap years come every 4 years, except that if a year is divisible by 100, it's not a leap year.  Except if it's divisble by 400, it is a leap year.  The only ""exceptional"" year in the past 100 years is the year 2000, and that's divisible by 400, so it was a leap year.  So there were twenty-five leap years over the past 100 years (the period from April 22, 1906 through April 21, 2006).\n\nSo the total number of days in the past 100 years is 36,525.\n\nNow, how many of those dates fit your criteria?\n\nIn a non-leap year, there are 52 dates that fit your criteria.  All leap years are divisible by four, and thus they are not prime numbers, so we can completely ignore leap years in this calculation.  The dates are:\n\nFebruary 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23\nMarch 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31\nMay 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31\nJuly 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31\nNovember 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n\nAdd them up, and you'll see there are 52 of them.  52 dates per year, multiplied by thirteen years that are prime comes out to 676.\n\nSo out of 36,525 dates someone might have been born in the past 100 years, only 676 of them meet your criteria.  That's about 1.85% of them.\n\nSo, if we assume that the odds of being born on any given date is about equal (not true) and that a given person is a random age between 0 and 100 (also not true), they have about a 1.85% chance of meeting your criteria.\n\nHOWEVER, and here we get to the mistake in your question, you were not born on a date with all prime numbers.  1957 is not a prime number; its factors are 19 and 103 (19 * 103 = 1957).\n\nSo it turns out you're not special at all.  You're just normal, like the rest of us.  :)"

"2","how earth formed?","","Big Bang Theory\nI  INTRODUCTION \n\nBig Bang Theory, currently accepted explanation of the beginning of the universe. The big bang theory proposes that the universe was once extremely compact, dense, and hot. Some original event, a cosmic explosion called the big bang, occurred about 13.7 billion years ago, and the universe has since been expanding and cooling. \n\nThe theory is based on the mathematical equations, known as the field equations, of the general theory of relativity set forth in 1915 by Albert Einstein. In 1922 Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann provided a set of solutions to the field equations. These solutions have served as the framework for much of the current theoretical work on the big bang theory. American astronomer Edwin Hubble provided some of the greatest supporting evidence for the theory with his 1929 discovery that the light of distant galaxies was universally shifted toward the red end of the spectrum (see Redshift). Once “tired light” theories—that light slowly loses energy naturally, becoming more red over time—were dismissed, this shift proved that the galaxies were moving away from each other. Hubble found that galaxies farther away were moving away proportionally faster, showing that the universe is expanding uniformly. However, the universe’s initial state was still unknown. \n\nIn the 1940s Russian-American physicist George Gamow worked out a theory that fit with Friedmann’s solutions in which the universe expanded from a hot, dense state. In 1950 British astronomer Fred Hoyle, in support of his own opposing steady-state theory, referred to Gamow’s theory as a mere “big bang,” but the name stuck. Indeed, a contest in the 1990s by Sky & Telescope magazine to find a better (perhaps more dignified) name did not produce one.\n\nII  HISTORY \n\nThe overall framework of the big bang theory came out of solutions to Einstein’s general relativity field equations and remains unchanged, but various details of the theory are still being modified today. Einstein himself initially believed that the universe was static. When his equations seemed to imply that the universe was expanding or contracting, Einstein added a constant term to cancel out the expansion or contraction of the universe. When the expansion of the universe was later discovered, Einstein stated that introducing this “cosmological constant” had been a mistake. \n\nAfter Einstein’s work of 1917, several scientists, including the abbé Georges Lemaître in Belgium, Willem de Sitter in Holland, and Alexander Friedmann in Russia, succeeded in finding solutions to Einstein’s field equations. The universes described by the different solutions varied. De Sitter’s model had no matter in it. This model is actually not a bad approximation since the average density of the universe is extremely low. Lemaître’s universe expanded from a “primeval atom.” Friedmann’s universe also expanded from a very dense clump of matter, but did not involve the cosmological constant. These models explained how the universe behaved shortly after its creation, but there was still no satisfactory explanation for the beginning of the universe. \n\nIn the 1940s George Gamow was joined by his students Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman in working out details of Friedmann’s solutions to Einstein’s theory. They expanded on Gamow’s idea that the universe expanded from a primordial state of matter called ylem consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons in a sea of radiation. They theorized the universe was very hot at the time of the big bang (the point at which the universe explosively expanded from its primordial state), since elements heavier than hydrogen can be formed only at a high temperature. Alpher and Hermann predicted that radiation from the big bang should still exist. Cosmic background radiation roughly corresponding to the temperature predicted by Gamow’s team was detected in the 1960s, further supporting the big ba"
"2","What is the physiological effect of cocaine on the brain?","I have read that the physiological effect of cocaine on the brain is similar to the physiological effect of eating or having sex.  Is this true and how does it work?","Cocaine produces a wide range of physiological effects in humans, including the stimulation of a plethora of emotional experiences. When people take cocaine, they become euphoric, highly active (locomotion, tremors, and tics), and more talkative than normal. They experience feelings of extreme power and alertness. This initial high is followed by bouts of severe anxiety, paranoia, and depression, which often lead to addiction. Those who become addicted to the drug often turn the habit into an obsession, so that they devote more, and more of their time and money to acquiring and using the drug. \n\nWithdrawal from cocaine can cause a drastic fall in the level of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (Rosetti 1992). This decrease is thought to be caused by an increased secretion of dynorphin, one of the endogenous opioids.\n\nmore information in\nhttp://www.macalester.edu/psychology/whathap/UBNRP/Dopamine/cocaine.html\n\n \n(AP) Chronic cocaine use harms brain circuits that help produce the sense of pleasure, which may help explain why cocaine addicts have a higher rate of depression, a study suggests \nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/01/health/main534934.shtml"

"1","How can we trust God's ability to judge, if He doesn't even see the difference between various sins ?","If i don't kill my brother, but i say that i did, then i commit the sin of lying\nif i kill my brother, then i commit the sin of murder.\n\nTo God they are equally bad. Any sane creature knows they are are not equaly bad. How can i trust His ability to judge me?","Fantastic question!  Take the Christian belief that each of the 10 commandments are all equally as bad as the other and that all you have to do to get to heaven is repent for all of these sins.  That would mean that if people like Charles Manson on their death bed simply prayed for forgiveness and truly felt that what they did was wrong, then he would go to heaven.  Yet if a person disliked their parents who beat them and called the police, got them thrown in jail and never had contact with them again, even if the parents tried to apologize, and the person never felt bad about it, they would be denied entry into heaven because they weren't sorry or repentant for breaking the commandment of ""Honor thy Father and thy Mother...""  This, by the way, is the same god that a good chunk of Christians believe will not allow a child into heaven if the parents did not have him/her baptized.  I think at some point we have to ask ourselves if there is a God, is he simply ticked off that somewhere, someone made up rules and stories of things they claim he said to do and that to this day millions of people hold those beliefs and spread them, that perhaps he's allowing the world to suffer a bit to get them to stop being sheep, following blindly, spreading hate and intolerance for others (I'm talking here about those like the ""Christians"" who protest at private funerals for our millitary personnel killed in Iraq by saying that God is punishing us for allowing homosexuality).  \n\nThink about this:  The 21st ecumenical council was announced by Pope John XXIII on January 25, 1959.  This council said that \nit was acceptable for woman to pursue pastorate positions because there was a shortage of priests at the time. Many parishes then allowed female pastorates and they rapidly gained popularity. However in 1994, the Pope John Paul II wrote a letter of decree banning further talk of ordaining women as priests.   Many women took demotions to comply with the writings of one man, who with one letter simply changed what had been acceptable for nearly 40 years.  \n\nHistory is full of ""rules"" that have changed in the Roman Catholic church, simply on the whim of the Pope and changing societal beliefs.  Who knows, next thing, maybe there will be degrees of heaven and hell and we'll all have to pay money to improve our lot in life.  In that case, the consequences for lying might be 3 hours a day in hell, the rest in heaven....\n\nSo, I'm thinking if there is a God, he's just ticked off that everyone is missing the basic message of be good to each other and do your best to be a good person.  And until people stop interpreting supposed facts and happenings in ways that suit them at the time, we're all in big trouble."

We do know that all human fetuses begin development as females, and only become male when they are exposed to male hormones while they develop.  Ovaries and testes are initially the same structure, but they develop into different things based upon the fetus' genes.  If they develop into testes, the fetus starts producing testosterone.  This also determines whether another structure develops into a penis or a clitoris, and my guess is that it also determines whether breast tissue becomes enlarged and develops milk-producing tissue.  So my short answer is, men have teats because for a little while in the womb, they were actually women.  Isn't it strange how our bodies work?"
"1","What makes a nation? What makes Canada a nation? What are the specific requirements to be a nation?","","A nation is not confined by boundaries.  A state is.  A group or a state is considered a nation when its citizens feel bound by a sense of nationalism.  The U.S. is made up of an amalgam of different races, but we all consider ourselves to be Americans and are bound together by that.  A group of people or an area do not have to be a state in order to be a nation."

"3","Here's a gross period question for the ladies....?","What are the chunks that come out during a period?  Are they blood clots or uterus lining or what?  I know so little about my own anatomy its ridiculous.","My gynecologist explains clots to me as follows: Blood is pushed out of your uterus when the uterus contracts (you don't necessarily feel these contractions, but when they are strong, you feel them as cramps). The uterus releases ""anti-coagulants"" during menstruation. These are supposed to keep the blood from clotting up as it passes from the uterus to the vagina, thus making the whole bleeding process easier.\n\nBut if you have days of heavy cramps and heavy bleeding, you may pass dark, chunky clots of blood. On such days your contractions are so fast and so strong that the blood gets forced out before the anti-coagulants have time to take effect. So the blood clots. And you pass big chunky gobs of stuff.\n\nIf the clots you are passing are larger than, say, a quarter, you might want to ask your doctor about it, because that indicates that your periods are quite heavy, and they might want to check for fibroids (benign tumors)."

"1","Who Knows what Hell is Biblically? verses are nice?","1 Thes 4:15 says we sleep till resurection and the dead in Jesus rise first\nwe get lots of questions on this each day","If one looks at the original texts of the Bible (in Greek), the word ""Hell"" NEVER appears. In some places it says ""Gehenna"" or ""the valley of the son of Hinnom"" which is an actual place ON Earth; a place where people of Israel were actually burned. Jesus only spoke of this place metaphorically,in parables. The other way ""hell"" was translated was from the word ""tartaros,"" which is Greek, or ""Sheol"", which is Hebrew. Both meaning ""the grave.""  The souls of everyone go to Sheol where they rest until the day of Judgment.  No reference to fire and eternal punishment after death in either of this translations.\n\nWhen the Bible talks about the Lake of Fire (which is NOT Hell), everyone thinks pain and suffering. But the in Semitic Middle East, fire is a symbol of GOD. Jesus said ""He came to send fire on the earth and He yearned for it to be kindled."" (Luke 12:49)\nObviously he is talking about fire in the sense of God, not suffering. Moreover, when the Bible talks about the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, the word ""Brimstone"" is translated from the word ""Theion"" which means ""Divine."" So in other words the ""Lake of fire and Brimstone"" should really translate into ""Lake of Divine Purification""  This is not where man is destroyed, but his sin is destroyed."

Everything feels like it's crashing down around me, especially with my parents always b*()ing at me for every little thing and my mother sorting through everything in my room to ""clean"" it. What should I do to escape this...or is there an escape?","Here are some pro-active things you can do. Hope this helps!\n\n""GET OUT OF BED: \n\nOne of the most important things you can do is get up at about the same time every morning (even week-ends). Preferably, that means about 7 a.m. or earlier. You might not feel like it but Get Up. Such regularity helps your body function more normally so you're more likely to feel normal. \n\nLIGHTS: \n\nLight helps your body function better. So turn on a lot of lights as soon as you arise. Open curtains to get more sunlight. Better yet, go outdoors into the sunshine as soon as you can. Remove any eyewear so light will enter more readily (glass cuts out some of the sun's rays). But don't stare at the sun, of course. \n\nMOVE: \n\nBe active right away -- oxygenate! That means getting up and walking around your dwelling for five or 10 minutes, or perhaps riding an exercycle. Mild exercise gets the blood flowing and transports more oxygen throughout your body (especially to your brain), helping you feel mentally alert and alive. \n\nMUSIC: \n\nSelect and play some energetic, happy music as you dress and have your breakfast. The audiovisual department of most libraries has albums and tapes you can check out. \n  \n\nBREAKFAST: \n\nBegin your breakfast with protein (i.e., meat, eggs, peanut butter, nuts, cheese). When you get up, your body chemistry is ready to convert food, especially protein,into longlasting energy. To balance your most important meal of the day, add an orange or other fresh fruit and whole grain cereal or whole grain bread. \n\nTALK WITH SOMEONE: \n\nOne of the quickest ways to beat the blues is to interact with others. You might not feel like doing that - you'd rather avoid people when blue. So make lt easier on yourself. Talk with someone you enjoy about a subject you enjoy so there is definite give and take. \n\nAnd, force yourself to say ""hello"" to the persons next to you in class, those where you live, anyone around. \n\nLIMIT CAFFEINE: \n\nThe long-term (four hours or so) effects of caffeine are depression. Try to limit coffee to no more than one cup in the morning. Coffee can make you more alert for an hour or so, but later you get an opposite reaction. Caffeine tends to increase the release of insulin in the blood, and insulin lowers the blood sugar level. When you have low blood sugar levels, you begin to feel less sure of yourself, and have low energy levels, which can lead to the blues or depression. \n\nLIMIT SUGAR: \n\nSugar might give you an initial rush of energy, but within an hour or so the blood sugar level can become low, and when it's low you may feel low, too. \n\nThe caffeine/sugar cycle. It's easy to get caught in the caffeine and sugar cycle -- having coffee, caffeinated soft drinks, or something with sugar every two hours or so to ""stay up."" For example, cola contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar plus caffeine equal to about half a cup of coffee. In addition to bringing on the blues, this cycle can result in dependence, poor nutrition. and obesity -- reasons to get down on yourself even more and feel blue. \n\nMAINTAIN FIBER: \n\nFiber helps food go through your digestive system at a proper rate, giving a more constant energy supply. Highly processed foods merely provide a quick surge of energy which can be followed by depression. You can maintain fiber in your diet by eating an orange or grapefruit rather than just drinking the juice. Eat fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grain breads and cereals. \n\nSTRESS B COMPLEX: \n\nSome persons report receiving help by taking a concentrated vitamin B complex. You'll find these called something like ""Stress B"" or ""B 50."" This is controversial. \nSome nutritionists say, ""Yes, this really should be considered,"" and others say, ""No, this is not a good Idea."" You can try some and decide whether or not it helps you. If it does help, then perhaps you should consult a nutr"

"3","is it normal for a woman to squirt during sex?  if so what causes this only sometimes, not everytime?","","It's not normal for a woman to ""squirt"" vaginal fluid or urine during sex.  It is normal for a woman to ooze vaginal fluid from the ducts that are around the vaginal opening.\n\nIf there is squirting from the vagina, it could be just that the woman's ducts produce more than average, or it could be the sign of a vaginal infection.  Many women have bacterial infections and don't know it, and when the pustules burst or the ducts are already irritated, they will secrete with some pressure.\n\nAlso, a fairly common sexually transmitted disease called trichomoniasis will cause an extreme amount of discharge.\n\nIn the case of a bacterial infection, the secretions may be clear with whitish and yellowish streaks, or somewhat thin, or with traces of blood.  It might also be very smelly like when you pop an old zit in a soft place.\n\nIt might not be very smelly at all, but if there's blood in it, that's a clear sign of possible infection.\n\nWith trichomoniasis, the discharge may be thick and seem whipped and creamy because of the air bubbles in it from the parasites.  Also, when this discharge comes in contact with male ejaculate, it will have a distinctly fishy odor.  Some people think it will smell fishy on its own, but that's not the case.  It's the combination that gives off that tell tale aroma of sun ripened chum.\n\nTo know whether or not one's squirting is natural or because of a problem, a person who notices this should have regular std examinations.  If you're all clear then it's all good.  Enjoy it, and ""don't forget to bring a towel."""

It has also been linked to the fact that a lunisolar calendar must have 13 months in some years, while the solar Gregorian calendar and lunar Islamic calendar always have 12 months in a year. Another suggestion is that the belief originated in a Norse myth about twelve gods having a feast in Valhalla. The mischievous Loki gate-crashed the party as an uninvited 13th guest and arranged for Hod, the blind god of darkness, to throw a branch of mistletoe at Balder, the god of joy and gladness. Balder was killed instantly and the Earth was plunged into darkness and mourning as a result."

The idea is that you pass a fluid (either a gas or a liquid) down a long path, and the different molecules will move at different rates.  THat's the long and short of it.  So the molecules that move fastest get to the end first, and the slowest come out last.  You seperate things by making them race, and similar chemicals will take a similar amount of time to finish the race.\n\nI'm assuming that you're getting confused by things like ""solid phase"" and ""mobile phase"" and ""bind affinity"" and such.  The idea though is that you set up different types of obstacles depending on which things you want to win the race.  Sometimes this is dine by using something with a lot of positive charges, so that things with negative charges will get stuck and the things that are neutral or positively charged will win the race. Sometimes you sort things by size, by using a gel as an obstable with a bunch of little pores in it: little guys get lost inside and the fat guy wins the race.  With gases, you can just make the race really, really, really long, and the lightest parts will move the quickest while the hevy boys lag behind (this is a way that uranium is enriched for nuclear reactors and bombs)."

But what is funny is that sometimes that infection can be wiped out with something as simple as Amoxicillin or Bactrim, it just depends on what the culture says.  Anyway, infections are usually spread by dirty hands. But that's anywhere, not just the NICU.   That's the #1 way.  Coughing, sneezing, breathing, and touching are also ways of spreading infections.  Using the instant hand sanitizer is a good thing.  I use it all the time.  I hope I gave you some useful information!"

"3","how do we do an intervention for a morbidly obese individual?","","Believe me, the person already knows they are way too large. It is great that you care, but any pressure put on someone who is overweight will only make them feel worse and only keep them from losing weight. A lot of times it will actually stimulate them into putting on more weight. No matter how well meant, the best thing to do for an over weight person is to not bring up their weight, their looks or that they need to lose weight. They already know all that and no matter how well meant, pointing it out to them is only going to backfire and make things worse. All that is proven facts in studies done by medical doctors and also in the psychiatric community. Just love the person for who they are. Not what their body looks like. Understandably, there is great concern about their health, but an intervention is not going to help that. If an over weight person is not ready to lose weight (and it is a very hard thing to do, almost anyone who is not over weight can NOT begin to imagine how hard it is to lose weight and to ""diet"") plus if they do lose weight, it will not stay off. If it is done for anything but themselves, it will NOT work. And most times when it is done for themselves because they are ready, 98% of the people who lose weight will put it back on. People are not over weight due to being lazy or all the old sterio typical ideas. There is so much proof out there now it is from genetics, and lots of other medical reasons.

Help please!","Insect Bite\n\nWhen I get an insect bite, I use the homeopathic remedy Natrium Muriaticum, immediately. I use water or saliva to moisten the pill and distribute it on the bite. \n\nIf some time has elapsed before I get to the homeopathic pills, I use Ferrum Phosphoricum, because the body may have already reacted with an inflammation.\n\nFor swelling I use Dinshah Color MedicineTM, Dinshah color Indigo. Or, I take Kalium Muriaticum under my tongue, often at first, later less and less.\n\nFor the pain I take the homeopathic remedy Hypericum Perforatum. Also very often at first, under the tongue.\n\nYou have to decide if you should get a treatment by a professional. \n\nWishing you a speedy recovery.\n\nCordially, India.Magica"
"2","Was Earth smaller and Pangaea was the entire crust OR could Pangaea be where the Moon left Earth?","From plate tectonics we know the continents at one time formed a supercontinent (Pangaea).  However, there seems to be an assumption that the size of the Earth has remained relatively unchanged.  Otherwise we could conclude (in an extreme case) that Pangaea was the entire crust of the Earth and as the Earth expanded out Pangaea broke up. (??)\n\nIf Earth has remained roughly the same size, then it seems that if all continents were one that this is significant.  In other words, the location and existence of a supercontinent may indicate something of greater importance.  For example if the Moon was formed by a large meteor impact and flew away from Earth (as current theories indicate), then could the Moon have separated from Earth at the location of Pangaea???","Nice idea.... but there is a BIG hole in your theory:\n\nThe moon broke off from the earth somewhere between 3.5 and 4.5 billion years ago.... i.e. the Hadean... the more specific name for the earlier Precambrian.\n\nPangaea didn't even begin moving together until 1.1 billion years ago, and wasn't together as one continent until about 500 million years ago.... during the Permian.\n\nOh... and tectonic plate movement is a result of thermal flows in the mantle.\n\nPangaea has nothing to do with the moon, sorry to say."

"2","how long did it take for humans to develop?","","Where and when did human civilization begin? The origin of human civilization is a great mystery presently clouded by the myths of historians. A date is half-heartedly pointed to, 8000 BC, referring to Sumeria, which is only ten thousand years ago. Actually, our modern historians are like the chickadees, which live only for one day and cannot journey outside of that narrow framework. Putting a ten thousand-year cap on human civilization is cramping an ancient, far-reaching heritage into a little box. All human civilization has come from a universal source, whose pre-eminence antedates Sumeria by tens of thousands of years. Like a puzzle, the ancient records and traditions of the offspring cultures can piece this remarkable civilization's illustrious origins, growth, and decay together. Secondly, the cutting edge of archaeological research is proving beyond the shadow of a doubt the existence of the original source of all human civilization. With all of this evidence resurfacing from the depths of time, human history is about to be rewritten."

"1","Do you believe you can be delivered from physical pain?","Many of us have lived relatively easy lives. And think it would be unjust for\nGod to let us suffer a while, since we are believers. But the Word makes it clear\nthere will be some suffering.\nAnd those who ""die"" in Christ will be raised first, and together with those who\nare alive, will be caught up together with the Lord!""\n I had a freind who got electrocuted on a construction job. He said his\nspirit jumped out, and he watched himself getting shocked.\nAn African woman spoke one time and said she was getting beaten for her\nfaith. But God took her spirit out of her, and she watched herself being\nbeaten, and was spared most of the pain.\nDo you believe God can do that for you? Or will we get angry when the\nsuffering comes and curse God?","Dear Solomon R.:  I DO believe God through his Greatest Teacher and the Partnership of the Holy Spirit CAN do that for us.\n\nI am a Christian and Spiritually oriented person.  My path is alive through ""tight"" relationships with both the Holy Spirit and Jesus.  Many do not know. . ., but Jesus and the Holy Spirit can and DO teach something non-traditional religions have named Transcendence.\n\nWill you bear with me, if I expand a picture for you to look upon and possibly contemplate?\n\nThe Crucifixion is looked upon as physical torture - to the degree that we have to turn away, and hold on to ourselves.  Many learn to love Him by witnessing the pain aspect.  Some love Him without dwelling upon it.  The meaning of the Crucifixion is far greater than the seeming display of physical vulnerability and pain:  Our vulnerability to each other and to our bodies.\n\nThe Crucifixion was undertaken by Him as the greatest learning tool He could use and teach by.  After the people saw  the ultimate physical abuse taking place - to an extent that leads to death - He then offered the Final Statement:  What God Created. . . cannot be destroyed.  The physical is perishable, but not what God Created.  Notice. . .He reappeared in his physical image again, and remained in it until He desired to leave.  Note:  The physical image he appeared in contained a ""hole"" for the others to see, but the blood, the bruising, the torn and tattered flesh were all absent !\n\nInside of us, and coupled with our human Intellect is a thing called soul or spirit.  Jesus and the Holy Spirit teach how to live through that - more than through the logic of the Intellect.  They both SERVE us in this physical life - the Intellect and the Soul.\n\nJesus can also TEACH how to use our God-given soul or Spirit-Mind to block out or transcend the pains of the physical.  He willingly teaches that WE ARE NOT VULNERABLE ;  to each other, or to the human Intellect !  Not all of us become Masters as He did and master life.  But, Jesus can teach level upon level of God's Thoughts and Knowledge to us - IF we choose to learn it, and ask for that.  \n\nPresently, I am working on that very thing.  Transcendence and Detachment.  To do this, you must have something to ""go up against.""  Something to test against.  I have experienced the inflictions of physical pain - and, according to His instruction, through my Mind, have learned to ""banish"" it.  Many, many of us have learned this.  Ghandi spoke of the horrifying beatings he received at the hands of his opposers.  He was taken to the hospital more than once so bruised, bloodied and purpled that it was not understood how he bore the pain.  He said, that although the body showed the infliction - he did not FEEL it !  We have no idea how powerful our souls or spirit-minds are.  And the joy of tapping into its power.  Many non-notable people, as you have mentioned, and now me too (!) have experienced the gifts of Spirit and some degree of Mastery over the physical.  It's real.\n\nWhen we are taught that after Ascension Jesus rose to rest and sit at the right hand of God and is no longer teaching on earth - we should be aware that there is a slight mis-perception in that.  He DID go before our Creator.  He was allowed to ""speak"" with Him.  But, He was quickly placed in charge of the Sonship and ceaselessly and intensely teaches us through Mind-to-Mind.  We receive His tutoring when we invite Him and then learn to hear his voice through our mind.  \n\nThe Sons of Man (Us) are much more. . .than we appear to be.  Something else Created our Minds.\n\nBest regards, Lana"

Please help me in solving ALL these problems!! It would really help me in completing this 200 problem WRKSHT!! If I know how to do each of these problem, i could do the RESt!!","Switch your calculator from degrees (DEG) to radians (RAD). That should do the trick. \nHere are some quick trig rules you need to know:\nIn radians just remember that pi is 180 degrees. Pi/3 is 60 degrees, pi/2 is 90, pi/4 is 45 degrees and so on. \nIn a unit circle, the hypotenuse is always 1.\nSin is always the far side away from the angle (the vertical side). We call that the opposite side.\nCos is always the adjacent side (or horizontal side).\nIn a right triangle with angles 60 and 30, the shortest side is always 1/2 the hypotenuse, so in a unit triangle, it is just 1/2. You can use the pathagorean theorem to find that the longer side is the square root of (3/4), or (sqrt(3))/2.\nIn a right triangle with angles 45 and 45, the opposite and adjacent sides are equal, and we can use the pathagorean theorem to find that the sides are the square root of (1/2), or 1/(sqrt(2)).\n\n1. Sin 1/3 pi. This is the same as sin pi/3 which is a 60 degree angle. If you draw the triangle on a unit circle you would see that the opposite side is the longer side of a 90/60/30 triangle. We have seen above that the length is (sqrt(3))/2.\n\n2. Cos pi. Easy. pi is 180 degrees, so draw the unit circle. You see that it is just a striaght horizontal line going the other way so the answer is -1.\n\n3. cos pi/4 is a 45 degree angle. We know from above that both sides have to be 1/(sqrt(2)).\n\n4. sin pi/4. Same as #3.\n\n27. What is 315 degrees? Well draw your unit circle. Go, 90, then to 180, then to 270, then go 45 more degrees and you will end up at 315 degrees. Draw your triangle. We know that the hypotenuse is 1, so the coordinates will simply be, (cos 315, sin 315). Cos 315 is just a 90/45/45 triangle in the bottom right quadrant so the adjacent side is positive. The opposite is negative, so you end up with coordinates (1/(sqrt(2)), -1/(sqrt(2))). Do the same to solve the last question youeself."

I think once the cost to society, where corporate healthcare and government healthcare costs are increased substantially, are fully accounted for, people who are educated will come to understand that smoking should be banned in the United States all together.  There are simply no benefits to this drug for society and only substantial costs, suffering, both directly and through second-hand, that make smoking an antiquated behavior.  The CDC shows that as one's education level increases, the rate of use decreases.  So this drug simply preys on the uninformed and should be outlawed.  A 5 year plan to allow smokers ample time to quit followed by the erradication of production of tobacco would be the way to get rid of this epic problem.  Why should someone else have to pay for another's bad, adult decision to begin smoking?  Should someone who works for a company with a shared healthcare plan for its employees have to pay the increased premiums do to the neccessary treatments for directly-linked cancers associated with smoking?  I think not. At some point, the American government found marijuana, cocaine, and acid to be a detriment to society and passed laws to get rid of them.  Tobacco is even worse in some ways, because second hand smoke causes cancer, certainly not a fair state of life for children or other people.

You are going to be the earth so you stand in the center where the giant stick pin of the compass went. Pick a friend to be the moon. She is going to walk along the path of the  circle and you are going to face her at all times and observe carefully what you see. First have her look in one direction as she marches along the path - like maybe looking at the school building or maybe facing north. Make sure her entire body faces the same way at all times. In other words, she moves in a circle but does not rotate her body. Notice that you see her from the front at times, then the left side, back, right and front again. Now. Compare this to the moon. If the moon didn't rotate we would see all sides of it during the course of its almost one month journey around the earth. In other words, if the moon did NOT rotate we WOULD be able to see the back side.  Now, have your friend do the same as before but this time have her face you at all times so you cannot see her back - only her front . Now. Ask her what she saw in addition to you and she will say that part of the time she saw the school house and part of the time she was even facing away from it and finally ended up facing the school again. She faced first north, then east, then south, then west and finally north again. In other words, she turned in a complete circle while her face was turned toward you at all times. This is what the moon does. One face of the moon is turned toward the earth at all times. In order for that to be true it must rotate, just like your friend. The secret is that it rotates on its axis at the exact same speed as it revolves in its path about the earth. The reason for this behavior is that the moon is captured by the earth's gravity."

"2","what the heck is that big black cloud on 'LOST'?","","The only time we've seen the monster it's been a smoky, black cloud-looking thing.\n\nMost of these times, it's been from Eko's point of view, but we've also seen it with Jack (and I think Kate) back when they were investigating the Black Rock slave ship in the jungle, and we've seen it from Charlie's point of view when Eko stared it down.\n\nOnly Locke appears to view it differently, but it's quite possible that he's even more insane than Hurley.  \n\nIn some scenes, it appears to have indistinct human faces swirling in the midst of the cloud.  In which case, it might be involved in the appearances of other people (i.e. Jack's Dad, Boone, Eko's brother, Hurley's imaginary friend, Kate's horse) on the island.  Perhaps it is telepathic/empathic, and is able to draw on the memories of the castaways and project itself accordingly.\n\nThere is a mention on the glowy map on the back of the hatch door that Locke saw of some sort of 'electromagnetic anomaly' called Cerberus running amok in the vicinity of the original hatch.  Cerberus was the three-headed dog that guarded the gates to the underworld in Greek mythology, and it would seem to be an appropriate name for the phenomenon as we have seen so far.\n\nMy personal theory is that the writers of the show don't actually have any idea what the monster is, or why the Others are doing what they do, or any real answers to anything on the show, and are just making it up as they go along.  They're hoping that they can pull a 'tada' explanation out of their bums at some point that they claim will answer all the questions, but I'm betting that their explanation won't be logical, and won't be consistent with everything we've seen because it will have been fabricated the week before.\n\nI'm hoping I'm wrong, but I haven't seen anything in the last three seasons that actually gives me hope that they really have a well-thought out, coherent and plausible explanation that they are slowly unveiling.  It all seems random, and fabricated from whole-cloth.  Perhaps they will prove me wrong, and this will all turn out better than, say, the X-Files did.  But I'm not holding my breath.\n\nThe only reason I continue to watch is that many of the characters are incredibly interesting.  Sadly, this season they've done next to nothing with either Sayid or Hurley, killed off the best character on the show (Mr. Eko), and had waaaay too much focus on boring Jack.\n\nAnd although Benry is pretty cool as a villain, I'm finding it harder and harder to find his treatment of the castaways as even vaguely rational or believable.  Why would he essentially sit there pulling the wings off of flies when he could have easily won their undying respect, admiration and loyalty by just showing up on the beach the very first day with a big-old first aid kit and some fish biscuits??"

I've used Dessert Essence Tea Tree face wash, Zihr, Nivea Q10, Loreal Men's hydrosomething or other... I just need ONE good facial cleanser and moisturizer that is effective and doesn't clog pores. Any recommendations?","It really depends on your skin type. Are you oily, dry or a combination of the two? \n\nI find Zirh's facial cleanser and facial scrub to be excellent at getting your skin clean and bright. \n\nBy far the most important thing is the moisturise at least once a day (morning is a must). If you've got oily skin and you use a moisturiser that's too heavy, then your skin will look greasy and shiny. It works the same way for dry skin, if your moisturiser is too light then it just won't work and your skin will still be dry.\n\nI have combination skin and find that the only thing that works for me is an oil-free moisturiser by 'Anthony'. When I'm hungover or really tired then Boitherm's Aquaforce or Nickel's Morning After are brilliant for making you look better than you feel!\n\nFor ultra smooth/soft skin use a clay or mud mask every couple of weeks. This will get deep into the pores of your skin and get rid of all those impurities. All the major brands make these!\n\nHappy skin."

"2","How, the  sound is produced when we tear the Papers.if it due to molecular collision,why not in Polythene pprs","","it's got two aspects to it- thw molecular make up (natural cellulose and synthetic polymers) but the easiest explaination is this-\n\n    when u tear paper, the bonds break and molecular collision takes place. all this creates energy which is dissapated as sound energy (tearing sound)\n     wheras when you try to tear plastic, you will find that instead of simply tearing up, plastic paper stretches. this is because it is made of synthetic polymeric reactions. so, the energy which is released is not released in the form of sound energy, but it is released as heat. you will note when you try ti tear plastis sheets that it will first stretch, become warm and then kind of 'pull away' from the bulk sheet."

"1","What do people think about the animal rights movement and the treatment of animals world wide?","We abuse animals on a daily basis without giving much thought to it. In the Western world, largely due to a reference in the Bible which proclaims man's dominion over all, we continue to deny connections to other sentient beings, abusing them for food, entertainment and in the pursuit for ""better medicines"" (more than half of all tests performed are unwarranted and unnecessary, achieving the same results as prior experiments, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)--- in short, unnecessary cruelty.","I think the Native Americans  were on to a good thing before the Europeans showed up. They killed animals for food and clothing. They respected the animals as brothers who shared this planet. Nothing was left to waste. \n\nI feel that the animal rights movement is a good one as corporate giants would utterly disrespect animals (and the planet) for profit. I also feel that some organizations go too far in promoting the respectful treatment of animals. Some times to the detriment of the whole movement.\n\nWe are in a symbiosis with the animals of this planet if they disappear how long before we disappear?"

You might want to check with your source and see if that is the word they were talking about.\n\nWhether surgury is needed for a particular person's case is something only a trained medical doctor can answer.  Only a licensed, trained medical person can perform surgery too.\n\nThere is more than one type of fissure.  Since you did not give specifics of what part of the body is involved, I am including a Wikipedia link that lists a lot of different kinds of fissures.\n\nThere are other treaments besides surgury for fissures.  From the material published online, it does sound like they do require treatment but the treatment is not always surgery.  Some treatments sound very simple and very non-traumatic, in fact.\n\nI recommend reading all of the Sources I have listed.  They will probably do much to set your mind at ease and explain what a fissure is and ways they can be treated.  Afterwards you will probably have a better idea what courses of treatment are available."

"1","Is it ok to refer to a woman as a broad? a chick? What about a broad chick?","","Broad, no.  For some reason this carries with it the implication of either bitchy or stupid.\n\nChick, sure.  Implies cute or girly and adapts well to all kinds of adjectives.  (i.e. hot chick, dumb chick, touch chick, etc)\n\nAnd really ""broad chick"" is way too intellectual an insult from a man who would call a girl a chick, and too informal for one attempting political correctness.  Might as well cut to the chase and say ""fat chick""."
"2","Which nucleic acid ultimately determines which proteins will be produced?","","Listen carefully and ignor anyone who tells you diffrently. All the informaton needed for every protien in the body is stored as DNA. When a particular protien is needed, the streatch of DNA that codes for it is copied into RNA. THis piece of RNA is called a transcript. \n\nThe transcript is usually proccessed in the cell before being sent to the ribosom. There the ribosom reads the nucleic acids in groups of three. So no one nucleic acid makes a protien, but three nucleic acids determine one amino acid. A string of amino acids makes up a protien."

"3","i took preg test & it was + so i took 2 more and they were - and i hav irreg periods could i still be preg?","","Pregnancy tests (even the ones done at home)  are rarely wrong if they are positive.  In rare cases, a hormonal imbalance can cause it to turn positive, however the urine tests are looking for a hormone that the body makes during pregnancy.  If it is there, the test will be positive.  If the hormone is not there, the test is negative.  Having irregular periods means that you probably have some kind of hormonal problems, but it does not mean that you cannot be pregnant.  If you have taken a pregnancy test and it is positive, GO TO THE DOCTOR!  Good Luck!"

Begin to collect an archive of various music genres that you can resolve one day to enjoy after you get the rest of your chores done.\nBetty, if after following my advice, simply take two aspirin and forget we ever had this little discussion.\nThank you, Betty. Have a great day!\nDr.Justin"

"3","what are the benefits of using nitric oxide in bodybuilding?","","Lol, swaps_81 is reading another book different subect.\n\nNitric Oxide does not give many long term benefits from what i have see, you will get great pump while working out with it becuase it is mainly vascular in that i will relax your veins allowing more blood to pump through your system but i do not think it will give you any real long term gains. Also, i got a week feeling when using it such as when you drink to much caffien.\n\nGive it a try and can not hurt you unless you are refering to the same kind of nitric oxide that swaps_81 is refering too"
"2","At what temperature does copper become malleable?","","Copper is malleable any temperature above about -50C..certainly at room temperature, so I'm not sure what you mean by that question- It has a relatively high melting point (about 1100 C), but does not need to be hot to be worked."

"3","How can my cat and allergic boyfriend coexist?","","Most people are allergic to cats because of the oils that are produced by the cat's hair. It is a known fact that washing a cat's hair for several weeks will actually allow the fur coat to stop producing these oils. This happens because when you wash a cat, the oils are stripped from the coat, and eventually the coat just stops producing them (this doesn't hurt the cat in any way).\n\nOf course, the trick is getting your cat into the bath tub.\n\nI am allergic to cats but have owned two cats for the last five years. I don't take any medications, but if a cat hair touches my face, my eyes will flare up and it'll look like I'm crying. This is why I keep eye drops handy."
"3","I've been on the pill for 12 years, & have 7 sets of twins in my family, does that increase my chances 4 twins","","Taking the birth control pill has no bearing on twins.  Studies show that there is a genetic basis for fraternal twinning. However, it is only the female partner that has any influence on the chances of having fraternal twins as the male cannot make her release more than one ovum. The likelihood of a single fertilisation resulting in identical twins is not a hereditary trait. The exact cause for the splitting of a zygote or embryo is unknown."

"2","At the equator, is every day exactly 12 hours of daylight? And are sunrise and sunset always the same time?","","The earth's orbit is not circular so at some times of the year the earth is travelling more quickly. So sunrise and sunset times vary at the equator. In fact the earliest sunset is at the middle of November and the latest sunrise is at the begining of February. In temperate regions this effect is overwhelmed by the effects due to the tilt of the earths axis."
"2","What is Electromagnetic Wave Theory?","","Electromagnetic radiation is a propagating wave in space with electric and magnetic components. These components oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation.\n\nThe term electromagnetic radiation is also used as a synonym for electromagnetic waves in general, even if they are not radiating or travelling in free space. This sense includes, for example, light travelling through an optical fiber, or electrical energy travelling within a coaxial cable.\n\nElectromagnetic (EM) radiation carries energy and momentum which may be imparted when it interacts with matter."

I have the utmost respect for anyone who has done this, no matter what beliefs they settle on afterwards."

I would like to use the 45 minute commute to and from work every day to learn a new language with the Pimsleur Approach. I want to try Chinese. Is there anyone out there without a Chinese background who learned to speak Chinese successfully, and which dialect is the most common nowadays (Cantonese or Mandarin)?  I could always pick up French, which I took a semester of in college, but I feel that I will have less of a chance to use it since more of the world population is speaking Chinese than French (and I think it Cantonese Chinese).  Apologies for making this so long.","Well I lived in hong kong for a month and people there speak cantonese for their daily life, but almost all the people speak mandarin because its mandatory in most of the schools to learn it so its better if you learn mandarin, cantonese is harder.\nAs for french, its my 3rd language and I gotta tell you once you know spanish, french is a piece of cake , so go for french I say , french is also wide spoken, once you learn it I'll say go for mandarin."

"2","starting with events at the neuromuscular junction and ending with a contracted muscle?","","The impulse reaches the terminal end of the motor neuron and breaks open the synaptic vesicles, releasing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft.\nACh then binds to receptor molecules in the motor end plate of the muscle fiber.\nThe action potential is started in sarcolemma and passes along the membrane until it reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum releasing calcium. Calcium diffuses in sarcoplasm and binds to the troponin in the thin filaments.\nThe binding sites on the actin molecules are freed, allowing\nthe heads of myosin (thick filaments) to attach on the binding sites forming the cross-bridges connections.\nThe cross-bridges shift their angle causing the thin filaments to slide over the thick filaments; this produces the contraction.\n ATP is needed for the last step. ATP is bound to myosin; calcium activates ATP breakdown into ADP and phosphate.\nPart of the energy produced is used to move bridges, the other part is released as heat, increasing the body temperature.\nMore ATP breaks the bond between thick and thin filaments in the cross bridge; calcium returns to thesarcoplasmic reticulum and the thin filaments return to their original position, closing off the binding site to cross bridges and causing the muscle to relaxe."
"1","Why is it so hard to say you're wrong?","","It's hard to say your wrong due to stubborness and not wanting to actually admit any mistakes on our part.  Even when we know we are wrong, we want some type of right to come out.  Guilt, fear, and low self-esteem can contribute into making things hard for us to admit when we are wrong."

Instead we use a probability function that does a good job.\n\nFor example -- we don't fully understand/mesaure all the variables that cause an earthquake. so we use probability distribution. the fact that this probablity method does not give an accurate prediction (at all!) is another topic.\n\nSo similarly why can't we use the same arguement for the electron?\n\nhow do quantum mechanics ""experts/scientists"" prove this hypothesis (hidden variable) wrong....in layman terms?","im not sure if i know what youre asking. but from what i understand from my QM class, for question 1 youre right. as in the double slit experiment. when they shot electrons at it, there was a wave pattern on the screen but when they watched the slitz there wasnt. the whole thing behind this is tht by watching it, they changed somethin in the situation and cause it to be just a particle pattern. so in theory if there was an infinitely efficient watcher, then thye could see that the elctron goes through both slits and makes a wave.\nthe 2nd question, the whole theory about quantum mechanics is that nothing is definite. its a probability distribution for everything. but just some items   have a 100% probability of being in 1 spot. as in say you have a pen in your hand   then the pen has a 100% probability of being in your hand and 0% everywhere else. but for an electron, you cant see it and since it wont stop moving  there is a different probability for it. theres a probability of say 40% of the electron being over there and 60% of it being here. or somethin. and i dont know what the earthquake thing meant. but i guess the probability distribution they calculated did a really bad job and the QM probability theory could also have done a really really bad job but nobody would know since electrons cant be measured yet (i think)"

"3","Why do I have knee pain six months after arthroscopic surgery?","","Well, it could be for a number of reasons. Depending on what you had done, it could be just as bad as it was before surgery. I myself have had 4 knee surgeries, 2 on each knee. They did debridement under the kneecaps, removal of torn meniscus, and lateral releases on both. The cartilage under my kneecaps is just as bad as before, because the problem has not been fixed. The debridement was a temporary relief of the damaged cartilage, but the problem is that my knee caps are not tracking right, so there is grinding and rubbing on my leg bones. This is very painful, somedays are worse than others. Also, the scar tissue from surgery causes pain, as well as the muscles that did not recover. I went through a pain management clinic, and they say that after surgery, the problem can be fixed, but the nerves that are used to sending the pain signals become used to doing that. So this is where chronic pain comes in. About the only thing you can do for chronic pain, is learn how to manage it. I take ibuprofen when my knees act up, and I use aspercreme if they get really achy. Other than that, it's either more surgery or learn to live with it. For me, they want to do more invasive surgery that involves breaking and resetting bones with screws to line the kneecaps where they should be, but I'm still not sure if I want to do this, as it might cause more problems than I already have. Well, I hope this helps in some way. I feel your pain. Good luck."

It is quite normal for children on his age to have difficulty with some sound combinations and some letters- particularly those formed only with variations of tongue and teeth.  The letters l, y, d, t, qu, k and g are sometimes a challenge.  So in a way, he is correct, it is partially the fault of his teeth.  You can help him learn to pronounce the letters by actually thinking about how you form the sounds and trying to explain it to him- as to where to put his teeth and tongue.  Otherwise, just relax.  He will improve with practice and time.  Most of them do.  Just don't stress him over it, just repeat the word back as it should be said and let it go.\n  Incidently, the problem exists in all languages.  It's called toddler speak, and is usually understood best and only by native speakers.

Yes, just about every faith known to man has had issues throughout history, but we can't beat the same old dead horse and keep bringing them up. If all we've learned from that is how to place guilt squarely on the shoulders of the other guy, we're really missing the point."

"2","Why an electron can not be found inside the nucleus?","","To understand why an electron doesn't crash into the nucleus of an atom you first have to understand Heisenberg's uncertainty principle:  That it is impossible to know with absolute certainty both the location and momentum of a particle.  Any attempt to observe the location of the particle will change its momentum and vice versa.  This is the principle concept of quantum physics.  Like Einstein's description of light, this defies all logic in Newtonian physics, but it has been repeatedly proven nonetheless.  For now, just accept it.\n\nAn electron must stay a certain distance (or multiple of a certain distance) from the nucleus because it if it were within that distance we would know its location in relation to the nucleus with such certainty that its momentum would become extremely large, causing it to fly away from the nucleus.  Therefore any time we observe an atom it MUST be located a minimum distance from the nucleus which is always a multiple of Planck's constant h [6.626068x10^-34 (m^2)kg/s]."

Matthew 21:43  Can we, the church,  who received it be in the same danger? Why or why not? (take heed lest you fall)","We as individuals can lose salvation and local churches can fall into apostasy (fall from favor). The church that was established in the 1st Century has never totally disappeared from the earth. As you read the New Testament though, you see that false teachers were already popping up in the church and leading many astray to be lost in eternal damnation.

They do not have any book of creeds or doctrines. The Bible is their only guide. If you want to learn more, please feel free to contact me."
"3","Have u ever heard of a ""heat phobia""?","i am afraid of getting overheated as i dont perspire and have had heat-exhaustion several times in my life, any suggestions? ty","What is Heat Phobia?\n\nDefined as ""heat"", each year this surprisingly common phobia causes countless people needless distress. \nKnown by a number of names - Thermophobia and Fear of Heat being the most common - the problem often significantly impacts the quality of life. It can cause panic attacks and keep people apart from loved ones and business associates. Symptoms typically include shortness of breath, rapid breathing, irregular heartbeat, sweating, nausea, and overall feelings of dread, although everyone experiences heat phobia in their own way and may have different symptoms.\n\n\nWhat is the cause of Heat Phobia?\n\nLike all fears and phobias, heat phobia is created by the unconscious mind as a protective mechanism. At some point in your past, there was likely an event linking heat and emotional trauma. Whilst the original catalyst may have been a real-life scare of some kind, the condition can also be triggered by myriad, benign events like movies, TV, or perhaps seeing someone else experience trauma\n\nThe best way to live with a phobia, is to ignore it. I know that is easier said than done, but the more you think about (say) your fear of being sick - the more fear and anxiety you create, the worse your phobia will become.\n\n\nThere are also therapies and drugs and things. Just try to relax, and remember that you arent alone."

If current ideas about the origin of large-scale structure are correct, then the detailed structure of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations will depend on the current density of the universe, the composition of the universe and its expansion rate. WMAP has been able to determine these parameters with an accuracy of better than 5%. Thus, we can estimate the expansion age of the universe to better than 5%. When we combine the WMAP data with complimentary observations from other CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), we are able to determine an age for the universe closer to an accuracy of 1%."

"1","why are marines called jarheads?","","JUGHEAD originally meant mule. ‘Jughead’ dates back to the late 19th century when it meant fool and by the 1910’s it had come to be a general term of abuse and also referred to a mule whose large chunky head denoted stubbornness and stupidity.\n\nJARHEAD started out as meaning mule probably ultimately from the pronunciation of ‘jawhead.’ In 1899 the mule became the mascot of the Army football team (to counteract the Navy goat) which could have had something to do with the military relationship. Of course a military icon wouldn’t have been picked for its stupidity so it is said that it was chosen as the mascot because ‘it reflects the long-standing usefulness of the animal in military operations -- hauling weapons, ammunition, and supplies. Strong, hearty, and persevering, the mule is truly an appropriate symbol for the Corps of Cadets.’ There are those who think that the term ‘leatherneck comes from the idea of the neck of the mule, but that term actually derives from the leather-lined collar which was formerly part of the uniform (1910-15).\n\nJarhead and jughead eventually merged to become slang synonyms for marine. Jughead was originally used to refer to members of a machine-gun company in WWI (‘the JUGHEAD gunners had it off the tripod and were tapping heads with it’). Before WWII JARHEADS was already in widespread use. A 1933 article stated ‘the [Marine] sergeants …moved into the second class cabins, and it took three days and a squad of JARHEADS to get them and their baggage moved to the troop class.\n\nDictionaries and military history websites seem to give varying explanations for the origin of JARHEAD. In addition to the above ideas, here are a few more:\n\nA U.S. Marine. Perhaps from the shape of the hat the Marines once wore. (American Heritage Dictionary of English)\n\nA slang term used by sailors as early as World War II to refer to members of the Marine Corps, drawing the term from the resemblance of the Marine dress blues uniform, with its high collar, to a Mason jar which at the time was made from blue glass. (military history website)\n\nGRUNT, or Marine. Reportedly, due to the ""high and tight"" haircut favored by many marines; it looks as if someone put a bowl on the victim’s head and cut or shaved off all the hair that protruded.\n\nNote: Definitions, dates, and quotes were assembled from Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Cassell’s Dictionary of Slang, Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, various ('repectable-looking) websites.""\n\n\nYou can find more info at the following web site:\n\nhttp://www20.brinkster.com/gunnyg/jarhead.html\n\nHope this answers your question."

You do not have to let a doctor examine you in any way that makes you uncomfortable.  If you are feeling pressured by your doctor consider finding another one.\n\n\n\nIf you are older there are other tests such as\nBone density\nMammograms\n\nMost doctors will also run some blood work depending on your age and any concerns."

"2","How do you make a flip-flop?","","A flip flop is a circuit that can ""flip"" to one state and then later ""flop"" to another. So when a flip flop is ""set"" it has an output of 1 and ""reset"" it has an output of 0. Unlike other kinds of logic gates, the flip flop ""remembers"" its state (not after the power goes out though).\n\nSo there are lots of ways to make these. Common practice is to use two NOR gates or two NAND gates cross coupled. However, there are other kinds of flip flops that require more kinds of gates. You can also get ICs that have a flip flop function already built in and that's the easy way.\n\nSee the link below for a light-hearted discussion"

"2","What is physical weatering?","How do it takes places in rocks?the process of it taking place and diagrams","I hope this helps!\n\n\n\n\nWeathering refers to processes that physically breakdown and chemically alter earth material. Physical weathering, also known as mechanical weathering, is the breakdown of large pieces of earth material into smaller ones. Think of physical weathering as the disintegration of rock without changing its chemical composition. There are many ways earth material can be physically weathered. When water freezes in rock crevices it expands creating stress in the crevice. As the stress increases, the crevice widens ultimately breaking the rock. Plant roots wedge rocks apart as they grow into rock crevices too. The shrinking and swelling by alternating heating and cooling weakens mineral bonds causing the rock to disintegrate.\n\nA very important result of physical weathering is its impact on the surface area of weathered material. When a block of earth material is broken into several smaller pieces, the amount of exposed surface increases. Examine the diagram below. A block with a width, depth, and height of 1 cm has a total surface area of 6 square centimeters. If we break the block in half in all directions it yields eight smaller pieces all with width, height, and depth of .5 cm. Breaking the block apart creates additional exposed surfaces such that the total surface area is now 12 square centimeters. Having more total exposed surface provides more area upon which chemical reactions can take place to further weather the material."

She was named Australian of the Year for 2005 by Australian Prime Minister John Howard at a ceremony in Canberra to mark Australia Day.\nWood is the director of the Royal Perth Hospital burns unit and the Western Australia Burns Service. She was made famous for procedures using spray-on skin cultured from the patient?s own skin, used in the treatment of burn victims after the Bali bombing. She has started a company called Clinical Cell Culture (C3) to commercialise this procedure. \n\nWood is the mother of six children.\n\nBurns doctor named Australian of the Year\nPerth plastic surgeon Fiona Wood has been named Australian of the Year, while an environmentalist, a film-maker and a philanthropist have taken out the other 2005 honours.\n\nPrime Minister John Howard has made the announcements outside Parliament House in Canberra.\n\nDr Wood is the director of the Royal Perth Hospital's burns unit and the Western Australia Burns Service.\n\nWestern Australia's only female plastic surgeon, Dr Wood came to prominence for the use of spray-on skin that she pioneered in the treatment of burn victims after the Bali bombings.\n\nThe new treatment, which is still under development, reduces by a three-quarters the time it takes to produce enough skin cells to cover major burns.\n\nShe says she hopes to use her profile to raise awareness of the need for ongoing research into better ways to treat serious burns. \n\n""I've had the privilege of making basic science impact upon medical care, always striving to do better for our burns patients, always striving to make the quality of that scar worth the pain of survival,"" she said. \n\nDr Wood is also a businesswoman - she is the co-founder of the private company Clinical Cell Culture.\n\nThe company has been recognised in medical circles for its world-leading research.\n\nThe chair of the National Australia Day Council board, Lisa Curry-Kenny, says Dr Wood, who is also a mother of six, has been honoured for her outstanding medical contributions.\n\n""Fiona has dedicated her life to raising a family and helping others through her extraordinary medical talent and is an outstanding Australian of the Year selection,"" Ms Curry-Kenny said.\n\nDr Wood succeeds Steve Waugh, who was last year's Australian of the Year.\n\n""I'm here tonight as a a surgeon and an immensely proud Australian,"" Dr Wood said.\n\nShe has been chosen ahead of seven other nominated Australians, including Academy Award-winning actor and UNICEF ambassador Nicole Kidman, and United Nations humanitarian worker Rodney Cox.\n\nYoung Australian\n\nThe national awards also honour outstanding Australians in three other categories - Young Australian of the Year, Senior Australian of the Year and Local Hero.\n\nNew South Wales film-maker, writer, actor and law student Khoa Do has been named the 2005 Young Australian of the Year. \n\nThe 25-year-old has been nominated for an AFI Award for his screenplay for the short film Delivery Day.\n\nWhen asked in 2002 to teach film production to 'at risk' youths in the Sydney suburb of Cabramatta, Mr Khoa turned the life experiences of his students into the internationally acclaimed film The Finished People.\n\nMr Khoa came to Australia as a refugee.\n\nSenior Australian\n\nThe 2005 Senior Australian of the Year is Antonio Milhinhos in recognition of his community service efforts.\n\nMr Milhinhos, who built a retail/wholesale distribution business, is a migrant from Portugal.\n\nSince the day he donated the entire stock of his supermarket to families affected by Cyclone Tracy's devastating assault on Darwin, Mr Milhinhos has not stopped giving.\n\nMr Milhinhos's time and money has benefited countless charities, including the RSPCA, Guide Dogs Australia, Variety Club and the Farmhand Drought Relief Appeal.\n\nHis most recent donation was to Care Australia's "

"3","What kind of psychotherapy works the best?","","The answer to your question is not easy. Some therapists use a limited approach (ie. only interpersonal, focused on your relationships with others.) In my opinion, CBT (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) is often successful if other approaches have failed. \n\nI am the maintainer of a portal called http://health.wikispaces.com that is helping to answer (I hope) precisely these kinds of questions. It is Invitation-Only, so that it is not open to misinformation. (people who can access the site can also edit it to add their own research, and experiences.)\n\nThe answer to your question is that depending on the reason you are seeking psychotherapy, different methods will work best.\n\nI think this is really a multistep question, so I am going to give you some sources of information and then ask you to come back for a follow-up.\n\nWebMD.com, using experts from the Cleveland clinic (WebMD uses different sources, some of which are not very comforting), has a detailed article on psychotherapy I highly recommend:\nhttp://www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htm\n\nI am going to add to this. The first thing you should discuss with any therapist is what brought you to see them, and what your goals are, and also billing. Insurance will often cover up to a certain amount; some therapists or social workers (both do therapy to some degree) work on a sliding pay scale (ie. they negociate on rate you pay.)\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htm\n\nMy local counselor here at Earlham College in Richmond, IN says that eclectic therapists are the best -- ie. the ones that can use any approach that seems helpful. (She has a Masters in Social Work.) \n\nTherapists vary. Some are really good and give you specific directed guidance. Techniques are being researched all the time. I just saw a really good article on 'resellience therapy' which sounded really cool. (If you are interested, I will provide you with the link.)\n\nLet me know how I  can best assist you!\n\n--Sam, journalist and healer of myself"

Any time you have bad thoughts About Allah rember Allah says""He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is Nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees (all things).""\n(  سورة الشورى  , Ash-Shura, Chapter #42, Verse #11)\n\n""There is Nothing Whatever like unto Him"" This shows us that there is nothing even close to comparison to Allah so anytime you have a bad thought about Allah remember that the thought cant be Allah cause ""There is Nothing Whatever like unto Him"" and just wipe that thought out/ignore it.\n\nAnother thing you could do is to gain Knowledge about ISlam the more you learn the less doors Shaytan has to attack you with.\n\nAlso you should not say ""my Allah or my Religion"" because Allah doesnt belong to us but we(mankind&Jinn) belong to Allah and to Him is our return.

Maybe you did not mean to say this in the way i interpreted It but just in case.\n\nInshaAllah this information has been Helpful if I said Anything Good it is from the Grace Of ALLAH and if Said anything wrong it is from myself.\n                   Salamu Alaykum WaRahmatuAllahi WaBarakatu"
"3","how to make one vomit?","if we doubt one is intoxicated (for eg a child who ate something bad) how do we make one vomit?","For any type of swallowing an object that shouldn't be, or injesting a poison, you need to call your local poison control center first for a poisoning, or your doctor before doing anything.  This way they can give you the proper remedy according to the specific item that was swallowed. Inducing vomiting can lead to serious complications if it is done by mistake for something that shouldn't have vomiting induced."

"2","Why do Bell Peppers come in different colors:  Green, Red, and Orange?","Is there a nutritional difference between the different colored bell peppers?","The bell pepper has many  color and it can be green, red, yellow, orange and, more rarely, white, purple and brown depending on when they are harvested.  \nVariety + Time of maturity= color\nBell Boy (70 days to harvest; goes green to red)\nLady Bell (72 days; goes green to red)\nPurple Belle (70 days; immature purple, black to red)\nChocolate Bell (75 days; green to chocolate brown)\nGypsy (65 days to harvest; pale yellow to orange to red)\nSweet Banana (70 days; pale yellow to orange to red)\n*Fruits may be harvested at any size desired. Green bell varieties, however, are usually picked when they are fully grown and mature—3 to 4 inches long, firm and green. When the fruits are mature, they break easily from the plant. Less damage is done to the plants, however, if the fruits are cut rather than pulled off. The new, colored bell pepper fruits may be left on the plant to develop full flavor and ripen fully to red, yellow, orange or brown; or they may be harvested green and immature. Some (including ""white,"" light yellow, lilac and purple) are colors that develop in the immature fruit and that should be harvested before actually ripening, when they turn red. \nHot peppers are usually harvested at the red-ripe stage; but ""green chiles,"" the immature fruits, are also required for some recipes."

"2","how does convection help plate tectoic movement?","i need this to help me in school. Thank You!","The mechanisms of tectonic plate movement is quite complex, but in its simplest terms, tectonic plates float on molten magma of the earth's interior. Convection currents within the molten magma behave similarly to convection currents in a pan of water being heated on the stove. Water on the bottom of the pan is heated and begins to rise because it is slightly less dense than the cooler water on the top. The cooler is slightly more dense and begins to sink. As this water is heated, it begins to rise, thus a convection movement or convection current is created in the water in the pan. \n\nMagma is far more dense than water and is much hotter, but it is still a fluid. Magma near the core is hotter than the magma beneath the crust. Hotter magma moves up, cooler magma moves down, very very very slowly, but none the less, it moves. The crust, a.k.a. tectonic plates float on the magma. Float some pieces of Styrofoam on the water in the pan. What happens? The foam moves around by the convection forces in the water.  Tectonic plates do the same thing. Its just not as fast.\n\nHope this helps."

I think the colour of the kernels can be used (red, white or yellow or a mixture of these colours) to decide if the genes are dominant or recessive. In other fruit and vegetables colour is more variable, or depends on several genes. Corn (maze) also grows faster than peas, and certainly faster than apples, and the results can be seen before the ear is ripe, so you don't have to wait as long for the results. \n\nHope this helps"

Light traveling tangential to the atmosphere gets redirected to earth as it interacts with the atmospheres gas molecules.

This makes the sky more blue say on the horizon than directly above at noon."

I met people who were not in favor of arranged marriage but did not want to disobey or shame their parents so they would go through with it when the time was right.  I divorce in that sense would shame the family.  Also because it is arranged and in many Indians case Dowry is exchanged it is more like a business deal.  In the West our parents are not involved.

"3","what is a pelvic ultrasound?","","Ultrasound is a technology that uses sound waves (the waves are outside of the range of human hearing) and based on the time it takes to echo the sound wave back, it can draw a 'picture' of what the sound waves bounce against.\n\nThink of it like ""bouncing a ball"" on the ground, the quick the ball comes back to you, the less distance it travelled, and you can ""vizualize"" that the ground is higher in some spots than other spots.  You can put that information together in order to draw a picture.\n\nA 'pelvic' ultrasound just means that an ultrasound is done in the pelvic area, most likely used to examine the bladder, lower intestinal region or the uterus for females in order to make sure that everything looks normal.\n\nAn ultrasound is a non-invasive, painless procedure.  The device used is usually lubricated with a water-based lubricant and then pressed to the skin and moved over the area that is being 'photographed' by the ultrasonic sound waves."

"1","What is the place and respect of lord SUN in Sikhism?","Sun means surya in hindi & Suraj in PUNJABI","Sikhism is a branch of hinduism , though influenced by sufism. Sikhs are very much hindus otherwise. Most of them follow all hindu beliefs. They may not practice sun practice specially but they celebrate sun related festivals and rever it this way. Sankrati , lohari all are related with sun.\n\nAdded:\nAnswerer below me is ignorant about sikhism even if he belongs to it. \n\n""Hinduism is a generic name given to all the faiths which have roots in India and believe in Parmatma (God), Prarthana (prayer), Punerjanma (reincarnation), Purushartha (Karma) and Prani Daya (kindness to all living beings)."" Sikhism believes in all of these.\n\n The Granth contains specific references to Hindu gods such as Rama and Krishna. The gurudwaras, or Sikh temples, have always been decorated with pictures of Hindu devas and devis. The first desecration of these pictures was in 1906 at Harmandir, and this was the first action taken by separatist Sikhs.\n\nReference is made to the avatars of Vishnu in the Granth Sahib. The Dasma Granth deals with all the avatars beginning on page 169. Volume two of the Dasma Granth is exclusively based on Krishna. It is accepted that Guru Gobind Singh was a staunch believer in Durga Mata (Mother Goddess). In the entire Guru Granth Sahib, the Vedas are respected and referred to as sacred. Guru Gobind Singh states that the Vedas originated from Brahma and the path of the Vedas is the only path for the people to follow. Sikhism heavily bases itself on Karma yoga (the science of actions) and states that if an individual acts only on good deeds, selfless acts with a pure devotion to God, they can achieve the ultimate state of existence.\n\nThe speech of one of the greatest modern Sikh leaders, Master Tara Singh, at a meeting in Bombay on August 19, 1964, who declared:\n\n""Sikhs and Hindus are not separate. Sikhs will survive only if Hindus survive. Sikhs are part and parcel of the Hindu Society. Guru Govind Singhji brought in Gurumukhi the wisdom and philosophy from our scriptures and Puranas. Are we going to give up this heritage?""\n\n\n\nTaha hum adhik tapasya sadhi\nMahakal kalika aradhi\n~ Guru Govind Singh\n(There I worshipped and did penance to seek Kali.) \n\nRam katha jug jug atal\nSab koi bhakhat net Suragbas Raghuver kara\nSagri puri samet Jo en Katha sune aur gaave\nDukh pap tah nikat na aave\n~ Guru Govind Singh\n(The story of Ram is immortal and everyone should read it.

Not to mention, diets that cause you to lose a large amount of weight in a short amount of time are damaging to your health, and you will most likely put the weight back on shortly after you lose it.

"1","When in the Bible, It says ""Thout shalt not kill"", Does that Mean do not kill animals and bugs too?","This bothers me. Please answer.","Man was given dominion over the animals because he has reason. It is also in his rational nature that his dignity resides. If you think there is a difference between man because he cans think and choose to do right and wrong, then there must be a difference between his dignity as a person and the dignity of animals. Because of his dignity as steward and caretakers of the animals on this earth, he must treat them with respect and reverence but not as his equals because they do not think and do not make choices.\n\nSince the commandments were given by God to all of mankind in order that he might follow his laws and be in community, it is the law between men in society, and therefore it does not apply to animals and bugs. That does not mean the man should wantonly kill animals for no reason, but it does not forbid him from killing them for food or being their are pests to his crops, and well being. For example, mosquitoes bring to man many diseases, it would not be right for him to refrain from killing them if they cause serious illness or death to his family and himself. \n\nI hope that helps."

As a result of having kept the requirements of Mormanism, he was exalted to godhood and inherited his own universe.  God is confined to a body of flesh and bones and yet is thought to be omniscient and omnipotent.  He obviously can not be omnipresent.  There are an infininte number of gods with their own worlds.  These too were previously men, The Holy Ghost, Jesus Christ and ""Heavenly Father"" comprise 3 separate and distinct gods. Heavenly Father sires spiritual children in heaven destined for human life on earth.  All humans, as well as Jesus Christ and Lucifer, are gods heavenly children.  Every human being has the potential of becoming a god by keeping the requirements of Mormonism.  The Morman plan of salvation is built on the idea that all people have eternal life, but only the most faithful Mormons have godhood or enter the celestial kingdom.  In order to obtain this ultimate step, Mormons must exercise faith in the God of Mormonism, its Christ, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; exercise repentence; and be baptisted in the LDS church.  Additionaly Mormons must keep the ""Word of Wisdom"" by abstaning from alcohol, tobacco, and caffiene; tithe to the church; attend weekly sacrament meetings; support the Mormon prophet; do temple works; and be active in their support of the Church.  \n\nIs this Christianity, I think not."

Dutch spectacle-makers Hans Janssen and his son Zacharias Janssen are often said to have invented the first compound microscope in 1590, but this was a declaration by Zacharias Janssen himself halfway through the 17th century. The date is certainly not likely, as it has been shown that Zacharias Janssen actually was born around 1590. Another favorite for the title of 'inventor of the microscope' was Galileo Galilei. He developed an occhiolino or compound microscope with a convex and a concave lens in 1609. Galilei´s microscope was celebrated in the ´Lynx academy´ founded by Federico Cesi in 1603. Francesco Stelluti´s drawing of three bees were part of pope Urban VIII´s seal, and count as the first microscopic figure published (see Stephen Jay Gould, The Lying stones of Marrakech, 2000). Christiaan Huygens, another Dutchman, developed a simple 2-lens ocular system in the late 1600's that was achromatically corrected and therefore a huge step forward in microscope development. The Huygens ocular is still being produced to this day, but suffers from a small field size, and the eye relief is uncomfortably close compared to modern widefield oculars.\n\nAnton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) is generally credited with bringing the microscope to the attention of biologists, even though simple magnifying lenses were already being produced in the 1500's, and the magnifying principle of water-filled glass bowls had been described by the Romans (Seneca). Van Leeuwenhoek's home-made microscopes were actually very small simple instruments with a single very strong lens. They were awkard in use but enabled van Leeuwenhoek to see highly detailed images, mainly because a single lens does not suffer the lens faults that are doubled or even multiplied when using several lenses in combination as in a compound microscope. It actually took about 150 years of optical development before the compound microscope was able to provide the same quality image as van Leeuwenhoek's simple microscopes. So although he was certainly a great microscopist, van Leeuwenhoek is, contrary to widespread claims, certainly not the inventor of the microscope."

Mumps was the commonest cause of viral meningitis in children prior to 1988, when the MMR vaccine was introduced. \n\nLess commonly, inflammation of the pancreas can also occur. \n\nFemales can also get inflammation of the ovaries, called oophoritis, and males, inflammation of the testicles, called orchitis. \n\nOccasionally mumps orchitis may lead to infertility. \n\nMumps can also cause permanent deafness. \n\nWhat is the treatment? \n\nThere is no specific treatment for mumps. \n\nTreatment should be based on alleviating symptoms."

OR, do you think social oder is more important than individual liberty.  for example: wath your telephone calls randomly (invading your privacy) in order to make society stable, detect crimes and terrorism more easy.   limit your free press (for instance, don't talk about this, don't talk about that) in order to stop any inflamming of feelings in society.  \nThank you","Social order without education, individual empowerment and individual thinking is a time bomb.\n\nUsually and educated, critically minded population will need much less social or legal support to create social cohesion.

As different type of tumors has different prognostic rate. \n  Whatever, I tried to give you some information about the small bowel cancer and theirs prognosis, but it is not complete and definite and varies according to patient general status, site of tumor and co-morbid conditions.\n\nThe small bowel can be affected by both malignant(Bad prognosis) and benign (relatively good prognosis) lesions.\n\nMalignant tumors — the most common histologic types of malignant tumors of the small intestine are:\n (* percent is the distribution of each type to total cancers of small bowel)\n\n   Adenocarcinoma — 45 percent\n\n   Carcinoid — 29 percent\n\n   Lymphoma — 15 percent\n\n   Sarcoma — 10 percent\n\n\nAlthough these malignancies may be found throughout the different regions of the intestine,  certain subtypes have a predilection for specific regions. As an example, adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy affecting the proximal small intestine, while carcinoid is the most common tumor in the ileum. \nSarcoma and lymphoma develop throughout the small intestine, but are most prevalent in the distal small bowel. Largely as a result of these differences in distribution, the reported relative incidence of each histology varies considerably with the patient population.\n\nBenign lesions of small bowel include adenomas, leiomyomas, fibromas, and lipomas. \n\nIf you are talking about the small bowel Adenocarcinoma with stage IV, it means that the tumor has any size, has invaded regional lymphnodes, but it must have distant metastases either in liver, lung, brain, bone or anyother part of body.\n\nThe time line strickly about the small bowel adenocarcinoma: \n\nPrognosis: \nadenocarcinoma — \nMural penetration, nodal involvement, distant metastasis, and perineural invasion are associated with a poor prognosis. Seventy to eighty percent of small bowel adenocarcinomas are resectable at the time of diagnosis; approximately 35 percent have metastasized to regional lymph nodes, and an additional 20 to 35 percent have distant metastasis .\n\nIn general, for patients undergoing resection of duodenal adenocarcinomas, five-year survival rates are similar, stage for stage, to those for colorectal cancer. As an example, in one series of 67 patients with nonampullary adenocarcinoma of the duodenum, the overall five-year survival rate was 54 percent; stratified by stage, five-year survival was as follows [42]:\n\n   Stage I — 100 percent\n\n   Stage II — 52 percent\n\n   Stage III — 45 percent\n\n   Stage IV — 0 percent\n\n\n  Prognosis: distal small bowel adenocarcinomas — Compared to duodenal cancers, regional node metastases are more frequent in jejunal or ileal adenocarcinomas [28,58,59]. Survival is generally poor, with most series reporting five-year survival rates of 20 to 30 percent. Between 60 and 70 percent of patients without lymph node involvement survive five years [28,60], compared to only 12 to 14 percent of those with positive nodes [28,61].\n\nSarcoma:\nSurvival rates are variable, with tumor grade being an important determinant [73,74]. In one study, for example, patients with low grade lesions (fewer than 10 mitoses per 50 high power fields) had an 80 percent disease-free survival at eight years [74]. In contrast, patients with high grade lesions had a mean disease free survival of less than 18 months."

Good question to know the answer to before digging into religion.\n\nReligious inspiration is inseparable from Faith! Though I like Schneb and all the answers he freely offers total strangers, a truly wonderful trait; I expect you will find even his answer unsatisfactory.  So I'll offer this...\n\nScripture is inspired by God.  ---By Faith---  You see, it's totally possible a person who never communicates with God to stumble upon a Bible and find it utterly ridiculous.  This is, I believe, because he is a natural (you know, naturalism, looking for only natural explanations to physical phenomenon) man who has never applied himself to study of the spiritual realm.  However, a person who takes the basic knowledge of God's existence which God gives every man and spends his life learning more about God will make very much use of Faith-the human means of communication with the divine.  In the end, of the two people, the natural and spiritual, the spiritual will be ""inspired"" or ""revealed"" to know much more than the natural will ""discover,"" because the spiritual will have learned how to commune with His creator, which he will continue to do throughout all eternity.\nSo, to summarize learn all you can in school.  Study all the hard sciences and make ""discoveries,"" but more importantly, spend much time in prayer, in nature, in scripture reading, and allow the Lord to ""reveal"" to you.  In the end your ""inspirations"" from God will be infinitely more valuable than your ""discoveries"" in nature.  \nOh, and don't worry, they won't be in disagreement in the end.  Does that help?\nGod bless!\nGood question!\nThis is an Orthodox Christian response."

"1","Many women go church as they are going to party or a bar, now time for Women need a head covering agree?","","I was raised Roman Catholic, and, years ago, women had to cover their heads when entering a Catholic Church.\n\nThis has now changed.\n\nI think it is good that anyone, man or woman, simply GOES to church, anymore.\n\nI do think that men and women, both, should dress appropriately if going to any place of worship (church, temple, mosque). It's not a disco or a bar, fer cryin out loud! Wear the nicest clothes that you have. Even if the best you can manage is a t-shirt and jeans, make sure that you are as clean and neat as possible - but GO!\n\nPersonally, I do not think that women should be required to cover their heads. When men are in a place of worship their minds should be on worship, not the desirability of the women, however they are dressed. That is the men's responsibility, not the women's, in my opinion!"

"2","Why do some fish normally live in freshwater and others in saltwater? How can some fish adapt to both?","","Fresh water creates a hypotonic environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms, whose cell walls will burst if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles,[2] while freshwater fishes excrete excess water via the kidney.[3] Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, some fishes have the ability to migrate between fresh water and sea water.\n\nAs with many aquatic animals, most fishes release their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. Some of the wastes diffuse through the gills into the surrounding water. Others are removed by the kidneys, excretory organs that filter wastes from the blood. Kidneys help fishes control the amount of ammonia in their bodies. Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of osmosis. In saltwater fish, the kidneys concentrate wastes and return as much water as possible back to the body. The reverse happens in freshwater fish, they tend to gain water continuously. The kidneys of freshwater fish are specially adapted to pump out large amounts of dilute urine. Some fishes have specially adapted kidneys that change their function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater"
"3","is carbohydrates good for building muscles?","","well my friend IMHO I can answer you that pretty well. Carbs are the fuel for your muscle when you work out. The best carbs during the day are complex carbs like sweet potato and oatmeals, and veggies. When you are about to workout , during workout and right after finishing your training are simple carbs with fast digesting protein. Best bet is a combination (50:50 of glucose and dextrose) and whey protein. If you really want to educate your self in proper nutrition for building muscle I recommend you google John Berardi website and www.burnthefat.com you will learn a lot and with time, will power and patience you will achieve an awesome body like I have done. Discipline is the key ans YES you need carbs to fuel the engine to grow. Just the proper kind of carb, proper amount and time to eat them.\nIts part of what  you need to learn\nHave a great day"

Looking for English or Latin Name","The 'Dibon' or 'Dibbon' is the Abyssinian Ground-hornbill [Latin: Bucorvus abyssinicus] (also known as Northern Ground-hornbill). It lives in the Northern tributaries of the River Niger in Guinea and the Sahel of Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe dibon pairs for life, and the pairs of birds spend the night sleeping in separate trees and early in the morning call to each other. The local people have found the calls of the dibon so complelling that supposedly up to 40% of the rhythms played in the local traditions in the range of the dibon are based on these calls."

She talks to him more than with her kids. The man tells her that kids are nothing but problems and that is why he never have kids. The woman believe him and regret having kids. Why do adults in her 40s have to fall through what other tell them without using their own judgement on what's right and what's wrong?","by the age of 40 she should really know her own mind, she is a mature adult not an impressionable child.  it's likely all of her relationships have been like this, she must be submissive, maybe she has never had a relationship where she felt able to have an opinion or express how she feels.\nBut to regret having children just because this man has given her that idea is out of order, it must be hurtful for the children as well.

"1","whats inri stand for on the cross?","","IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM\n\nSince anyone who would actually see the paintings of the Crucifixion in the Middle Ages (inside a Church) would then already be familiar with the phrase (in Latin), the painters all apparently chose to simplify their paintings by only including the initials of the four Latin words, I N R I. The early Church had also apparently used that abbreviation.\n\nLuke 23:38 also mentions the sign on the Cross, and he mentions that the sign was written in three languages, Greek, Latin and Hebrew. Scholars then chose to follow the wording presented in John, as it is more complete by including the reference to Nazareth, and as it might be presenting the Latin version of the text on the Cross. In all three languages the first word was Jesus, but since Greek and Hebrew don't use the letter J, His Name was spelled beginning with an I. The Roman (Latin) spelling followed that, (IESVS) even though their language included a J. The second word represented Nazareth, or Nazarene, N. The third word represented king, which in Latin (REX) begins with an R. The fourth word represented Jews, (IVDAEORVM) again spelled beginning with an I. You can see that the INRI then says ""Jesus Nazareth King Jews""."

"2","How are density, displacement, and bouyancy related\nbouyancy, and \ndisplacement related?","","Displacement refers to the volume of liquid or gas displaced by an object.\n\nDensity is the mass to volume ratio.  The more mass in a given space, the more dense it is.\n\nBuoyancy is the ratio of the mass of an object to the mass of the gas or liquid displaced by that object (or basically a comparison of two densities).  If the mass of the object is less than the mass it displaces, it is considered to be buoyant and tend to rise to the top of the gas or liquid (provided that there is gravity or centripetal force present).\n\nSo, an object that has a density greater than its surrounding will need to attached or put inside an object that is less dense than its surroundings to float.  An example might be a steel-hulled ship.  The steel by itself would not float on water.  But, because it creates a huge pocket of air (which is less dense than water), the overall mass of the ship is less than the mass of the water it displaces, which allows it to float."

Even in the first few centuries in American history, the ""great melting pot"" of cultures and religions, monotheism was the only acceptable form of religion. It has only been in the last 80-100 years that polytheists have been recognized and accepted into the mainstream of western society. \n\nIt took Christianity some 300 years to gain acceptance as a valid religion. Considering that, polytheism is making a pretty effective comeback into society. \n\n-SD-"

"2","What are the weather conditions that makes it favorable for tornado's?","","In the US Midwest, tornadoes are usually formed when a cold, dry air mass moving south from Canada collides with a warm, moist air mass moving north from the Gulf of Mexico (or Baja California, or the Atlantic, or what have you). \nThis produces large thunderstorm clouds known as supercells, which can produce heavy rains, hail, and tornados. \nTornados are formed in areas of the supercell called mesocyclones; which draws air into the storm. When you hear meteorologists talk about the ""hook echo"" on the radar, they're pointing out the mesocyclone. The best simple explanation (so far) for why the tornado starts to rotate is the phenomenon of vertical wind sheer, where wind changes direction at different elevations.\nSo, if you have access to a weather radar; you can see hook echos like the one below. If you have a wind velocity view (some do, some don't), look for a large difference in wind speed and direction around that hook echo."
"1","I am atheist but why are so many atheist so pig faced agains religion? If they know better then why not act it","","It is my belief that many Atheist have doubts about their belief and therefore have to bash religions in order to bolster their own weak belief in Atheism. Then some just find bashing religion fun as religious people find it fun to bash us. What difference does that make we are all just having fun. I am an Atheist but I am a strong believer in the US Constitution which gives freedom of religion. I think everyone should be free to practice their religion and believe as they please as long as it doesn't prevent others from practicing theirs. God bless kisses Betty."

"2","Environment vs genetics and lung cancer.?","Are genetic traits the primary case of lung cancer or is it the envirement.\nDont go by what you have been told. Lets give it some serious thought","Environment is easily the primary cause of lung cancer.  I'm not even aware of any genetic disorders that are associated with lung cancer.\n\nSmoking is the primary cause of lung cancer.  Before smoking was common, lung cancer was exceedingly rare.  Back in the early 1900's (1904 I believe), a doctor in the US found a man with lung cancer, and he wrote to all of his doctor friends to gather them so that they could have a part in this ""once in a lifetime"" chance to see a lung cancer patient.\n\nI wish I could photograph some of my textbooks to show you the correlation between smoking and lung cancer.  \n\nThe main causes of lung cancer are smoking, asbestos inhalation, and radon inhalation.  Each of these works via a completely different mechanism.  Smoking works by causing mutations in DNA with chemical carcinogens.  Asbestos works by causing excessive proliferation of certain lung cells, which increases the chance of a transcription error.  Radon works by emmitting alpha radiation, which causes DNA mutations by breaking DNA strands.  Radon then half-lifes into polonium, which adheres to the cells in your lungs and continues to emit radiation, causing more damage.  All three of these mechanisms have only become important within the last century.  Smoking was not popular until the 1940's or so, asbestos was not used prior to the 1950-60's or so, and radon accumulation in homes was not a problem before a similar timeframe.\n\nThere is really no contest between environmental and heredity effects on lung cancer.  Before smoking, asbestos, and radon, there was virtually no lung cancer at all."

"3","Is anxiety ever a side effect of birth control pills?","","Yes, it is.  I can tell you from personal experience that if this is a side effect that you think is being caused by your pill, you should go off of it immediately.  Everyone is different though, my suggestion would be to find a pill with a different concoction of hormones.  Most pills generally contain a combination of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol, namely ortho tri-cyclen or ortho tri-cyclen lo, which is what i was originally on.  Those pills work for some women but those of us who have higher estrogen levels get more of the listed possible side effects.  My doctor switched me to yasmin which contains Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol.  Chemically, it seems to agree with me.  The only side effect I have experience so far is an occasianal tummy ache.  I would definitely check with your gyno and find out what they reccomend for your specific needs."

"3","What creates ""mob mentality""?","In other words, why do people start acting irrationally in a group?  Would they do these things on their own?  Is there a way to calm them down?","A lot of it is ""division of responsibility"".  If something happens and one person witnesses it, that person realizes that he or she is the only person that has responsibility for subsequent events.  When you start adding people to this scenario, each person mentally reduces their own responsibility for events, so with 10 people, most people will only feel 10% responsibility.\n\nIt is (sadly) not really irrational for what happens in mobs - often it is the removal of responsibility that allows people to act on their selfish impulses."

"2","What's the difference between 'incomplete dominance' and 'recombinant'?","in intermediate between the phenotype of individuals with homozygous for either allele. For ex. the cross between a red flower(C^R,C^R) and white flower (C^W,C^W), and the F^1 Generation is pick flower (C^R, C^W). The F^2 generation of breeding btw F^1 Generation shows that for every four (The ratio 1:2:1) There was one red flower, two pink, and one white. So, isn't this same as Recombinant (an off spring whose phenotype differs from that of the parents) Wtf!! That's the same as incomplete dominance! The the offspring (two pink flower) is different from either of their ""parents"" white, and red flower...So what IS the difference between these two?!","Incomplete dominance\nIn incomplete dominance (sometimes called partial dominance), a heterozygous genotype creates an intermediate phenotype. In this case, only one allele (usually the wild type) at the single locus is expressed, creating an intermediate phenotype. A cross of two intermediate phenotypes (= monohybrid heterozygotes)will result in the reappearance of both parent phenotypes and the intermediate phenotype.\nThe classic example of this is the colors of carnations.\n       R   R'\nR RR RR' \nR' RR' R'R' \nR is the allele for red pigment. R' is the allele for no pigment.\nThus, RR offspring make a lot of red pigment and appear red. R'R' offspring make no red pigment and appear white. RR' and R'R offspring make a little bit of red pigment and therefore appear pink.\nRecombinant\nThe term recombinant DNA refers to a new combination of DNA molecules that are not found together naturally. Although processes such as crossing over technically produce recombinant DNA, the term is generally reserved for DNA produced by joining molecules derived from different biological sources."

If you are not familiar with this, it is when you rub the mineral across a piece of unglazed porcelain plate or tile.\n\nIn a streak test the gold will leave behind a gold streak while pyrite will leave behind a black one. This works, trust me, I know. All you need is a piece of unglazed porcelain.\n\nYou said earlier about rubbing it across the skin. I have never seen this work however some cheap jewlery is made of pyrite & will leave the fingers, etc. black looking. That is after you wear it a while.\n\nGold is very dense for its size. Pyrite is not nearly as dense. You could do a density test by displacement in water but I assume from what you told me that the ""gold"" is in a matrix.\n\nPyrite is usually found as a mass of cubic crystals. Sometimes they take on the appearance of a nugget b/c the cubes are very tiny. Gold will not have these cubes.\n\nGold is sometimes found in quartz veins. If you have a chunk of quartz it is possible that there is some gold in there.\n\nGo with the streak test & let us know what happens.\n\n:)"

"2","What is the angle between a planet's spin axis and the solar wind (usually) for solar system planets?","","The solar wind comes from the sun in all directions - therefore it would hit any planet in the orbital plane at a right angle. This would be the case if all planets revolved with a perfect 0 dgree axial tilt\n\nBut you have to consider the angle of the planets tilt - Earths is 23.5 degrees, and Uranus is a whopping 80 odd degrees. It also depends on where the planet is along its orbit - ie during british summer time we are tilted by our postion in orbit toward the sun,  - that is the North Pole is  angled more toward the sun. During winter - when we have traveled to the 'other side' of the sun the oposite is true - the pole is angled away from the sun."

"1","atheists: how this world would look like without Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Islam, Christianity)?","Please think before answering, and please elaborate. Avoid short answers like ""much better"". I understand it can only be unscientific guesswork, but the question looks interesting for me nevertheless.","Prior to revelation at Sinai, there were no ethical/moral laws.  Each group of people were governed by their own God, pharoah, king, etc. and were at his/her/its mercy.  \nAfter revelation at Sinai, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for 40 years as they learned to live in ""freedom"" with God and His laws as a guide.  Since the Israelites had never lived in freedom, they were doomed to wander in the wilderness until their children became of age and were able to function as a free people under God, their king, in the promised land.\nIn the promised land, everyone was held accountable to God's law -- especially the leaders.  It was a duty and privilege for everyone to study Torah, learn the law, and to assure that everyone received equal treatment under God's law.  Because everyone studied the law, the Levites could not invent and change laws willy-nilly.  They were accountable to God just the same as the lowly sheperd.\nOver time, God's laws have been adopted by other nations and justice for all has prevailed in some countries.\nWithout the laws of the Torah, insane leaders could commit monstrous acts of violence and atrocities without consequences.  Men could kill women and children simply from a fit of anger.  Everyone would live in constant terror not knowing from where the next threat would come.\nIn essence, we owe our freedom from terror to the words of wisdom found in this wonderful book we call our Bible!  \nIn today's world of terrorism, it makes one wonder how those words have become so distorted."

But I wanted to get it done, for the same reasons as you, when I was a teenager. I didn't because, also like you, I didn't wanna feel awkward with my parents. It was a mistake waiting: 1. by the time I got circumcised, my foreskin got so tight I needed to be, 2. when (much later) I did tell my parents they were fine about it and said that, if that's what I needed or wanted, they'd have paid for it earlier and 3. you get a better job done and it heals quicker the younger you are.\nIt's not particularly painful when healing up and, as other people have written to you, done under local or general anaesthetic anyway. A good idea is to wear briefs, rather than boxer shorts, for a while afterwards.\nI'm really happy that I'm now circumcised.\nGood Luck!\nNick"

If you're a regular smoker, for example, you're going to go freaking nuts at times while the nicotine is exiting your system. At least get some patches, gum, or whatever so that you don't go mental! Also, you might want to ring a support number for quitters. I used Quitline in Australia. They helped enormously."

We were coming back from skiing in Alaska and the driver of the van was drunk and speeding. We went around a sharp coner very fast and the van spun around backwards and flipped over a berm of snow. We were going so fast that the van did a complete flip in the air and landed on its wheels in the snow some 40 feet off the road. All the windows popped out of the van, but nobody was hurt, nor was the van really dented up.\n\nWe had passed several friends before crashing and heard them coming down the highway. I suggested we hang out of the open windows of the van and pretend we were all hurt as our friends arrived on the scene.

"2","why does plants need water to surrive?","","Although water is required for photosynthesis the amount of water actually required is tiny, almost immeasurable even in large tree. In contrast a large tree will use hundreds of gallons of water every single day. More importantly a plant that is in the dark will die without water just as fast as a plant in full sunlight. Since photosynthesis can't occur in the dark we know that it can't be photosynthesis that  most of the water is required for.\n\nPlants need water for three main reasons, the first two are  exactly the same reasons that you need water. \n\n1) Water serves as the solvent for every chemcial reaction that makes up life. Without water life simply isn't possible because no chemical reactions assocaited with life can occur.\n\n2) Water is also essential for transporting nutrients around the plant, so minerals are taken from the soil to the leaves dissolved in water, and sugars are taken from the leaves to the roots dissolved in water.\n\n3) Plants use water to maintain their very shape. The cells themselves are held in shape by the pressure of the water inside them, like water-filled balloons. Without water the cells shrink and collapse, and we see this as the plant wilting. If the collapse goes to far t5he cells tear and that part of the plant dies."
"1","1st.Introduction for the CHRISTIANS about BIBLE?","IS ""BIBLE"" IN THE BIBLE ???\n____The Bible does not contain self-reference, that is, the word 'Bible' is not in the Bible. Nowhere does the Bible talk about itself. Some scriptures are sometimes pointed to in the Bible, say: Here where it talks about itself, but we have to look closely. 2nd Timothy 3:16 is the favourite which reads: “All scripture is inspired of God” and there are those who would say, here is where the Bible it talks about itself, it says it is inspired of God, all of it. But if you read the whole sentence, you read that this was a letter wrote by Paul to Timothy and the entire sentence says to Timothy: “Since you were a young man you have studied the holy scriptures, all scriptures inspired by God” and so on… When Timothy was a young man the New Testament did not exist, the only thing that stems he was talking about are scriptures – which are only a portion of the Bible - from before that time. It could not have meant the whole Bible.\n**PLEASE,give REASONABLE ARGUMENT","You are correct that the word Bible is not in the Bible.  I believe Bible is Latin for The Book.  Christian scripture that Paul was referencing was specific to the Old Testament because the New Testament didn't exist yet.  \n\nThe Old Testament become considered ""Bible"" when Jewish scholars selected the books to be included because of their consistency, historical accuracy, and spiritual quality. \n\nThe New Testament books included in the Bible were chosen by the early church around 300 A.D. for their consistency, historical accuracy, and spiritual quality as well.  \n\nIf you read the bible and compare it to other books that were not included by the Jewish or Christian scholars, i.e. the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, it will be easy to see why most of them were not included in the Bible."

"1","WHY OH WHY Do people blatantly throw their cigarettes butts down on the ground , sometimes right at your feet?","it is bewildering to me how people can still do this and how it is overlooked by the authorities . what do you think about this subject and what could I do as an Individual to inspire my government to stop these people from this micro toxic litter ( that is MOST disgusting ) ????","Probably for the same reasons people throw pop cans, beer cans, dirty diapers, food wrappers etc. on the ground..........because they are lazy or because there was no other place to put the cigarette butt. As far as the dangers involved in cigarette smoke, people have more to worry about as far as factory emissions and vehicle emissions than they do from a cigarette. Smoke rises! Go into a smoker's house and see where the stains from the cigarette smoke is found. It is found at the ceiling level. There are also more health risks from people urinating outside or pets urinating outside, than there are from a cigarette butt left on the ground. As far as the toxins from the cigarette leeching into the ground or getting into our water supply, the risks are far smaller than the chemicals that people use in their gardens and vehicles every day. I would be willing to bet that there are just as many beer cans and alcohol bottles thrown down on the ground each day as cigarette butts.  Look around and you will notice ALL the trash that is thrown down. It's disgusting no matter what the litter happens to be. Personally, I find it disgusting to see parents toss their child's dirty diaper onto the ground, just so they don't have to ride home in their car with the smelly diaper! They chose to have the child and anything that comes out of that child belongs to them! I hate when people allow their pets to roam around and use parks, other people's yards etc. for their bathroom. That is MOST disgusting!  I do have a concern about cigarette butts though, the cigarette butt can be toxic to children and animals, and a lit cigarette carries the danger of starting a fire. For those reasons I wish people wouldn't throw their cigarette butts on the ground and out their car windows. Littering of ANY kind is wrong and should carry a stiff fine. Unfortunately very few people who litter (any kind of litter) get caught. The reason it is overlooked by authorities is for the same reason other littering is overlooked. There just isn't enough manpower to deal with the situation. Police have more important things to deal with than drive around looking for litterbugs. I do think targeting one group of people for littering is wrong. If you want to protest against ALL littering that is fine, but to just have a problem with cigarette butts is ridiculous. The littering problem is not just cigarette butts. ALL littering needs to be stopped.\n\n\nResponse\n\nThank you Kenlas, I wasn't trying to say that there was no smoke down lower. People talk about the danger of second hand smoke even when they are outside. My point was that the little trail of smoke from a cigarette in comparison to everything the factories and vehicles spew out every day would not really be much of an issue. The majority of cigarette smoke rises almost immediately, leaving very little for others to be concerned about. I was using the ceiling in a smoker's house as an example of smoke rising. People want to believe that smoking and second hand smoke are the only causes of lung cancer, but researchers have NO way of proving that people who have never smoked developed lung cancer from second hand smoke. When they do their so called tests, they use HIGHLY concentrated amounts of cigarette smoke to try and prove their case. They know that the factories and vehicles spew out the same and worse toxins, in far larger quantities, than a cigarette, but because of the expense of forcing those two things to be made safer, they choose to ignore them for the most part and concentrate on a relatively small part of the population. Plus they can pass bills to outrageously raise taxes on cigarettes to help generate money whenever they need more money. I haven't seen them raising taxes on ALL alcohol to help generate more money, even though hundreds of people die due to drunk drivers each year. I don't see them banning alcohol in all public places to help reduce the amount"

"2","Do we need the moon?","what would happen if we had no moon and why do we only have one when other planets have more than one.","I swear I answer this question 4 or 5 times a week. \n\n1) Even without the moon we would still get tides. The tides are caused by both the sun and the moon equally. Solar tides would only be half as high as normal tides, and they would occur with a regular 12 hour rhythm rather than the monthly rhythm we get now.\n\n2) It would be almost impossible for complex life to survive without the moon. The moon locks the Earth into a stable position WRT the sun. As a result the equator always faces a the sun and the poles have always been perpendicular. Planets that lack large moons wobble, and at times the poles face the sun and the equator rotates perpendicular to the sun. At those times the temperature and light extremes would exterminate all complex life forms. \n\nWe don't know how long the Earth would remain in a perpendicular orientation  without the moon, but some time within the next half million years it would tip. When it did all surface life would die. Life would still be possible but every time the axis moved too far from perpendicular it would have to start afresh from deep sea bacteria.\n\n3) We have only one moon, and a very large moon, because it resulted from a collision AFTER the Earth had solidified. That collision tore off a huge chunk of the Earth and hurled it into orbit. In contrast the moons of other planets are either comets that have become trapped in orbit or were formed from the solar gas cloud BEFORE the planet itself formed.\n\nThe Earth's moon is unique in our solar system and is in no small part responsible for our evolution and continued existence."

STD stands for 'sexually TRANSMITTED disease'.  This means the virus or bacteria depends on the conditions present during sex to spread.\n\nIn a case like herpes simplex 2, the partner with the infection would have days when contact would be more dangerous.  The open sores on a penis would come into contact with the lining of the vagina and the virus would eventually work its way to her bloodstream.  No sexual contact, no problem.\n\nAll you can do is stay hygienic and know where your partner has been.  If in doubt, insist on condoms."

"2","Distinguish between insulin and estrogen?","","estrogen is a sex hormone, functioning as the primary female sex hormone, while insulin is a polypeptide hormone that regulates carbohydrate metabolism.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\nEstrogens' (also oestrogens) are a group of steroid compounds, named for their importance in the oestrus cycle, functioning as the primary female sex hormone. While estrogens are present in both men and women, they are usually present at significantly higher levels in women of reproductive age. They promote the development of female secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts, and are also involved in the thickening of the endometrium and other aspects of regulating the menstrual cycle. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) regulate the production of estrogen in ovulating women. Since estrogen circulating in the blood can feedback to reduce circulating levels of FSH and LH, some oral contraceptives contain estrogens.\n\nThe three major naturally occurring estrogens in women are estradiol, estriol and estrone. In the body these are all produced from androgens through enzyme action. Estradiol is produced from testosterone and estrone from androstenedione. Estrone is weaker than estradiol, and in post-menopausal women more estrone is present than estradiol.\n\nInsulin: \n, ""island"", as it is produced in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas) is a polypeptide hormone that regulates carbohydrate metabolism. Apart from being the primary effector in carbohydrate homeostasis, it also has a substantial effect on small vessel muscle tone, controls storage and release of fat (triglycerides) and cellular uptake of both amino acids and some electrolytes. In this last sense, it has anabolic properties. Its concentration (more or less, presence or absence) has extremely widespread effects throughout the body.\n\nInsulin is used medically in some forms of diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus depend on exogenous insulin (injected subcutaneously) for their survival because of an absolute deficiency of the hormone; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have either relatively low insulin production or insulin resistance or both, and a non-trivial fraction of type 2 diabetics eventually require insulin administration when other medications become inadequate in controlling blood glucose levels.\n\nInsulin has the empirical formula C257H383N65O77S6.\n\nSo essentially, tho they are both hormones, they play very different roles. Also, insulin is not typcally realted to one gender, while estrogen is mainly a female hormone (and therefore has feminising abilities)\nHope that helps you!"
"2","a question from relativistic mechanics..........?","imagine that i am travelling in a car at such a speed so that 5 minutes for me are equivalent to 100 years for the rest of the world. then how much fuel will my car consume???  fuel required for 5 minutes or for 100 years???.... coz for others i was travelling for 100 years but according to me i just travelled for 5 minutes,....  i am eagerly waiting for the answer... GIVE A COMPLETE EXPLANATION please..","The answer is very simple: the same amount of fuel is required no matter which reference frame you're in. Because it only takes you 5 minutes to travel from point A to point B, your fuel consumption rate will be significantly higher in your reference frame (remember consumption rate = amount of fuel burned/time) than someone measuring the rate in a stationary reference frame. The key points to remember is that total amount of matter and energy is the same no matter what reference frame you're in, but the passage of time is relative, and is dependent on your speed of motion.\n\nSo before you start your trip back to Earth, you must carry enough fuel to burn for 5 minutes, but you'll need to account for the relativistic effect, so you'll find that it is the same amount of fuel you'll need to burn for 100 years, according to someone in the stationary reference frame.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify these concepts for you!"

I think pre-diabetes is a misnomer cause not all pre-diabetics become diabetics.  By labeling someone pre-diabetic, doctors are trying to sort of warn them that they have a tendency to develop diabetes and they really should watch what they are eating and to loose so weight.\n\nThe criteria in diagnosising diabetes have changed over the years.  I think in the past a fasting sugar in the range of 150 was considered diabetic and there was a glucose intolerance catergory.  By changing the criteria and lowering the cutoff to 126, more people are being diagnosed with diabetes earlier.  And this is important because if you catch diabetes earlier and treat it eariler you will have less diabetic complications in the future.\n\nAgain this criteria does not apply to pregnancy.  The testing and criteria are different.\n\nTo answer you question,  no you do not have diabetes but you may have pre-diabetes.  Please continue to get annual or semi-annual  blood test with your doctor.  Watch yourself, exercise, eat right, don't gain to much weight cause you still may have a tendency towards diabetes.\n\nPlease look at this link from the American Diabetes Association.  Sugars from 101-125 are NOT NORMAL.\nhttp://www.diabetes.org/pre-diabetes/faq.jsp"

If scientists don't know what we do with the other ninety percent, it must be used for psychic powers!""

"3","how does smallpox work?","","""The disease is only moderately infectious, far less so than chickenpox. Unlike chickenpox, smallpox is not notably infectious in the prodromal period—viral shedding being delayed until the appearance of the rash. Smallpox transmission is a risk of prolonged social contact, direct contact with infected body fluids or contaminated objects. Infection in the natural disease will be via the lungs. The incubation period to obvious disease is around 12 days. In the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell, but around the 12th day, lysis of many infected cells occurs and the virus will be found in the bloodstream in large numbers. The initial or prodromal symptoms are essentially similar to other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold—fevers, muscle pain, stomach aches, etc. The digestive tract is commonly involved, leading to vomiting. Most cases will be prostrated.\n\nSmallpox virus preferentially attacks skin cells and by days 12–15, smallpox infection becomes obvious. The attack on skin cells causes the characteristic pimples associated with the disease. The pimples tend to erupt first in the mouth, then the arms and the hands, and later the rest of the body. At that point the pimples, called macules, should still be fairly small. This is the stage at which the victim is most contagious.\n\nBy days 15–16 the condition worsens—at this point the disease can take two vastly different courses. The first form is of classical ordinary smallpox, in which the pimples grow into vesicles, and then fill up with pus (turning them into pustules). Ordinary smallpox generally takes one of two basic courses. In discrete ordinary smallpox, the pustules stand out on the skin separately—there is a greater chance of surviving this form. In confluent ordinary smallpox, the blisters merge together into sheets which begin to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh—this form is usually fatal. If the patient survives for the course of the disease, the pustules will deflate in time (the duration is variable), and will start to dry up, usually beginning on day 28. Eventually the pustules will completely dry and start to flake off. Once all of the pustules flake off, the patient is considered cured."""
"3","can you get chlamydia without having sex?","","Chlamydia was discovered in the late 1970s and is neither a typical bacteria nor a virus. It is very small in size, like a virus, and has some characteristics of bacteria but can't manufacture its own energy the way bacteria or viruses can. Instead, it acts like a parasite, entering cells and using their energy. It is caused by an organism known as Chlamydia trachomatis, but it is not always easy to detect. Ten percent of the time, people who have chlamydia will test negative for it.\n\nChlamydia is one of the most common STDs in North America. In the sexually active eighteen to thirty crowd, 50 percent have chlamydia. Chlamydia is particularly nasty because it is asymptomatic. In one year, about 4.5 million women in North America will be infected with chlamydia, and 60 percent of them will not have any symptoms. The disease can do a lot of damage, though. Some experts estimate that chlamydia causes 50 percent of all pelvic infections and 25 percent of all tubal pregnancies due to scarring of the fallopian tubes. It can also cause urethral infections, cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix), and PID, which can lead to infertility or complications during pregnancy or birth.\n\nIn men, chlamydia can cause nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). Nongonococcal means the infection is not caused by gonorrhea; urethritis means inflammation of the urethra. If a man with NGU has sex with a healthy woman, she will probably get chlamydia. Finally, chlamydia can also cause proctitis, which is inflammation of the rectum.\n\nThe symptoms of early-stage chlamydia are usually nonexistent for four out of five women. The most common symptom, if any, is increased or abnormal vaginal discharge, which usually develops about fourteen days after infection. Sometimes a strong, rather foul vaginal odor develops as well. Painful urination, unusual vaginal bleeding, bleeding after sex, and low abdominal pain may also be signs, and the cervix may become inflamed (noticeable when you are examined by a doctor). If your cervix bleeds easily after a Pap smear, this is also a major clue. If chlamydia spreads to your uterus and fallopian tubes, it will have progressed to PID, and you may develop some of the symptoms discussed below.\n\nOne way to find out whether you have chlamydia is to ask your partner whether he has symptoms of NGU. Painful urination or urethral discharge that appear one to three weeks after infection are telltale signs. About 10 percent of the time, men show no symptoms of chlamydia either. Chlamydia can now be detected in men through a simple urine test. The best thing you can do if you're sexually active is to be regularly screened for chlamydia by your family doctor. The test is 90 percent accurate. The screening is simple: Your doctor takes a culture swab of cervical mucus. It can be done in conjunction with a Pap test. How regularly should you be swabbed? Every time you have a new partner. If you test negative but still suspect it, request antibiotic treatment for it anyway. Even if you are treated for nonexistent chlamydia, the treatment is relatively harmless to you, other than the mild side effects of antibiotics discussed below.\n\nNGU can also be caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum (T-Mycoplasma), another STD. Some practitioners feel that this can also cause PID in women. However, culturing for ureaplasma is very difficult. If your doctor suspects it, it's easier for him or her to just treat it and not bother culturing.\n\nThe good news about chlamydia is that it is extremely easy to treat: Tetracycline will cure both chlamydia and ureaplasma infections. The drug usually prescribed is called doxycycline (Vibramycin), a derivative of tetracycline (Achromycin and many other brands). Two doxycycline capsules per day for ten days will do the trick. Tetracycline is cheaper and must be taken four times a day, but many people forget to take that many pills; that's why the doxycycline is better. If you're pregnant or cannot be o"

"2","what is x/5 + y/5=3,3x + y=13 by using substitution method pls. show the solution and checking?","pls.......................... :D","okay first take x/5 + y/5 = 3 and times everything by 3 so you have 3x/5 + 3y/5=9 now times everything by 5 so you have 3x + 3y = 45 (notice the 5's on left side cancel when u mulitiply) now take \n3x + 3y = 45 and subtract the other equation from it which is 3x + y = 13 so it looks like this \n  3x + 3y = 45\n -3x -   y  =-13 which gives you \n  2y = 32 divide by 2 to get \n y=16 substitute this value of y in second equation ( 3x + y = 13)\nso you have 3x + 16 = 13 subtract 16 from both sides and you will have 3x = -3 divide by there and it gives you x = -1 now plug in both of you values x and y into one of the equations i say the second one because it's much easier but anyways when you plug it in the second one you get 3(-1) + 16 = 13 is this true and the answer is yes therefore it is solved correctly\n\nEDIT: Doin it again with a little more detail for my own sake lol\nEquation 1=  x/5 + y/5 = 3\nEquation 2=  3x + y = 13\n\n(x/5 + y/5 = 3) mulitiply everything in the ( ) by 3\n(3x/5 + 3y/5 = 9) multiply everything in the ( ) by 5\n3x + 3y = 45 notice the fives on the left side cancel\nNow subtract Equation 2 from 3x + 3y = 45\n   3x + 3y = 45\n   -3x - y= -13 so this will give you\n 0x + 2y = 32 divide by 2\n          y = 16 Substitute your y value into equation 2\n3x + y = 13 so you have instead 3x + 16 = 13 subtract 16 from both sides 3x = -3 divide both sides by 3 so you have x = -1 now plug in your x and y values into equation 2\n3(-1) + 16 = 13; -3 + 16 = 13; 16 - 3 = 13 which is correct therefore the solutions are correct"
"2","Why do we apply tin coating over brass?","","It is to stop reactions with organic products when cooking food. Brass is the term used for alloys of copper and zinc in a solid solution. It is more than 50% copper and from 5 to 20% zinc, in comparison to bronze which is principally an alloy of copper and tin. The copper in the alloy reacts with organic acids in the foodstuffs that can lead to food poisoning. The tin stops that from happening."

"2","if an ACh receptor is permanently blocked can external electrodes stimulate a contraction?","","I believe the external stimulation would trigger a contraction.  I am basing that on the fact that the muscle fibers are stimulated directly by the electrical current\nfrom the voltage source.\n\nRecruitment of fibers occurs opposite the standard.  Type II, fast twitch fibers, are recruited first and Type I, slow twitch, are second.  Normally the pattern is Type I then Type II when needed.\n\nThe change in charge at the muscle, which is a great conductor of electricity, causes the Ca++ release normally triggered by ACh or another neurotransmitter.\n\nCouldn't find a source to back me up, try an advanced physiology textbook. I did find this link below that has similar information."

"2","How does pitch (as in pitch you put on boats to keep them afloat) burn?","I know pitch does burn, but how does it burn?  Does it burn like an engulfing flame similar to gasoline, or is it just very hard to put out once it is on fire similar to oil?  Any insight would be appreciated.","Pitch that has been used for centuries (the ancient Greek and Romans used it and I am sure it was used before) is nothing more than tar.  The ancients probably found it in tar pit.  Tar is a petroleum product (basically it's like solidified crude oil).  As a result it will burn, not explosively but being a petroleum product once it gets going as in a fire ones going to have a heck of a time putting it out.  \n\nArchimedes was supposed to have invented a solar ray to aim at the Roman fleets to set the pitch on fire.  \n\nMythbusters did an episode on this one and concluded it would have been improbable, yet many still believe this story.\n\nI suspect because it is so flammable that today (unless one is making a replica of an older boat) it is not still used.  Perhaps it is in the 3rd world?  The American Indians used it on there birch bark canoes."
"3","Which is more effective?  The Pill or the shot (depo provera)?","","Both can kill you just as effectively. :(\nIf one must use hormonal contraception, I would opt for the one you can stop at will and has the smaller risk/number of side effects. The depro can't be countered once injected = you suffer the concequences no matter what they are for however long it takes your body to do it.\nThe Depro Shot is associated with more bone loss than menopause; twice as much as what occours with BCPs. It is associated with a wide variety of serious health complications including adrenal failure.\nALL hormonal contraceptives can cause HypoThyroid symptoms b/c the synthetic hormones suppress thyroid hormones. It has a similar problem with Diabetics."
"3","When to do surgery to diabetic patient with significant premacular or subhyaloid hemorrhage?","","Surgery in a diabetic patient is possible when Diabetes is well controlled by treatment or medication. All risk factors of that patient must be factored in; 1. controlling any heart disease. 2. controlling those bleeding factors, and having sufficient blood/plasma to replace blood loss during surgery.\nWill the outcome improve the chances of survival for the patient? That is the most important consideration of all. Always, always consider SURVIVAL. So, medical treatment is extremely important, don't ever forget, average life expectancy in the USA has significantly gone up DUE TO  Medical care. If there are doubts about that, consider the average life expectancy in Niger, for example. Women in Niger have a life expectancy of 35 years, due to (SADLY), lack of sufficient medical care."

What's the worst that could happen?","There is a huge difference in the rate that your blood pressure rises from running and a roller coaster. If you have a family you owe it to them not to take unnecessary risk for a cheap thrill."
"2","What is the most important hormone involved in water balance?","","Hormone Control of Water and Salt \nWater reabsorption is controlled by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in negative feedback. ADH is released from the pituitary gland in the brain. Dropping levels of fluid in the blood signal the hypothalamus to cause the pituitary to release ADH into the blood. ADH acts to increase water absorption in the kidneys. This puts more water back in the blood, increasing the concentration of the urine. When too much fluid is present in the blood, sensors in the heart signal the hypothalamus to cause a reduction of the amounts of ADH in the blood. This increases the amount of water absorbed by the kidneys, producing large quantities of a more dilute urine.\n\nAldosterone, a hormone secreted by the kidneys, regulates the transfer of sodium from the nephron to the blood. When sodium levels in the blood fall, aldosterone is released into the blood, causing more sodium to pass from the nephron to the blood. This causes water to flow into the blood by osmosis. Renin is released into the blood to control aldosterone."

If you don't tell her, it could be something that you will regret and will eat away at you, and from what you have said it is already really bothering you. Even though it could alter your friendship, you can't keep acting that you are only interested in her as a friend. Since you care about her so much to memorize a speech for her I don't think it is something that you can keep from her much longer, so go ahead and tell her. She has already told you that she is both a lesbian and bi, so I don't know how interested she will be but at least you will have told her and not keep asking yourself why you haven't done so yet."

Religion is a huge part of modern society, and to be ignorant of (or worse, prejudiced about!) it is to lack understanding of a key factor in today's world.  You just can't fully understand events in Iran, Saudi Arabia, India, England, Tibet, Israel, France, Norway, the United States, or a myriad of other nations if you don't understand religion.  As for which religions should be taught, it should naturally be all the major ones, not just Christianity."
"1","Why Atheism?","Why not believe in something besides yourself?","i think some people actually refuse to believe in God because they feel it makes them look less intelligent or weak, i know that believing in God doesnt mean you are dumb, but some feel that way. Some just cant get over the suffering and things on earth today, and believe that no God would allow that to happen. This is perfectly understandable,but if they only looked to the Bible to find the truth they would see the very real reasons for everything mankind is struggling with right now. When you dont have God, life is shallow, vain and shortlived,the world is a cold place, and God has put in place provisions for all of us to get out. If only people would give God a chance instead of following the crowd, imagine the difference it would make?\n\nOh and by the way ""Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld"" so you dont have to SEE something to have faith in it."

"2","How does a sedimentary rock become a metamorphic rock?","","Any rock (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic) can become a metamorphic rock. If rocks are buried deep in the Earth at high temperatures and pressures, they form new minerals and textures all without melting. If melting occurs, magma is formed, starting the rock cycle all over again. \nGeologists can learn the following about the Earth from the study of metamorphic rocks: \n\nthe temperature and pressure conditions (metamorphic environment) in which the rock was formed \nthe composition of the parent, or original unmetamorphosed, rock. \naids in the interpretation of the platetectonic setting in which the metamorphism took place \naids in the reconstruction of the geological history of an area. \nThe term ""metamorphic"" means ""to change form."" Changes in the temperature and pressure conditions cause the minerals in the rock to become unstable so they either reorient themselves into layers (foliation) or recrystallize into larger crystals, all without undergoing melting."

"2","Why do we always see the same side of the moon from earth?","","The earth exerts a powerful gravitational attraction for the moon (the moon also exerts a similar but lesser attraction for the earth that raises tides both in the ocean and to a lesser extent in the earth's crust that move about the earth as it spins).  The earth's attraction has raised a bulge in the moon facing earth that is therefore slightly closer to the earth and more strongly attracted.  If a huge meteor struck the moon (as in the past) trying to rotate it, it would have to overcome the earth's attraction for the bulge; thus the moon always faces its bulge toward the earth.  If the moon did spin at one time, the bulge would have helped arrest the motion relative to earth as it deleloped and froze solid."

"3","are avocados really good for you?","","Yes, Avocados are good for you, when eaten in moderation.\nA recommended serving size is 2 tablespoons, or roughly one-sixth of a medium-sized avocado. Each serving provides 5 grams of fat and 55 calories. Still, compared with butter or mayonnaise -- which each pack 22 fat grams and 200 calories in a 2-tablespoon serving -- they don't seem so bad.\nIt's true that avocados are high in fat -- one reason they've earned the nickname ""butter pear."" A medium-sized avocado contains 30 grams of fat, as much as a quarter-pound burger. That's why diet experts have long urged Americans to go easy on avocados in favor of less fatty fruits and vegetables. But now nutritionists are taking another look. They're finding that most of the fat in an avocado is monounsaturated -- the ""good"" kind that actually lowers cholesterol levels. Thanks to this new understanding, the U.S. government recently revised its official nutrition guidelines to urge Americans to eat more avocados.\nResearchers have also discovered that avocados are rich in beta-sitosterol, a natural substance shown to significantly lower blood cholesterol levels.\nThe USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2000 extols the value of fruits and vegetables in the diet and reports that avocados contain ""good"" unsaturated fats that do not raise blood cholesterol. Although the avocado is high in fat, 60% of the fat is monounsaturated, 20% is polyunsaturated, and 20% is saturated. The edible portion of an 8-ounce California avocado yields 30 grams of fat.\n\nNutritionally the avocado leads all other fruits in beta carotene and even exceeds the banana in potassium. While other fruits gain sugar as they ripen, the avocado's sugar content decreases as it matures. It contains more protein, potassium, magnesium, folic acid, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, vitamin E, and vitamin K per ounce than any other fruit.\n\nProof of the avocado's wealth of nutrition shows up in the USDA Nutrient Database. Though the avocado is calorie dense, (one-half cup pureed flesh contains 204 calories), the benefits outweigh the concern over its total fat content of 19.9 grams. That same one-half cup of pureed avocado packs a protein content of 2.4 grams with 3.1 grams of fiber.

"2","Frogs can be frozen, then unfrozen?","And they're still alive???\nReally?","The common wood frog freezes solid every winter and then, come spring, defrosts and mates. \n\nFrogs that survive freezing excite our imagination with visions of immortality. Underlining this excitement is the unexpected: our experience tells us that freezing kills. We've all read news stories of people who have lost fingers or toes to extreme cold, or even their lives. Thus, a whole animal that can survive freezing comes as a shock. Yet during the past two decades we have also read or even experienced the successes of in vitro fertilization, which involves the routine storage of sperm and embryos in a frozen state at cryogenic temperatures (-40°F or lower). So why is the survival of a frozen frog at 26°F surprising? \n\nThoroughly confused? You should be. Freezing has a yin-yang effect on biological materials—it can both preserve and destroy tissue. This paradoxical nature has led to two different fields of science and medicine built around freezing: cryopreservation and cryosurgery.\n\nSurviving the deep freeze\nLife is a complex set of electrochemical reactions. The rate at which chemical reactions take place depends on temperature, and usually the lower the temperature the lower the rate. At absolute zero Kelvin (-460°F), the rate is zero. Therefore, lowering the temperature of biological materials such as cells, organs, or entire organisms to absolute zero causes life to stop indefinitely. If a person or his or her body parts could survive the excursion to absolute zero and back, scientists and physicians could theoretically use such freezing as a vehicle to transport that person or parts to any point in the future. \n\nBecause we humans are mostly water, however, any journey into the supercool is physically traumatic. At about 31°F, the water in our bodies begins to freeze. It starts at this temperature (rather than 32°F) because biological water is in the form of a solution, mainly of ions or charged atoms. The survival of any cells during freezing depends at minimum on the rate the temperature changes. For most organisms, even the slowest cooling results in an assault on their cells that is just too great.\n\nResulting cell damage is related to the dissolved substances or solutes in biological water, to the cell membrane properties, and to the fact that ice has a very tight crystallographic structure and cannot contain solutes. When biological materials freeze, the solution between cells usually freezes first. Solutes found in the original solution are ejected and concentrated in the unfrozen space between the ice crystals. Cells usually remain unfrozen though supercooled.\n\nIn order to balance out the resulting difference in potential energy between the inside and outside of the cell, water leaves the cell through the cell membrane. Inside the cell, this loss of water causes an increase in the ionic concentration and leads to chemical damage. Interestingly, ions, not ice crystals, trigger cell injury during freezing. Theoretically, an infinitely fast rate to absolute zero would eliminate this harm. This is not possible, of course, and at higher cooling rates the supercooling of water in cells causes ice to form within those cells, which also brings about damage.\n\nNatural antifreezes\nCells in freeze-tolerant wood frogs experience the same mechanism of freezing injury as any other creatures' cells. The frogs freeze very slowly to a temperature often several degrees below freezing. This should destroy the frog's cells, yet those cells and the frog as a whole survive. How? A primary mechanism is through the production of glucose and its incorporation in the frog's cell. By lowering the amount of water that leaves the cell during freezing, the glucose offers protection against the rise in ionic concentration and excessive cell shrinkage, thereby reducing chemical harm.\n\nWhile the wood frog spent millions of years perfecting the use of such chemicals, scientists in the field of cryobiology disco"

"2","How and why do magnets attract? What kinds?","Im doing a project on magnets and i couldnt really find any USEFUL information on why magnets attract. HELP ME PLEASE? it would really help and i would appreciate it =)","Why do magnets work? \nMagnetism is an invisible force felt within the space around a magnet.  This space, called the magnetic field, can either attract (pull) or repel (push away) other magnets and some types of metal.\n\nAll magnets have two ends (poles).  These poles are opposites and are called the north and south poles.  Opposite poles attract, while like (similar) poles, repel.\n\nThe Earth’s core has its own magnetic field.  Magnetic north and south are near the geographic north and south poles.\n\nNASA has been experimenting with magnetic fluids for over 30 years. Magnetic fluids were made to help put fuel into a rocket engine. NASA was trying to solve the problem. of how to move fuel without gravity.  Tiny pieces of iron were put into the fuel. A magnet pulls the iron and could help get the fuel into the engine.\n\nMagnetic fluids are made by mixing pieces of metal in liquids to make a fluid that is very different from other liquids. It will stick to a magnet and can be directed by magnetic forces. Magnetic fields can shape the fluid, and magnetic fluids can change their thickness. They become hard around magnets.\n\nScientists have tried to use magnetic fluids to solve other problems. They’re used to make better computers. Scientists are still thinking of new ways to use the fluids.\n\nYou may use magnetic fluids!  Some cars have them in their shock absorbers. They are used in some buildings and bridges. The fluids help protect structures from damage from earthquakes or strong winds. There is still a lot to learn about these magnetic fluids. NASA is using the Space Station to learn more about them. They hope to find new ways to use them. \n\nKSNN thanks NASAexplores as a source of information.

"1","Why do ppl not believe in God because of the past?","I mean my parents are divorced, i was molested, my dad wants nothing to do with me, my mom was with an abusive boyfriend for 8 years and she almost died and had to have brain surgary and after all that i still found God and believe in him with all my heart.","There are of course many reasons why people choose to deny God. (I'm going to assume we are specifically referring to the God of the Christian/Jewish Bible).\n\nNow I realize that the reasons people choose to deny God not only depends on age, sex, and race, but also on the era and culture they grow up in. I will list some of the more practical and common reasons why I personally believe people today deny God referring specifically to people in America.\n\n1. Most people just don't care. It's true, most people don't care about the issue of God. They care more about their current needs and problems such as earning money, feeding their children, and surviving. So these types of people don't really care about belief in God because they don't see how having that ""belief"" will put food on the table.\n\n2. A lot of people grew up in traditional Catholic homes where the parents were harsh and strict and beat ""religion"" into their kids (not physically) and sternly commanded strict adherence to ""no sex,"" ""go to Church,"" ""do this and don't do that."" Of course when the children got old enough they completely rebelled, ditched Church, immediately started having lots of sex, hated religion, and cared only about the pleasures of this life. A further problem is that the parents teach the children to adhere and practice certain traditions without telling the children the meaning or importance of them. Naturally the children grow up believing these Church traditions are meaningless and useless and are angry that they had to follow them when they were younger. These types of people have felt “repressed” by religion for so long that they want little or nothing to do with it.\n\n3. Self-denial and the art of philosophy. A lot of people whether consciously or subconsciously deny that God exists and use lots of excuses to validate their denial. This is of course the position the NT holds in reference to how people willfully choose to deny God even though He clearly manifests Himself in the things that are seen (the intricate order of the universe, earth, life itself). They may choose to deny God by claiming that, “nothing is real,” “nothing can be proven,” “we can’t really tell if we even exist,” etc. You get the idea. Before anyone believes in God, for one reason or another they fall into this category, meaning that everyone has “inwardly” chosen rebellion and denial of God when we truly “know better.” This position only makes sense to those that are believers. These types of people deny God’s existence based on the fact that since we can never truly know what’s real or not, then nothing truly matters, including God.\n\n4. Sin is fun. If it wasn't people wouldn't do it. People like the temporary (and fleeting) high of sin. They of course gloss over and choose to deny the inevitable consequences (death, suffering, pain, etc.). But regardless, sin is quite tempting and it pays off (if only temporarily) and believing in God would mean they'd have to stop. Who would want to do that? These types of people reject God because everything He’s against feels too good to give up.\n\n5. Pop-culture. ""Rational,"" ""civilized,"" and ""educated"" minds have persuaded our culture, which inevitably persuaded our media, (which in turn persuaded our culture even more), that there is no absolute right or wrong, and that all of us are free to do what we ""feel"" is right and wrong. Once you take away absolute right and wrong God becomes a rather huge contradiction, and no one likes believing in a contradiction. Many religions are seen as “intolerant” and therefore are “narrow-minded.” If there are no absolutes, then God is not ""the"" truth. All religions are “up-for-grabs,” anything can be believed in whether it be paganism, the occult, philosophy, humanism, etc. Anything can be the truth, and th"

"3","Good Workout or a waste of time?","I've just started going back to the gym after a year(school ended and with it my gym membership).  I've been doing 45min-1hr of cardio(45min on a sitdwn bike 15min on a stair master) but I'm not outta breath and although naturally I don't sweat a lot, I'm barely sweating afterwards.  I'm 23 and reach the machine's pre-selected heart-rate of 153-158.  Am I getting any kind of work out at all, or just wasting an hour?  What cardio should I be doing? Haven't been working out for that long, so I'm not trying to run a marathon or anything.","If you're not sweating and you don't feel like your lungs are working hard you are probably not doing enough. You would be better off working out for 30 minutes at a higher intensity. Every body is different and I can't tell you what is going to work for YOU, but bottom line is you need to listen to your body. I would try maybe running, either on a treadmill or just on the street, and make sure you are working at a level appropraiate for you. Ignore the machine's readings. People get too caught up in that and they are so general. You need to raise your body temp enough to break a sweat and you need to be breathing hard enough that you can still carry on a conversation but feel like you would rather not. That's the rule that I use and it works for me."
"2","does heating basement  rid dampness as well as a dehumidifier?","","It may depend on the source and use of heat.  An electric heater would heat the air locally permitting the air to hold more moisture while perhaps drying some surfaces, but would not remove any moisture.  An existing circulation air heating system placed into service by opening duct vents would supply new dry air forcing moist air to move on perhaps returning to the furnace.  The basement may be damp because moisture penetrates the walls (possibly through cracks).  Therefore a dehumidifier or a central heating system may perform equally well compared to an electric heater unless the electrically heated warmed air is free to leave the area (perhaps rising up the stairs?)."
"2","If light is slowed... will it change from energy to mass?","Though according to theory of relativity.. light is constant and cannot be speeded or slowed...this question is purely theoretical...","When the light speeds up it gains mass, so it should loose mass when it slows down.\n\nSo you are right. Light has zero rest mass. So it will be as if it was non existant when its at rest. But we know when light hits any other particles it converts to energy and reveals its presense ( We humans also detect light with eyes, but its similar process of how objects get hot in summer with light ).\n\nNewton's Corpslcular theory can be very good classical explantion of mass/energy relation of light if every were normal classical photon. But we all know that Newton was wrong, and light will not change its direction slowly to conserve energy, but when it hits any smooth surface it retracts immediately. So its velocity at that point of hitting is zero for very very very short periods of time, and again its back to light speed. So your question does not have a classical or quantum explantion, but reltivity theory can be used to understand it."

Does he killed ?\n How he killed if he is the god? who his father is ?\nif he is the son of God why he is a human?\nmany question ?!!\nwhat is the clear story ????????","Jesus (8-2 BC/BCE– 29-36 AD/CE),[1] also known as Jesus of Nazareth, is the central figure of Christianity. In this context, he is known as Jesus Christ, where Christ is a Greek title meaning ""Anointed"", corresponding to the Hebrew term ""Messiah"".\n\nThe main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Most scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that Jesus was a Jewish teacher from Galilee who was regarded as a healer, was baptized by John the Baptist, was accused of sedition against the Roman Empire, and on the orders of Roman Governor Pontius Pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion.[2] As the Gospels were not written immediately after his death and there is little external documentation, a small minority of scholars question the historical existence of Jesus.[3]\n\nChristian views of Jesus (known as Christology) are both diverse and complex. Most Christians are Trinitarian and believe that Jesus is simultaneously the Son of God and God made incarnate, sent to provide salvation and reconciliation with God by atoning for the sins of humanity. Nontrinitarian Christians adopt various other interpretations regarding the divinity of Jesus. Most Christians believe that Jesus was born of a virgin, crucified and buried in a tomb[4], resurrected on the third day of death, and ascended into Heaven where he resides with God the Father until the Second Coming. Most Christians also believe that Jesus performed miracles and fulfilled biblical prophecy.\n\nIn Islam, Jesus (Arabic Isa) is considered one of God's most beloved and important prophets, a bringer of divine scripture, and also the Messiah. Muslims, however, do not share the Christian belief in the crucifixion or divinity of Jesus. Islam teaches that Jesus is alive in heaven and will return to the earth as Messiah in the company of the Mahdi once the earth has become full of sin and injustice.\n\nThe most detailed accounts of Jesus' birth are contained in the Gospel of Matthew (probably written between 65 and 90 AD/CE)[5] and the Gospel of Luke (probably written between 65 and 100 AD/CE).[6] There is considerable debate about the details of Jesus' birth even among Christian scholars, and few scholars claim to know either the year or the date of his birth or of his death. Based on the accounts in the Gospels of the shepherds' activities, the time of year depicted for Jesus' birth could be spring or summer. However, as early as 354, according to Origen, Roman Christians celebrated it following the December solstice in an attempt to replace the Roman festival of Saturnalia (or more specifically, Sol Invictus). Before then, Jesus' birth was generally celebrated on January 6 as part of the feast of Theophany, also known as Epiphany, which commemorated not only Jesus' birth but also his baptism by John in the Jordan River and possibly additional events in Jesus' life. The traditional date of Jesus' birth is celebrated as Christmas.\n\nIn the 248th year of the Diocletian Era (based on Diocletian's ascension to the Roman throne), Dionysius Exiguus attempted to pinpoint the number of years since Jesus' birth, arriving at a figure of 753 years after the founding of Rome. Dionysius then set Jesus' birth as being December 25 1 ACN (for ""Ante Christum Natum"", or ""before the birth of Christ""), and assigned AD 1 to the following year — thereby establishing the system of numbering years from the birth of Jesus: Anno Domini (which translates as ""in the year of our Lord""). This system made the then current year 532, and almost two centuries later it won acceptance and became the established calendar in Western civilization due to its championing by the Venerable Bede.\n\nHowever, based on a lunar eclipse that Josephus reports shortly before the death of Herod the Great (w"

We can only see fire in 3 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension.  When fire goes out, it expands into the dimensions we cannot see where it exists as a high energy plasma.  When you light a match, you are actually opening up a wormhole into those other dimensions.  The fire then expands into the the 3 spatial dimensions we can see."

"2","Which has a higher probability rate in a 52 card deck:  being  dealt 4 of a kind in succession or alternation?","Their is an arbitrary shuffle.  Successive is as it implies: being dealt  four cards in a row.  Alternating means one down, and then one to you. If it eases results, we are referring to the first four cards to be dealt in the Successive dealing and the first 8 in Alternating.  I've been pondering this question assuming a simple answer but I haven't reached a conclusion to date.  If you are going to answer it for points please write something ridiculous to make me laugh.  I'd prefer humor over the words ""Succession"" or  ""Alternation.""","Think of the probability of picking 4 cards from somewhere in the deck and finding them all the same... it would be something like (52/52 x 3/51 x 2/50 x 1/49).  But whatever it is, it doesn't matter.  Just call this probability p.  Now does it matter where you draw the cards from?  If I were to pick the first 4 cards, the last 4 cards, a random collection of cards, alternating cards, etc. will the results be any different?  No, the probability is always the same probability p.\n\nIt's the same with the lottery.  While the sequence 1,2,3,4,5 might seem less likely to occur than something like 13, 17, 26, 37, 42, they actually have the same probability.\n\nHowever, you may notice that dealers always deal one card to each player, then repeat.  They don't deal 5 cards to one, then 5 cards to another, etc.  The reason has nothing to do with probability and everything to do with preventing cheating. It's much easier to perhaps keep a set of cards together while shuffling (with false shuffles, palming, etc.) and then make sure they get placed at the top of the deck.  Then if you dealt them to one person, they'd get all the desirable cards.  However, if you have to alternate, then it is near impossible to arrange the cards so that one person gets the desirable cards."
"2","Why is the ocean salty ?","","The ocean is essential for life on Earth, and also helps make the climate fairly moderate. However, although the ocean contains 1,370 million cubic kilometres (334 million cubic miles) of water, humans can’t survive by drinking from it—it is too salty.\n\nTo a chemist, ‘salt’ refers to a wide range of chemicals where a metal is combined with a non-metal. Ordinary common salt is a compound formed when the metal sodium combines with the non-metal chlorine—sodium chloride. This contains electrically charged atoms, called ions, that attract each other, resulting in a fairly hard crystal. When salt dissolves, these ions separate. Sodium and chloride ions are the main ions in seawater, but not the only ones. The salty seas benefit man, because the ocean provides many useful minerals for our industries."

"2","why do cockroaches die on their backs?","i just noticed. everytime we use insecticide, we see dead cockroaches die that way.","A couple of reasons:\nRoaches cannot flip themselves back onto thier stomach once they flipped onto thier back, and so a flipped roach will eventually die. This is because in nature roaches would live on surfaces that are not as smooth as the kitchen floor, and will have some kind of bumps in the ground that could help them flip back. \nSecond reason is that pestocides contain nerve poisen, and when the roach is poisened, it will have muscle spasms, that will cause it to flip. \nBy the way, roaches die of pestocides because they are actually clean creatures. The pestocide will stick to thier feet, and they will lick it off and that's how they get poisened."
"2","How i can generat 3D triangulation model from arial Photos?","I've got a 60CM resolution photo with X,Y according to wgs84 and i wanna generate the 3d tria. i have Arc info but it is unable to generate 3d surface","I'm not familiar with your data.  However, human eyes see 3D because there is space between the eyes and the two views are therefore slightly different, especially for nearby objects.  You can ""see"" 3D using arial photography if two pictures are take in rapid succession from the airplane with enough separation to simulate the space between eyes.  The space must be much greater for the airplane because the objects on the ground are far away from the camera lense.  Set the photos side by side with a vertical sheet (of cardboard?) between them and look down on the photos using both eyes.  If the size of the photos and placement are correct so that your eyes now simulate the airplane, you may be able to fuse the images into 3D.  Often special equipment (and lenses?) are used to facilitate the process.  Good luck."

"3","My daughter has been diagnosed with Mersa (a type of staff infection) what information do you have on it?","She has been hospitalized twice for this.","I'm sorry, but the above post is misleading.  You are most likely refering to MRSA, or Methicillin-Resistant Staph Aureus.  Regular Staph aureus is a common skin bacteria that is sensitive to many antibiotics.  That is the one that is present in everyone.  About twenty years ago a strain of staph aureus evolved resistance to most antibiotics, including methicillin.  Hence the name MRSA.  MRSA is NOT present on everyone, but rather is contracted either in hospital or in the community.  \n\nThe are two basic MRSA issues.  One can be infected with it (meaning the bacteria gets into the body and starts causing serious problems), or one can simply have it found on the skin (so called colonization).  So the first issue is whether your daughter is colonized or infected.  Colonization may not need any treatment, while infection needs IV antibiotics.  Work with your doctor on this issues and if she had been already hospitalized twice, make sure you have an infectious diseases specialist on board.\n\nThis is an ok site about it:\nhttp://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/mrsa.htm\n\nGood luck!"

"2","why does it happen to be that an integral is also an antiderivative?","","In basic calculus, we use the derivative to find the slope of a curve, and the integral to find the area under a curve.  The question is, why are these operations the opposite of each other?\n\nThe quick answer is:  The derivative is used to calculate the rate of change of a function.  And the rate of change of the area under a curve is actually the original function.\n\n\nLet's say you have a simple curve, y=f(x).\n\nThe derivative of the function is gives you the rate of change of that function.  As x increases by 1, how much does y change?  That's also known as the slope.\n\n[And you probably know that the derivative of the derivative is also useful.  That's the rate of change of the slope.  When the slope stops changing (or its rate of change=0), it's at a maximum, minimum, or point of inflection.]\n\nThe same relationship exists for the area under a curve and the function itself.  You probably learned to think of the integral of f(x) as the sum of the thin vertical strips under the curve.  That's the area under the curve.  As you move to the right, how fast does the area grow?  You're essentially adding these vertical strips to the area.  The length of a vertical strip is f(x), or the original function.  So the original function f(x) represents how fast the area grows for any value x.\n\n\nETA: What do I have to do to get selected as best answer?"

"1","are we all reincarnated, or are some of us 'new' souls?","","Most answers to this type of question are based on belief but there are a few ""Master"" enlightened beings that claim to actually know the answers.  So based on what I've read and come to believe all ""souls"" come from an unconscious God state and are actually an individual mind of God on a journey of consciousness veiled by the bubble of illusion (our existence).  This is a continuous, infinite process from what I understand.  Meaning ""new souls"" are continually coming from the original God state.  The individual ""soul"" goes through the process of evolution of forms until it reaches the human form.  So there are some humans that have never been human before but they have had millions of life times and probably in their last life they were a dog.  Then the ""soul"" goes through the process of reincarnation of human forms because of karmic debt, etc."
"2","How do astrophysicists calculate the exact distance of other celestial objects from earth?","","There are three basic methods:\n\n1. Parallax. The angle at which the object appears in the sky is very precisely measured at one point in the Earth's orbit, then measured again six months later. Since the Earth is in a different position at these times (186 million miles between the two measurments), the star will appear at slightly different angles, and its distance can then be worked out from these angles using simple trigonometry.\n\n2. Standard candles. Certain types of stars (Cepheid variables, RR lyrae variables), and certain types of stellar events (type Ia supernovae), have luminosities that can be worked out fairly precisely from their intrinsic properties (the variable stars for instance, have a period of variablility that is closely correlated with their luminosity, and the type Ia's luminosity can be worked out by examining its light curve). Since percieved luminosity varies inversely with the square of the distance, and since we konw how much light they put out at the source, we can work out how far away these stars are simply by measuring how bright they are.\n\n3. Redshift. The universe is expanding, and that means that from our perspective, distant galaxies are all moving away from us. This means that the light we recieve from them will be at a lower frequency (that is, redder) than the light they emitted, due to the doppler effect. Edwin hubble discovered that at large scales, the observed redshift is directly proportional to the distance of the object from us. This means that if the object is too far away to measure using parallax and lacks a good standard candle, we can still determine its distance simply by measuring its velocity. Actually doing this is somewhat difficult, and involves looking for patterns in the absorption lines in the object's spectrum to figure out what elements created those lines, and then one you know that you can figure out what the frequency of the light should be. After that, you have to work to filter out as many extraneous sources of redshift as possible, such as the object's gravity, its velocity due to gravitational interactions with other nearby objects (what is called the peculiar velocity), and so forth, to leave just the velocity due to the expansion of the universe - from which the distance is estimated using hubble's law."

"1","what are the names of the leaders in world war 2?","eg: Hitler,Churchill","Adolf Hitler - Nazi dictator of Germany (1933-45), planned and started World War 2, committed suicide at the end of the war. \nGeneral Hideki Tojo - Prime minister of Japan (October 1941 - July 1944). With a long militarist tradition, Japan became extremely militarist and aggressive in the 1930s and was practically governed by military leaders. Tojo, an aggressive army General, became minister of war in July 1941 and prime minister in October 1941. After a short attempt to improve relations with the US failed, he ordered to go to war and attack Pearl Harbor in December 1941. He gradually took more ministerial roles, and in Feb. 1944 also made himself the commander in chief, like Adolf Hitler did. When he realized that Japan was going to lose the war he resigned. The military continued to control Japan until the end of World War 2, which came when the Emperor Hirohito which was until then passive, ordered to surrender in order to prevent further inevitable destruction of Japan. After the war Tojo was executed for his responsibility to Japan's war crimes. \nBenito Mussolini, was the prime minister of Italy (1922-1943). A former journalist, he went to politics and formed the Fascist party, whose ideology, Fascism, called for a one-party state, total obedience, patriotic nationalism, and aggressive militarism. The ideology and its implementation in Mussolini's Italy influenced Adolf Hitler's own ideology, Nazism, which was a combination of Fascism with extreme racism. Initially Mussolini led a right-wing coalition, but later Italy became a one party state. His treatment of unemployment made Mussolini popular, but the military aggression of Fascism led to its failure. Mussolini was eager to demonstrate the ""strength"" of his regime by invading weaker neighbors. In 1935 he invaded and occupied the peaceful Ethiopia from Italy's nearby colony in East Africa. In 1936, the two Fascist dictators, Hitler and Mussolini, signed an alliance. In 1939 he invaded and occupied his small neighbor Albania, and Mussolini then enhanced his alliance with Hitler to a full military alliance. Mussolini knew that his military was not very effective, but when the Germans defeated the French and British forces in mid 1940 he thought it was safe enough for him to attack Britain and the collapsing France too and declared war, and in October 1940 he also invaded Greece, and was repelled. Mussolini had a million soldiers in Libya, and he sent them to attack the small British force in Egypt. The Italian Navy and Air Force attacked British ports and shipping in the Mediterranean, from Gibraltar in the West to Haifa (Israel) in the East. Despite its numerical strength and the fact that British forces in the Mediterranean were greatly outnumbered and very stretched, the Italian military could not defeat them anywhere, and was severely beaten by the British, and simply had to call for the help of the much more capable Germans. Even with German help, the British forces only lost their positions in Greece and kept fighting fiercely from their island bases in Malta, Gibraltar, and in North Africa. Mussolini's Italy became a German puppet, and even sent troops to participate in Germany's invasion of Russia. Eventually, British and American forces eliminated the Italian and German forces in North Africa and followed in July 1943 with an invasion of Sicily in South Italy. It was clear that Italy was losing the war, so several days after the invasion Mussolini was replaced and arrested in a remote mountain castle. Hitler sent commandos to rescue his friend from captivity. In April 1945, when German defence in North Italy collapsed, Mussolini was captured by Italian partisans and executed . \nThe defenders\nWinston Churchill kept warning of the Nazi danger in pre-war years. He was elected prime minister of Great Britain after the total collapse of the appeasement policy of his predecessor Neville Chamberlain. Chamberlain failed to understa"

There are serious side effects, and the doctors usually require regular blood work while taking it.  You can't take it if you're pregnant, and a doctor will often make sure you are on birth control before prescribing it.  Maybe you're case isn't that serious, but you should talk to your doctor if you think it might be."

"3","I want to know more on impotence due to diabetis?","","In men\n\n      Long-term diabetes can cause damage to the nervous system, which is involved in the complex process of erection.\n\n      This means men with diabetes may suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED) and be unable to get or maintain an erection. As many as a third of men with diabetes experience ED.\n\n      \n      Term watch\n      Erectile dysfunction is another name for impotence.\n      Some men only discover they have diabetes when they seek treatment for their erectile dysfunction.\n\n      Once diabetes has been regulated through diet, pills or insulin injections, sexual problems usually disappear and the ability to get an erection is restored.\n\n      In women\n\n      A number of women with diabetes may suffer from recurring vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina), which is usually due to yeast infection. This makes sex painful. You may suffer itching or burning sensations.\n\n      Women with diabetes may also get recurring cystitis.\n\n      There is also some suggestion that women with diabetes have problems with arousal, and just as the penis fails to become erect in the man, the clitoris in a woman may not respond to stimulation in the normal way.\n\nCan you make your sex life work when you have diabetes?\n\nIf you feel diabetes is causing problems with your sex life, talk to your doctor.\n\nWhile no-one relishes talking about sexual problems with a doctor, these issues can only be addressed if you seek help.\n\nYour doctor will try to find out whether sexual problems are caused by defects in the nervous or circulatory system as a result of the diabetes, or whether they are of a more psychological nature. Often this distinction is difficult to make.\n\nIn any case, when sexual dysfunction begins to happen on a regular basis it tends to get worse unless it is properly treated, so the psychological element inevitably builds up.\n\nAn increasing number of men who have diabetes and ED are being helped by medicines such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).\n\nIf tests confirm that your nervous system hasn't been damaged by diabetes, and there are no associated circulatory problems, there's no reason why your sex life shouldn't recover.\n\nSometimes a little help and support from your partner and doctor is all that's needed.\n\nWhat can be done about sexual problems that are not caused by diabetes?\n\nThis is a sensitive issue, but help is available.\n\nGenerally the most useful first port of call is your family doctor, who can refer you (and your partner) to a psychosexual therapist - or marriage guidance counsellor if this is more appropriate.\n\nTry not to dwell on the fact diabetes can cause sexual problems - just because it can, doesn't mean it will.\n\nAnd if you do experience difficulties, be reassured that nowadays there is a lot of help available."

Could astronauts last that long in flight and have enough room for provisions? Would this ever be possible? How fast would the space capsule have to be traveling? I know we have landed several unmanned spacecraft, but each trip was one way only.","Yes, we have the technology to do this now.  What's holding us back is the cost, not the tech.\n\nThe trip would be about six months each way using the engines we have now and gravity assists where possible.  The most likely scenario would be to first launch a series of un-manned ""provision"" ships to land on Mars or perhaps orbit it -- these would contain food, water, and fuel.  Once we had verified that they were safely at their destination, we would launch the manned ship -- which would carry enough provisions for a one-way trip, and upon arrival at Mars re-stock from the earlier unmanned ships and then return to Earth.  \nWe *could* fully provision a ship for a round-trip, but doing so makes the manned craft much larger and expensive, and lacks the backup of additional supplies existing at the destination.\n\nAll of this is already on NASA's drawing boards, though whether it will ever happen or not is completely a matter of $$ :)"

Some of the changes are obvious: nights would be darker, and tides would be lower (but not nonexistent; the sun's gravitational pull on the earth would still generate tides, though they would only be about a third as high as those created by the moon and the sun together). Other changes are more surprising: over time, the moon's tidal drag has acted as a brake on the earth's rotation; without it, Comins estimates, the earth would spin as much as three times faster, so that a year on earth-without-a-moon would consist of 1,095 eight-hour days. This faster spin would in turn result in near-constant hurricane-force east-to-west winds. The increased sloshing of the earth's molten core would generate a stronger magnetic field, deflecting more of the solar wind and possibly altering the chemistry of the earth's atmosphere."
"2","tangent line of an ellipse!?","find tangent line of ellipse x^2+4y^2=5 at (-5,0) and find (x1,y1) where the tangent line intersects the ellipse!","Use implicit differentiation to find dy/dx. Standard differentiation rules apply, except when you differentiate a term with a ""y"" in it you must tack on a dy/dx, so:\n\n2x+8y(dy/dx)=0\ndy/dx = -x/4y\n\nThe tangent line intersects the ellipse at (x1,y1), so the slope of the tangent line will be -x1/(4*y1).\n\nWe can also compute the slope of the tangent line by plugging the two points (-5,0) and (x1,y1) into the standard slope formula m = delta(y)/delta(x) and get that the slope of the tangent line is y1/(x1+5). Since these expressions both describe the slope of the tangent line, they must be equal, so\n-x1/(4*y1)=y1/(x1+5)\nx1^2+5*x1=-4*y1^2\nx1^2+4*y1^2+5*x1=0\n\nSince (x1,y1) is a point on the ellipse, it must satisfy the equation of the ellipse, so x1^2+4*y1^2=5. Substituting this in to x1^2+4*y1^2+5*x1=0 gives us 5+5*x1=0, and x1=-1. At this point, there are actually two y1 values that will satisfy the equation of the ellipse, y1 could be either plus or minus 1 (get these by letting x=-1 in the original equation of the ellipse), and so there are actually two points on the ellipse where the tangent line passes through (-5,0), and those points are (-1,1) and (-1,-1)."

I have been using that as a sweetner for tea, bagels, etc. My symptoms include heartburn, nausia, etc. I know mylanta will help, but I'm looking for the root problem. Thanks","Modern medicine is only just learning of this fact. Traditional uses of honey have included honey mixed with lemon for sore throats. Honey coats the throat and reduces throat irritation. Research has already shown that honey blocks the growth of oral bacteria. Honey has also been used for stomach pains and problems. Modern research shows that honey is effective when used in the treatment of gastric or peptic stomach ulcers. Research has also revealed that honey is effective in the treatment of various wounds and infections because of its antimicrobial (antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal) properties. \n\n\nResearchers are not absolutely sure why honey heals but they are learning new things about honey everyday. We do know that honey contains a variety of sugars and minerals. Honey is also considered an antioxidant. This means it allows the blood to circulate better and provide more oxygen to areas of the body such as the brain. Honey can also be used externally to promote healing when applied to wounds, even postoperative wounds. Honey has also been effective in its use to treat burns. It has even been shown to be low in calories and useful as a sweetener for diabetics, people with heart disease or those overweight. \n\n\nAlthough there is healing in honey for a variety of medical disorders, certain precautions should be taken. If you have any known allergies to specific plants, then you should make sure the honey you are using is not made from that plant. People with allergies to bee stings should be careful when using other bee-related broducts such as propolis or royal jelly. If these precautions are followed, then honey may provide healing for you."

Do your cardio on an empty stomack, this will cause your body to directly target fat deposites for energy but you have to eat within 10 minutes after your workout or your body will seek protiens which would be bad because the more muscle you have (Even a little) the more calories you burn when doing nothing.\n\nDo the cardio at least 3 times a week for 30 to 60 minutes (Do not exceed 60 minutes unless you do it twice a day 60 each). Purchase a HRM (See link) this will make your heart rate show up on any polar compatable machine (Most are compatable). Keep your heart rate at in the fat burning zone or higher. Higher will burn more calories hence more fat but just no as efficiently, i.e. the percentage of carbs burned with increase as your intensity rises.\n\nSwitch some of the things in your died. Throw out all of your bread and buy Ezekiel bread. Limit your dairy, choose brown rice and sweet potatoes as opposed to the regular types. Stop eating junk food and snacks and hold your breath when driving by fast food resturaunts lol.\n\nThe most effective way to burn fat and furm up is to incorporate some form of resistance training into your workout. You would actually see more results if you cut back on your cardio to 4 or 5 times a week and hit the wieghts 3 times per week. Speak with a certified fitness trainer, they will set you in the right directions. \n\nGood luck."

"3","what are some of marijuana's effects right when you're smoking it?","","It largely depends on the individual and their immediate environment.  The most notable effects are an absence of physical pain along with a heightened sense of your environment and your senses.  It is possible the first time you smoke marijuana you will not experience anything at all.  This is often reported though I don't know the scientific reason for it.  If you feel safe in your environment you will notably relax and be able to connect intellectually with others in a more intimate way.  People tend to ""open up"" when they smoke marijuana.  Shortly after smoking it you will experience a dry mouth and a thirst.  Food and drink become more enjoyable because of your heightened sense of smell and taste.  Some people can become anxious if they are in an environment that doesn't feel or isn't safe.   Anxiety can also come about if your overly preoccupied with a negative or stressful situation.  The perceived magnitude of your dilemma can be exaggerated in your mind.  Largely marijuana allows you to relax, re leaves pain very effectively, enhances your enjoyment of simple things usually overlooked.  It can make you become involved in T.V. or Movies more than usual because of an increase in your ability to focus or ""be in the moment"".  It's important to be with friends you trust and in an environment that is pleasurable to some extent to begin with.  Some people claim an increase in sex drive probably due to heightened senses but you care free disposition could lead to poor choices if acted upon.  Often after the initial high, say 2 hours, you may feel unusually bored or apathetic.  In short... no pain, relaxation, increased hunger and thirst, a feeling of connection to others, possible paranoia, increased enjoyment of immediate surroundings and dry mouth."

"3","Alzheimer's affects which part of the brain?","","Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease, is the most common cause of dementia and characterized clinically by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. The most striking early symptom is memory loss (amnesia), usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), recognition (agnosia) and those functions (such as decision-making and planning) closely related to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain as they become disconnected from the limbic system, reflecting extension of the underlying pathological process. This consists principally of neuronal (cell) loss (or atrophy), together with an inflammatory response to the deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles."
"1","Is this adultery?","if I often think about having sex with my engaged one... we never do it-- we're saving it for marriage. It doesn't feel wrong when I think about it, but I just wondered if it was adulterous. Please be practical if you are going to use theology. Thanks.","Jesus said that to look after a woman to lust you've already committed adultery with her in your heart.  The point of this is that Christ is more interested in what we are rather than what we do.  In other words, if its wrong to do a particular thing, it is wrong to fantasize about doing it, because whatever is in a person's  heart is what will flow out of him or her and defines him or her.  The practical side of this is, God knows how strong sexual desires are.  They have th power to drown out everything else.  They can reach a fever pitch almost instantly.  However, they are the weakest of all the qualities in a relationship to hold it together through the trials of life and ultimately, old age, sickness, and death.  That's why you need to cool the flame of sexual energy to allow the foundation to form that will carry you two together for life; love him for the person he is, the friend that he is.  Let sex (after marriage) spring from a beautiful union that has already grown and matured and as a special bonus.  God came up with the idea of sex, but He hates to see a great thing spoiled.  That's why He has rules for things; not to kill our fun, but for our good.  If sex is the foundation it will wither away.  Lastly, give your heart to Christ (if you haven't already) and call out His name for help when this becomes impossible because you can't do this in your own strength."

If this is Jehovah saying this, when did Jehovah ever die?","All three times the title ""Alpha and Omega"" is used in Revelation, \nAlmighty God Jehovah is the 'speaker'. In actuality, nowhere is the bible is ""Alpha and Omega"" mentioned as dying.\n\nThe oldest Greek manuscripts, such as Alexandrine, Sinaitic, and Codex Ephraemi rescriptus, show that the KJV's use of the term at Revelation 1:11 is spurious. A small handful of other translations dishonestly insert the name ""Jesus"" at Rev 22:12 or Rev 22:13 but secular scholars unanimously agree that the most reliable ancient manuscripts never had Jesus' name there. Revelation 22:13 discussed Jehovah the Father.\n\nIn contrast to the Greek philosophy, pagan tradition, dishonest scholarship, and tortured ""logic"" of trinitarianism, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Scriptures alone quite plainly demonstrate that Jesus and the Almighty are separate distinct persons, and the Almighty created Jesus as His firstborn son.\n\n(Colossians 1:15) the firstborn of all creation\n\n(Mark 10:18) Jesus said to him: 'Why do you call me good?

"1","how important is to to have faith in any religion?","","I have problems with ""faith"".  Faith is essentially asking you to believe something that defies logic, science, reason, experience.  This is the one hook that the church must have in order to keep the good believers believing.\n\nOtherwise, if people started thinking and questioning the dogma of their church and the very existence of God and the truth about Jesus, then they might stray away from the Church.\n\nWithout faith, then people may have to start thinking for themselves and develop their own spiritual path without being told what and how to do it."

There is nothing that goes against it or points to a different way to scientifically explain modern diversity. There is not one fossil or one piece of DNA that does NOT point to evolution. It would be hard NOT to see the concrete evidence, and only those blinded by faith can do this.\n\nEvolution is 100% world-wide accepted fact, including the evolution of man.\n\nThere is ZERO evidence for a higher being causing anything. This is why people who are religious need faith, you can't see or study the actions of a deity, by definition. Evolution has ZERO faith and ALL evidence.\n\nScientists (real ones) have been studying and supporting evolution for over 150 years, and still nothing has pointed to creationism. There is clear links and transitional forms between everything in the fossil record to the Class-Family level, if not Genus-Species level. And this includes humans, which there are several 'missing links' which are well described and studied, people just choose to ignore this. Sure, there are still things we don't know, but that's why science is not stagnent and dead. We learn more every day, that's what happens when you keep an open mind and follow the scientific method.\n\nThere are some areas of evolution in which all of the pieces have not been found in the fossil record, but there is no counter theory that has even ONE piece of evidence that can not easily be explained by evolution.\n\nLet me turn the question around, if Creationism was correct and science could definitively prove Creationism (and thus the existence of God), why would they not? That would be the greatest scientific discovery in the history of the world. No one would pass that up to maintain the 'status quo'. There is no conspiracy to hide creation evidence. Anyone who knows real scientists knows they are glory-mongers first. They love to prove others wrong to enhance their own standing. And if any scientist could prove Creation/God, it would've been done a long time ago.\n\nGo to a museum, take a class in biology, go to reputable sites on the Internet (like AAAS: http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution or http://www.talkorigins.org ) and find out for yourself."

Each behaves like a capacitor and traps charge underneath it in the semiconductor. When it is exposed to light, the light helps some of the charge to leak away - more light more leakage.\n\nBut the clever bitis that the transistors are effectively linked to each other through the properties of the semiconductor in such a way as a voltage can be applied to move the chage from one transistor to its neighbour. It called a charge coupled device.\n\nSo before you take a pic the camera loads the same amount of charge under each transistor. Then it exposes them to light. Then it repeatedly applies a voltage to get out each packet of charge and measure it, one at a time (well, a row at a time). Then it stores the resulting values."

What is the panda's adaptation for escaping preditors? and three other interesting facts? please give sources. If u want to send it to me in an email at sabrinaelkarmouty@yahoo.com","The giant panda is a national treasure in China and is therefore protected by law. This unique bear has long been revered by the Chinese and can be found in Chinese art dating back thousands of years. The Chinese call their beloved pandas ""large bear-cats."" People outside of China have been fascinated by giant pandas since they were first described by French Missionary Pere Armand David in 1869. Now, more than 100 years later, the worldwide love for pandas has been combined with international efforts to keep them from becoming extinct.\n\nFor years scientists have wondered whether pandas are bears, raccoons, or in a group all their own. Through studying the genetic code (DNA) in pandas’ cells, scientists have confirmed the panda's relationship with bears. Giant pandas are similar to other bears in their general looks, the way they walk and climb, and their skull characteristics. It's important to know that pandas are bears, because the more we know about pandas, the better we can help them reproduce and survive.\n\nGiant pandas are only about the size of a stick of butter at birth, and they're hairless and helpless. The panda mother gives great care to her tiny cub, usually cradling it in one paw and holding it close to her chest. For several days after birth, the mother does not leave the den, not even to eat or drink!\n\nYet despite the attention they receive from their mothers, many young pandas do not survive. Through captive propagation programs in China and other zoos around the world, we are learning more about the care of panda cubs and how to help them reach adulthood. \n\nBamboo is the most important plant in a giant panda's life. Pandas live in cold and rainy bamboo forests high in the mountains of western China. They spend at least 12 hours each day eating bamboo. Because bamboo is so low in nutrients, pandas eat as much as 84 pounds (38 kilograms) of it each day. Pandas grasp bamboo stalks with their five fingers and a special wristbone, then use their teeth to peel off the tough outer layers to reveal the soft inner tissue. Strong jaw bones and cheek muscles help pandas crush and chew the thick stalks with their flattened back teeth. Bamboo leaves are also on the menu, as pandas strip them off the stalks, wad them up, and swallow them. Giant pandas have also been known to eat grasses, bulbs, fruits, some insects, and even rodents and carrion. At the San Diego Zoo, pandas are offered bamboo, carrots, yams, and special leaf eater biscuits made of grain and packed with all the vitamins and minerals pandas need.\n\nToday, only around 1,600 giant pandas survive on Earth. There are several reasons why pandas are endangered:\n\nLow reproductive rate— Pandas like to be by themselves most of the year, and they have a very short breeding season when a male will look for a female to mate with. Females give birth to one or two cubs, which are very dependent on their mothers during the first few years of life. In the wild, mother pandas will care for only one of the young. In panda facilities in China, keepers help to hand raise any twin cubs. One baby is left with the mother and the keepers switch the twins every few days so each one gets care and milk directly from the mother.\n\nBamboo shortages— When bamboo plants reach maturity, they flower and produce seeds, and then the mature plant dies. The seeds grow slowly into plants large enough for pandas to eat. Giant pandas can eat 25 different types of bamboo, but they usually eat only the 4 or 5 kinds that grow in their home range. The unusual thing about bamboo is that all of the plants of one species growing in an area will bloom and die at the same time. When those plants die, pandas move to another area. But now, with humans taking up much of the panda’s habitat, pandas are often unable to move to another area and may face starvation.\n\nHabitat destruction— China has more than one billion people. As people build more cities and farms "

Personally, it grieves me to see people embrace irrationality like this, but unless someone actually wants to work in biology, how much harm does a belief in creationism do in practical terms?","I agree with mainwoolly (and not for the first time); I suspect that nonsensical beliefs of all kinds actually have a real-world, real-time effect, on the human mind if nothing else.\n\nWe all know people who never make a decision without first performing a tarot card reading, or faithfully check their horoscopes every day, or whatever.  They simply do not hear you when you point out that it's a pile, no, a truckload, nay, a Matterhorn of horse-hockey.  These same people retain enough sense to enable them to pass their drivers' license tests; to get and hold jobs; to raise children who stay out of prison (the majority of them, at any rate).  \n\nAnd they never notice the contradiction, they never notice that their own brains are divided against them.  It's like walking around with a big ole ugly-a$$ nine-hundred-pound gorilla perched on your shoulder.  I've never studied psychology so I can't understand how or why this works for anyone; but apparently it does.\n\nHow much might more have been accomplished already if so many of us weren't permitting ourselves to be held back in this way?  It doesn't bear thinking about, really."

Individuals who suffer a heart attack despite having normal or even low cholesterol levels are often found to have high levels of homocysteine. Since high homocysteine levels are signficantly associated with increased risk of heart attack and stroke, having a good supply of vitamin B6 on hand makes a great deal of sense. High intakes of vitamin B6 have also been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nVery high levels of vitamin B6 can damage sensory nerves, leading to numbness in the hands and feet as well as difficulty in walking; supplementation should be stopped if these symptoms develop after beginning vitamin B6 supplementation. Vitamin B6 is usually safe in amounts of 200 to 500 mg per day, although occasional problems have been reported in this range. Higher amounts are clearly toxic"

"1","how old was u when u know u was gay?","","i think i have always known. i had never had any interest in girls. Even as a young young child i was fascinated by the male body. Not sexually but how it was built. i had a doll (lil ashamed to admit) and my brothers were all into the G.I. Joes. I just thought they were awesome cause they were built. anyway off the subject. Just because I knew i was at such an early age, some people just can't figure it out so fast. You want to be normal, but what is normal really? Following a lot of people around, trying to fit in, pretending to be something your not? To me i am normal. I do what i do and thats all there is to it. I am not your stereotypical gay male. I hate shopping, i have no fashion sense, and i am a slob."

Like the baby boomers, or the x-generation?","","The term ""baby boom"" was coined in 1941, but I can't find out by whom.\n\n""Baby boom coined 1941; derivative baby-boomer (member of the one that began 1945) first recorded 1974.""\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=baby+boomer&searchmode=none\n\nThe term ""generation X"" was coined in the 1960s by Charles Hamblett, and was popularized in 1991 by Douglas Coupland.\n\n""The term was coined as a result of a 1964 study of British youth by Jane Deverson. ... Deverson, in an attempt to save her research, worked with Hollywood correspondent Charles Hamblett to create a book about the study. Hamblett decided to name it Generation X.""\n\n""Although the origins of the term ""Generation X"" go back at least as far as the early 1960s, it was popularized by Douglas Coupland's 1991 novel 'Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture', in which Coupland describes the angst of those born between roughly 1960 and 1965, who, while technically part of the Baby Boom Generation, feel no connection to its cultural icons."" \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X\n\nA newly created word is called a ""neologism.""\n\n""A neologism is a word, term, or phrase which has been recently created (""coined"") — often to apply to new concepts, or to reshape older terms in newer language form.

The theory of memes is really interesting.\n\n""The term ""meme""... refers to any unit of cultural information, such as a cultural practice or idea or concept, which one mind transmits (verbally or by repeated action) to another mind. Examples might include thoughts, ideas, theories, practices, habits, songs, dances and moods in addition to concepts such as race.

"1","Why do churches have their windows up high and covered in stain glass?  Is it so no one can see in or out?","There have been some recent questions about why many JW Kingdom Halls don't have windows.  That got me to thinking, so tonight, as I drove 250 miles around Kansas City, I checked out every church I passed.  I noticed that all of them had windows, but they were up high and covered in stain glass.  Many respondents to the previous questions about Kingdom Halls said that it was because JWs didn't want anyone seeing what went on inside, well the same can be claimed for any church.  In fact, a lot of churches do have things to hide, as has become evident by the number of claims made of child sexual abuse.  I wonder how many churches are as open to inspection as a Kingdom Hall, such as places where children can be taken advantage of?  In Kingdom Halls, the children are not segregated from the parents to where they can be harmed.  Is this what other churches are hiding?","Stained glass is also called ""artwork""; it falls in the same category as sculptures and paintings and frescoes, etc. It is not intended to hide anything, just there to be pretty and inspire those who look at it.\n\nSin, like molesting children, is not hidden by glass, stained or otherwise. Neither is it hidden by walls of concrete, wood, plaster, or steel. It is hidden by people of corrupt mind and heart, buried behind a life of false pretences and lies and slick showmanship. \n\nWe have had child molesting ""preachers"" in my town also. The building isn't the problem. The lies are the problem! Lack of accountability is the problem."

The idea is to get your heart rate up quickly and maintain it for the duration of your w/o... \n\nWith that said, I suggest you purchase a heart rate monitor which can help regulate your pace for each exercise - depending on what your working out for (I.E. aerobics, toning, weightloss)... There are plenty of good types out there - POLAR, Reebok, MIO, are just some examples, and they come in all price ranges... \n\nBasically, Like anything else you'll get out of curves what you put in to it... \n\nHope this helps - Good Luck..."

"2","what conditions are needed for microorganisms to grow?","eg. water","You have to be more specific.  Microorganisms grow in pretty much every condition on Earth, including hot and sulfurous ocean water by volcanic vents, in ice at the poles, in badly-preserved jars (botulism--anaerobic), inside the body, in ponds, in caves, in the dark, in the sunlight...it all depends on the specific type of microorganism.\n\nFor instance, sugar tends to kill bacteria, but mold loves sugar.  So a jar of jelly left in a fridge for a long time (cold, wet, sugary environment for the microorganisms) might not have bacteria, but it could have fuzzy mold on it.  It all depends.  \n\nBut from a food safety standpoint, you want food kept either below 40 degrees fahrenheit, or above 140 degrees, and keep it wrapped up and covered to avoid stuff dropping in it.  In general, microorganisms like: warm (not hot or cold), dark, moist, and somewhat neutral pH.  That'll grow mold, mildew, fungus, and many types of bacteria.

I've let him kiss me and dance very close with me, both things I don't think hubby would like. I get a lot of enjoyment from the affection from my friend yet sometimes rationalize it saying its all in good fun, he doesn't get anything out of it and it ""doesn't count"".

To tone up and lose the most weight how often and how long should i use excercise bike for and aerobics too? will i lose more weight do you think?","It sounds like you're on the right track.  Use your exercise bike at least 3 times a week for 30 minutes.  Add weight training to your regimen.  Weight training adds lean muscle mass.  The more lean muscle mass you have, the more calories your body burns at rest.  Remember, muscle weighs more than fat, so if you lower your body fat you might not notice the difference on your scale.  Go by how you look and how your clothing fits.  Good luck!!"

"2","Why does sucking helium change your voice?","weird phenomenon, can anyone give an actual scientific answer to it?","Helium is much lighter than air. Because of this, the speed of sound is much higher in helium. When you inhale helium you increase the speed of the sound of your voice. The shape of your vocal tract doesn't change. If you increase the speed of a sound you also increase the wavelength. However, on the way to the ear the sound travels thru air again and the wavelength goes back to normal. It's not the change in frequency that gives you the squeaky voice but a change in pitch. The sound has the same frequencies but helium causes a shift in your timbre. This means the higher frequencies are getting a higher enhancement than normal so the pitch changes. The end result? You sound like a chipmunk. \n\nAlthough inhaling helium is fun it's not exactly healthy. Every time you inhale pure helium, you are not inhaling oxygen. Whatever you do, never inhale helium from a high pressure tank! Besides the serious risk of lung damage, you could end up with bubbles of helium in the arteries that lead to your brain. This can lead to stroke-like symptoms and, of course, death. Still laughing? Didn't think so."

The oil with the highest monounsaturated fat is safflower oil, but it has a very strong taste and does not work well for cooking.  Olive oil is ok, but it has a lot of monounsaturated fat and less poluunsaturated fat than does canola and it also has twice the saturated fat that canola has (raises LDL and lowers HDL).

"1","In the Kaballah, the statement ""God counts the tears of women"",how would you interpret this?","","This may be a long answer. \n\nThe Kabballah says that women are on a higher spiritual plane than men.  The reason is because they have a womb.  When God decided to create the universe, at first he couldn't.  HE filled everything.  So he had to essentially rip a hole in his own being and create a void in the middle of himself.  He then gave birth to the whole universe in the void he had torn in himself.\n\nThe womb of a woman is like this.  It is a void in the middle of her being that gives birth to new little realities.  A mother gets to watch her child grow up and grow old.  She sees the joys and pains of the child all the way until her own death.  When they cry, she cries.  When they hurt, she cries.

Its most stable form is as sodium chloride... table salt.  We put it on our food, but separately, sodium and chlorine are deadly poisons.  Chlorine is a green gas that's heavier than air and reacts with almost everything.  It turns water into hydrochloric acid, but turns sodium into sodium chloride."
"1","Why do Christians always compare the best Christians with the worst Muslims.?","I am tired of Christians always compareing the ideal Christain to terroists who do things in the name of Islam that are clearly forbidden by the teachings of Islam.  Why not compair them to the KKK Christians or the Hitler Christians, or the wife and child beating Christians or the Mass murderer Christians who claimed that God and the Bible told them to murder.  These people clearly Perverted the Christian religion to justify their own sickness.  So why can't you understand that people do this with all religions.\n\nAnd why do Christians call everything a Muslim does Terrorism.  I am sickened by true terrorism where innocent people are killed as we are taught if you kill one innocent person it is as if you have killed all of man kind.  But I also believe people who are being attacked have the right to defend themselves.  The way people act they would now define the US founding fathers were terrorists because they stood up against the English occupation.","Too bad people don't read their history books, Christianity spred practically only because it was violently forced upon the pagans. \n\nI agree with you, it's silly to think you can relate a 'terrorist' to a model Christian."

I killed a spider about 3-4 days ago by crushing it on my bed. Now I am afraid to sleep there, I don't know if the poison might hurt or kill me, and I really have no ideas about how to clean my bed in order to make it safe for me again. If I turn my bed over would the poisons aerate through the mattress or work there way through the mattress to harm me?\nPlease don't be afraid to tell me if i am being way too silly. But I am just very concernced and frightened about it. I need to clean it somehow so I can sleep again.","The vast majority of spiders have a venom so weak it is completely and totally harmless to human beings. It is venom designed for killing only other bugs about their own size and nothing larger in most cases. In the United States the spiders you generally worry about are the brown recluse spider and the black widow spider. In Australia you would be worried about Sydney Funnelweb Spider. If it was not black and did not have an hourglass red symbol on its back I would not be too worried.\n\nAs was previously suggested don't touch it, just remove the sheets at the corners for washing and change to a fresh set of linens. The blood of spiders is not poisonous. Just the venom is very small venom glands which is not a contact poison but a venom that must be injected into the bloodstream to have any effect, generally through the fangs."

Anybody can share their experience/info/advice with me? Thanks!","I work for a LASIK and cataract surgeon so I feel I can give you some advise.  \n\nThe majority of complications associated with LASIK surgery involve the process of making the flap on the cornea.  In LASIK there are two main methods for making the flap.  One is with a devise called a microkeratome, which is basically a blade that is used to cut a flap in the cornea. The other devise is a femtosecond laser called Intralase that is used to make a flap.\n\nIt is proven that the Intralase system greatly reduses the accuracy of making the flap and the chances of any significant complications with the surgery.\n\nSo the main thing that I would recommend is going with a doctor that uses Intralase rather then a microkeratome.  You should be able to find a doctor doing this in most major metropolitan areas.\n\nAnd also don't settle for the bargain basement LASIK centers.  In life, you get what you pay for.  And do you really want to buy a surgery that's on sale?\n\nWell good luck on your decision.  LASIK is definately not for everyone, but it is amazing for those that qualify for it!"

"1","Dreamcatchers..?","I know they catch dreams or they wouldn't have that name,I know the ones I have seen are extremely beautiful,but what is the history behind them and what is it that they do besides the obvious if anything?","The history of the dream catcher has nearly been lost in the turmoil of cultural mixing and destruction that followed on the heels of the European invasion.  Dreamcatcher history is known with some credibility due to the dedicated field work of Frances Densmore at the beginning of the last century.  She conducted a careful and extensive study of many Native American cultures including that of the Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa) living in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, Canada. A simple description can be found in her book, Chippewa Customs, published by the Minnesota Historical Society Press (St. Paul) in 1929 and reprinted in 1979.  She described articles looking like spider webs that were usually hung from the hoop of a child's cradle board.  She said that 'they catch and hold everything evil as a spider's web catches and holds everything that comes into contact with it'. These 'dream catchers' were wooden hoops with a 3 1/2 in. diameter, woven with a web made of nettle-stalk fiber that was dyed red with the red sap of the root of bloodroot or the inner bark of the wild plum tree.   A facsimile of this traditional dream catcher can be seen at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in central Minnesota.  The spider web dream catcher shown at the left is very similar to the original dream catcher that has been a tradition for a  very long time.  In our dream catcher weaving kits you can find the materials and instructions for weaving this classic gift for the newborn.\n\nThe common dream catcher weave seen today is the traditional weave used for other articles, most commonly the hoop for the hoop and stick game of many tribes. Woven with strong rawhide with a hole in the center, a child would roll the hoop along the ground and another would try to throw a wooden spear through the hole in the center.  Stories of the dream catcher legend that describe the dreams going through a center hole are of recent origin.  The original dream catcher had a very tiny hole in the center and the legend describes ALL dreams being caught in the weaving.\n\nFor many years, only Ojibwe people made dream catchers as each tribe made only its original crafts.  In the mid 70’s, dream catcher earrings became popular and many people of other tribes began to make dream catchers.  Not knowing how to weave the spider web or not wanting to take the extra time needed they chose the mid-point weaving style of the hoop and stick instead of the end-point weave of the ancient spider web.  Many people, not knowing the significance of the twig or not being able to find the beautiful red willow of the northern woodlands, began to use metal rings wound with leather or string.  The thread of tradition was lost.  Now in the time of the Seventh Fire, the traditions are being returned to the people.  \nEach tribe and clan, however, has its own oral tradition and memory.  Passing along that memory by storytelling has not been easy with the traditional culture challenged, the tribal languages fallen into disuse, and poverty, drugs, and conflicting values have created a climate of fear, anger, despair, and confusion.  Now there are many legends of the dreamcatcher from many different Native American cultures.  Sometimes Anishinabe tell the story of the Lakota dreamcatcher with the ""Shinob"" traditional spider web, and Lakota tell the ""Shinob"" story with their ""Lakota"" dreamcatcher.  Authenticity is difficult, if not impossible, given the intermarriage among many tribes, with non-Indians, and the loss of the continuity historically provided by traditional elders.  I have encountered a few traditional elders who wanted to learn how to weave the dreamcatcher but they could find no one in their community who would or could teach them how to weave the ancient designs of their culture.  They had come to me.  \n\nIn 1996 I taught Ojibwe people at the Rediscovery Center on t"

A better way to dissolve plastic, though, is organic solvents such as THF."

What is the horizontal speed of the pillow relative to the ground? Relative to you inside the jetliner?","Hi,\n\nGalileo was faced by similar queries and this is his response:\n\nShut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some large ship, and have with you there some flies, butterflies, and other small flying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some fish in it; hang up a bottle that empties drop by drop into a wide vessel beneath it. With the ship standing still, observe carefully how the little animals fly with equal speed to all sides of the cabin. The fish swim indifferently in all directions; the drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing something to your friend, you need throw it no more strongly in one direction than another, the distances being equal; jumping with your feet together, you pass equal spaces in every direction. When you have observed all these things carefully (though there is no doubt that when the ship is standing still everything must happen in this way), have the ship proceed with any speed you like, so long as the motion is uniform and not fluctuating this way and that. You will discover not the least change in all the effects named, nor could you tell from any of them whether the ship was moving or standing still. In jumping, you will pass on the floor the same spaces as before, nor will you make larger jumps toward the stern than toward the prow even though the ship is moving quite rapidly, despite the fact that during the time that you are in the air the floor under you will be going in a direction opposite to your jump. In throwing something to your companion, you will need no more force to get it to him whether he is in the direction of the bow or the stern, with yourself situated opposite. The droplets will fall as before into the vessel beneath without dropping toward the stern, although while the drops are in the air the ship runs many spans. The fish in their water will swim toward the front of their bowl with no more effort than toward the back, and will go with equal ease to bait placed anywhere around the edges of the bowl. Finally the butterflies and flies will continue their flights indifferently toward every side, nor will it ever happen that they are concentrated toward the stern, as if tired out from keeping up with the course of the ship, from which they will have been separated during long intervals by keeping themselves in the air. And if smoke is made by burning some incense, it will be seen going up in the form of a little cloud, remaining still and moving no more toward one side than the other. The cause of all these correspondences of effects is the fact that the ship's motion is common to all the things contained in it, and to the air also. That is why I said you should be below decks; for if this took place above in the open air, which would not follow the course of the ship, more or less noticeable differences would be seen in some of the effects noted.\n\nAlthough, this seems obvious to us now in its day it was quite startling. But it is the same for an Astronaut on a space walk. His craft appears stationary to him, although both he and it a traveling at great speed. So, we judge that something is moving only by its movement relative to us or some other object.\n\nThis, if you like, is Galilean relativity, we judge objects to be moving only if they are moving relative to our frame of reference."

"1","Do you think that Jesus is the REAL son of GOD? and what evidence do you have?","","Jesus in Islam\nIslam is a religion which requires belief in not only the Prophethood of Muhammad but all the prophets of God, including Jesus (Qur'an 2:137).\nThe Holy book of Islam, the Quran, relates in detail the story of Jesus, including his birth, mission as a Prophet to the Israelites, and his crucifixion. Muslims believe that this story is in harmony with the Bible too. Indeed, a whole chapter in the Qur'an is named after the mother of Jesus (Chapter 19 - Maryam).\n\nDivinity of Jesus\nIslam presents Jesus as a human who believed in the absolute Unity and Indivisibility of God (Qur'an 3:52). \n\nMuslims consider the doctrine of Divinity of Jesus and Trinity as later changes to the teachings of Jesus. The New Testament itself furnishes abundant evidence to show that Jesus was only a human being whom God chose for the reformation of His people, and repeatedly contradicts the Divinity of Jesus. Jesus always referred to himself as having been sent by God (John 17:3) and his followers, too, considered him a man approved by God (Qur'an 19:37; Acts 2:22, John 3:2). \n\nHe was undoubtedly called the son of God, but this title has only been employed metaphorically and in fact is used for all the chosen ones of God (Matt 5:9, Exodus 4:22). The literal connotation of 'son of God' as a Divine Being and hence the subsequent development of Trinity Dogma was the result of Hellenistic influences on Christianity as it spread in the Gentile world. The Semitic usage of 'son of God' was misunderstood and forgotten and disputes about the exact status of Jesus erupted, as recorded in the early Church history. \n\nJesus prayed to God like all other God-fearing individuals (Luke 5:16), and engaged in spiritual exercises such as fasting (Matt 4:2). Furthermore, Jesus lacked knowledge of the future (Mark 13:32), as only the Divine Being possesses perfect and complete knowledge."

I woke up and went through my normal routine and all the sudden the allergies appear. All the allergy medicines I've taken don't help me at all. Should I see a doctor?","It could be the  pollen in the air or dust in your air filtering unit.  I would recommend a thorough cleaning of your home..dust first, vacuum with a hepa filter bag, wash the animals inside and brush them; wash your linens in hot water and bleach.  Get rid of anything that collects alot of dust, like certain fabrics in drapes or alot of clutter; rugs and carpet are great dust/mite collectors.  Change your pillow for a new fiber one (no feathers/down) and stick with natural materials.  Keep yourself well hydrated to keep any mucous thin so it will not trap bacteria.  This is especially if you take any antihistimes, like Benedryl, as they dry out the sinuses.  Hope this will help; although I would recommend you see a doctor to get a good allergy medication."

If you have been treating your face for acne, you have probably dried out the dry sections, like your forehead.  Use a little moisturizer on your forehead after you wash, while it is still a little damp.\nAvoid moisturizers with any Isopropyl Myristate.\n You are very unlikely to have wrinkles unless your forehead is in a permanent frown.  Unlikely, but if so, lighten up.\nHere is a description of maisturizers to avoid, but still, find a good one and the ""wrinkles"" will be gone.\n\nOne of the worse offenders is a penetrating oil called isopropyl myristate, the major ingredient in a can of penetrating rust remover, Liquid Wrench.  Isopropyl Myristate helps cosmetics apply more smoothly and gives them a slicker, sheer feel. This particular penetrating oil is so aggressive that if left over night in a beaker will actually migrate over the top, down the sides and onto the table top.  There are may chemicals similar to isopropyl myristate in cosmetics.  The most common are:  isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl isothermal, putty sterate, isostearyl neopentonate, myristyl myristate, decyl oleate, octyl sterate, octyl palmitate and isocetyl stearate and PPG myristyl propionate.

Right after surgery they will start to exercise it - and I'm not kidding RIGHT after it. Whatever you do, do NOT let your friend just not use their shoulder. Of course you should use caution but not using it all can cause frozen shoulder - which is very very painful. In shoulder, knee, and hip surgery - movement creates osteoblasts which regenerate what bone was taken away ,etc. The more the joint is used (within reason) the better off the patient will be. \n\nYour friends doctor will give you care instructions. Thanksgiving dinner may be difficult, but it is possible. She will not be laid up in bed but for maybe a day. \n\nGood luck with the lab - I suggest a large crate or keeping him outside as much as possible.

If I died a stillborn does it still count. Is being born a sin in it's self? I don't get it.","simple answer:\n\nbecause he loves you\n\nExtended answer:\n\nThe first issue revolves around the perfection in God's creation. Some Bible students believe the Genesis account teaches perfection only in Eden. Outside the bounds of paradise there was a fallen world with death and destruction. Sin had entered the universe through the fall of Satan and the earth was subject to his dominion. If the Devil had already sinned before Adam and Eve, then evil had already been brought into the universe. Adam's sin, therefore would affect only the earth, not the heavens. Some Bible commentators want to restrict Adam's sin to Eden - the small plot of ground on the earth that had not been tainted by sin. \n\nScripture says Christ’s death was part of God’s eternal purpose.\n\nThen I said, ‘Here I am - it is written about me in the scroll - I have come to do your will, O God.” First he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them” (although the law required them to be made). Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all (Hebrews 10:7-\n\nJesus Paid The Penalty For Sin\n\nThe death of Christ was the payment for sin—the ransom paid to God to satisfy His holy demands. The Bible pictures humans as sinners who had rebelled against God. Christ’s death on the cross paid the penalty for the sin of humankind. Jesus died in our place as our substitute, receiving the punishment that was due us.\n\nThe Bible says.\n\n[Jesus Christ] was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification (Romans 4:25).\n\nThe writer to the Hebrews declared.\n\nSo Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many (Hebrews 9:28).\n\nThe penalty that Jesus paid for sin was not only for the human race; it was also for everything in the universe that had been marred by sin.\n\nBecause the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God (Romans 8:21).\n\nThe demands of a holy God were satisfied by Jesus’ death on the cross."

They are most likely indicating near correct pH in a vary stable solution and not very responsive over a large range ( in other words they're currently zeroed into reading correctly and wont if the solution varies a lot). The failure rate after 2 months maybe the case with electrodes that have been on a shelf for long periods beore being commissioned for use or less likely but I have seen it - a bad ""batch"" of electrodes you received from stock.

I lost about 10 pounds just by switching to healthier foods, and jogging. I have a normal/healthy bmi, but I havn't gotten my period for 3 months..should I be worried?","Sometimes when women don't weight enough, they won't get their period.  It's common for athletes--especially female gymnasts--to have this happen.  You might want to check with your doctor to make sure that your diet and exercise are appropriate for you.  Eliminating all fat from your diet isn't good, the body needs some fat to function, and fat is necessary to cushion your internal organs to make sure they aren't harmed while you go about your normal daily activities.  \n\nYou may be just fine and healthy, but then again you may need to adjust your diet to include a few more calories.\n\nBeing underweight and exercising too much can be just as dangerous as being overweight and never exercising."
"3","What is the ideal combination of sets and reps in weight training to gain muscle size?","","You actually have to train all three muscle fiber types which means changing up your workout routine every six to eight weeks. Each fiber type requires a different approach. You are mainly concerned with type-2a and 2b. Type-2b has no endurance but is very strong so go heavey with 6 to 8 reps for a few weeks then switch over to type-2a meaning less weight from 15 to 20 reps, you can use your imagination and do inclined and or declined pyramid sets meaning you do four sets and add or subtract some weight each set. When adding weight your reps go down. You should never totally neglect your type-1 fibers, they are weak but have tons of endurance so maybe choose a weight were you can do anywhere from 50 to 100 reps with no burn but you only have to do this once or twice a month."

"2","what is the role of Cl- channels in membrane and action potentials?","","There are potassium ion channel pumps on the cell membrane. This pump pumps out CL ions and bring in K+ ions. It  goes against the flow of diffusion, so energy is needed. When an action potential is created, it oppens Cl- gated channels which, due to the differnt concentrations (more on the outside) the CL rushes back in, creating a change in cell voltage."

"1","why is Odysseus heroic?","","Deathless gods, in the Homeric presentation, had great supernatural powers which they employed to shape world [human] events.  These self same supernatural affinities could and often would resort to astound the less endowed ""mortals"" thus holding the mankind in a state of bewildered subjugation.  The condition was nothing short of a psychological tyranny.  Odysseus, as a man, could effect events and meet challenges with nothing more than the innate mortal qualities of intellect, sagacity and virtue.  He demonstrated that 'man' by sheer force of will with the employment of virtue could also shape events thus having a dramatic impact upon the life's course.  In so doing Odysseus demonstrated that the gap between gods and man was not as wide an expanse as suspected.  Therefore man could be free.  To this end he becomes the icon of the heroic figure."

Planet Earth will move in the opposite direction some day and the sun will rise from the west!\n\nNow please tell me weather or not you have heard of such thing ?","Every morning on Mars, the Sun rises in the East, and every evening, it sinks to the West.\nSomeone got cunfused with they're information. MARS ITSELF \nRISES AND SETS IN THE EARTH'S SKIES FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST.\nThe retrograde motion is what causes MARS to shift rise and set directions in OUR SKY.\n\nFor the Sun in the skies of Mars to rise and set  in opposite horizons would mean that Mars suddenly came to a stop and started spinning backwards on it's axis.\nMars could only change its direction of planetary rotation if a planet larger than itself crashed into it with an unimaginable amount of force.\nSo no, that information is incorrect and Mars still rotates the same way around our sun."

That works awesome on my teeth. Also I just tried another tooth paste made by colgate. It comes in a purple tube. It's called colgate Luminous paradise fresh. That works pretty good too.

"2","Why id the CSA of a cone ( pi*r * l) ?","Shouldn't it be (2* p1*r* l) ?","Good that you care to ask. The answer to this should be evident to you by integration (hope you have been introduced to calculus? If not, you will be this year.). \n\nI assume that you don't have much of a background.\n \nOK, let the cone be such that its height is H, base radius R. \n\nWhat you need to do is consider an infinitesimally thin section of the cone (a diagram should be so helpful here, unfortunately not possible) at height h from the bottom and of height (along the axis) 'dh', such that the radius of the section is a uniform 'r'. \n\n(Note that you have a uniform radius r to the section because you have chosen a very thin section of the cone.)\n\nNow, the surface area of the section considered is \n2*pi*r*dh*cosec x. (x is the cone half-angle)\n\nThe cosec term comes from basic trigonommetry, when you realise that the section is tilted and not exactly parallel to the axis. \n\nThe surface area  of the entire cone, indeed the curved surface area, is a summation of all such infinitesimal sections, each of surface area 2*pi*r*dh* cosec x \n(where r is the radius of each section). \n\nThis above sum can be found by \nintegrating 2*pi*r*dh*cosec x (that is a word in the language of calculus for finding out the sum of many small parts) over the entire height of the cone. \n\nalso realise that r = h tan x. \n\nso an integration of 2*pi*htan x*cosecx*dh gives us,\n\nCSA = 2*pi*sec x* (H^2/2)  \n    = pi*R* H (sec x/tan x)\n    = pi*R* H cosec x\n    = pi*R*L\n\nHope this satisfies."

"3","I need to know stuff about lipids, starches sugars and carbs?","everything you know. right here.","Lipids are always fats. There are animal fats and vegetable fats. Within those two groups, there are also ""saturated"" fats and ""unsaturated"" fats ... that only means differences in the number of hydrogen atoms that are part of the fat molecule. Lipids have the highest calorie rating of any of the foods for the same size portion. They are an ""energy-dense"" food. The right kinds of fats are ""essential"" and MUST be eaten every day! A blanket condemnation of ""fat"" is seriously wrong. \n\nThere are good, essential, fats. These are not man-made (like trans-fats or hydrogenated fats). The best fats are monosaturated fats like cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil, medium chain fatty acids like organic extra-virgin coconut oil (yes, it's a saturated fat ... and in this case, that's OK), the fat from only grass-fed, free-range animals, organic hemp oil, hemp seeds, flax oil, flax seeds, nuts and nut oils.\n\nFat helps us feel ""satisfied"", and in the end, we may eat fewer calories; it also ""slows down"" the insulin ""hit"" that too many carbs can initiate or too high-glycemic carbs can produce (i.e. stay away from sugary foods).\n\nCarbohydrates are necessary for life. If you do not eat them, then expensive protein is broken down to ""make"" carbs! Your brain needs good carbs for fuel. The best carbs for diabetics are veggies. The less sweet (lower ""glycemic"" ones) are best, but you can have a few sweet peas or corn or sweet potatoes etc, (which are more concentrated, higher glycemic types) as long as there are not lots (maybe 1/2 cup max) and they are eaten with a little fat or protein. Fruit is healthy, but should always be a second choice to vegetables. Fruits should also be ranked according to sweetness. Tomatoes and avocados are fruits, and these are good choices, as are lemons, limes etc. Apples have chromium in their skin, and that helps diabetics. All sugars are carbs, and processed sugars and honey etc are to be largely avoided. Artificial sweeteners stimulate insulin and there is NO benefit to using them ... in fact, there are many reasons NOT to use them.\n\nThere are combo foods. Milk is one of them. It is both a carb (milk sugars) and protein food. It's fairly balanced.\n\nProtein is best limited to protect kidney health, and about 6 oz. of protein a day will be adequate for most people. Organic, free-range, Omega-3 eggs are a very good protein source, and there is no longer a tight restriction about numbers of eggs to eat per week. Fish from clean waters is another good choice. Cheese, nuts and for some people, soy are other options, as are free-range, grass fed animals.\n\nAmpalaya (bitter melon) found in Asian markets, bilberries and cinnamon, and many other foods have been found to be specifically beneficial for diabetics. If you use these, make sure you are taking more frequent blood sugar readings so you know how responsive your body is to their blood-sugar lowering capabilities. \n\nIt is better to eat 6 smaller meals, fairly evenly spaced through the day onward to a bedtime snack, than to eat just 3 meals a day. I hope this helped. Make sure you are well-hydrated, only use water!\n\nTo learn more about possibly ameliorating or even reversing diabetes, read www.watercure.com   www.phmiracleliving.com  \n\nBest to all ..."

Here's how i did it:\n\nYou can find the # mol of NaOH used:\n\nMolarity = (# mol)/(volume solution)\n0.4 = (# mol)/(.075 L)\n\nSolving, you get 0.03 mol of NaOH.\n\nUsing the balanced equation:\n\n3 NaOH + H3PO4 ==> Na3PO4 + 3 H2O \n\nYou see that 3 mol NaOH = 1 mol H3PO4.  Thus, if we have 0.03 mol NaOH, that means we have 0.01 mol H3PO4.\n\nNow we can solve for the molarity:\n\nMolarity = (0.01 mol H3PO4)/(0.05 L) = 0.2 M"
"2","What exactly is bilateral symmetry?","If possible list a site with pictures or information about it.","An object is symmetrical if it could be cut down the middle and produce two mirror images.  ""Bilateral"" just means ""two sides"", indicating that the object is symetrical in one direction.  The term is used in biology, and is a common trait of the animal kingdom.  \n\nFor instance, look at yourself.  You have one eye on either side of your nose, one ear on either side of your head, one arm on either side of your shoulders and one leg on either side of your hips.  If you took a picture of yourself and cut it down the middle, from top to bottom, the two pictures would be mirror images of one another.  This is bilateral symmetry, the same on both sides."

""Sex, for a Christian, is the order given by God in the first chapter of the Bible, just after the creation of male and female, his very first commandment was: ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth"" (Gen.1:28). The Bible talks with respect and dignity about sex, for the purpose of having children, and always to take place in the context of marriage.\n\nThe Bible is silent on physical techniques of sexual intercourse, but it is very clear that all sex activity have to end with intercourse to have the chance of fertilization. Any sexual activity which does not end in intercourse is immoral and forbidden, be it oral or anal sex, or masturbation. Any kind of homosexuality is actually a form of masturbation, which is the act of having ejaculation or sexual pleasure without intercourse.

(Answer: The thoracic vertebrae are fused to provide a rigid upper shell to withstand the muscular forces of flight muscles. As partial compensation for this rigidity, birds have more neck vertebrae than many animals to provide enough flexibility to feed, groom, etc. See ref. 1.)\nSnake: How does the snake's vertebra indicate that it evolved to support slithering? (Answer: Snakes have a large number of vertebrae, which are connected together by ball-and socket joints. These characteristics allow extreme flexibility. Together with specialized muscles, the vertebra enable the snake to move with speed and agility. See ref. 2.)"

And I believe Cannon is a section of the church as well.  Where did this word come from and what does it mean in a religious context?","'Canon,' in this context, comes from a word meaning 'measuring rod.' It refers to the books which are recognized as being the Word of God.\n\nFor Old Testament books, they were not accepted unless people knew that they were written by a prophet.  Most books of the Old Testament have a connection to the book before them; this is known as the colophon principle.  Many of the apocryphal books in Catholic bibles were never accepted by the Jews of the time, but were added centuries later.\n\nFor New Testament books, they were not accepted unless they were written by an apostle or by a close traveling companion of an apostle (ie, Mark and Luke).\n\nAs far as the Catholic church goes, they have their 'canon law,' which they define as ""the name attached to that body of rules or laws for the direction of all faithful in matters of faith and conduct.""  It is their laws which they have added to the Bible.\n\nAs far as a 'section of the church,' I assume you mean a church building; in classical architecture, the chancel is the area where the people sit."
"2","when usung 'feet' for measurement, was that word originally introduced to relate walking steps?","","I think it is originally a British unit of length, equal to the length of a foot, created by tradesmen so they could record and plan lengths.\n\nThe ""Official"" foot was the lenght of the foot of the king - which is awkward, since it will change as kings change.\n\nEdit: hmm.. I got most of it right... here is the text from Wikipedia:\nThe foot as a measure was used in almost all cultures. The first known standard foot measure was from Sumeria, where a definition is given in a statue of Gudea of Lagash from around 2575 BC. The imperial foot was adapted from an Egyptian measure by the Greeks, with a subsequent larger foot being adopted by the Romans.\n\nThe popular belief is that original standard was the length of a man's foot. The original measurement was from King Henry I, who had a foot 12 inches long; he wished to standardise the unit of measurement in England. The average foot length is about 9.4 inches (240 mm) for current Europeans. Approximately 996 out of 1000 British men have a foot that is less than 12 inches long. A plausible explanation for the missing inches is that the measure did not refer to a naked foot, but to the length of footwear. This is consistent with the measure being convenient for practical purposes such as on building sites etc. People almost always pace out lengths whilst wearing shoes or boots, rather than removing them and pacing barefoot."

"1","mention some names of indian women freedom fighters?","","Woman's participation in India's freedom struggle began as early as 1817 when Bhima Bai Holkar fought bravely against the British colonel Malcolm and defeated him in guerilla warfare. In 1824 Rani Channama of Kittur resisted ate armed might of the East Indian Company. \n\n1 Rani of Jhansi \nRani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi whose heroism and superb leadership laid an outstanding example for all future generations of women freedom fighters. Married to Gangadhar Rao head of the state of Jhansi. She was not allowed to adopt a successor after his death by the British, and Jhansi was annexed. \nWith the outbreak of the Revolt she became determined to fight back. She used to go into the battlefield dressed as a man. Holding the reins of there horse in her mouth she used the sword with both hands. Under her leadership the Rani's troops showed undaunted courage and returned shot for shot. Considered by the British as the best and bravest military leader of rebels this sparkling epitome of courage died a hero's death in the battlefield. \nThe first name that comes to mind is that of the famous Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi. Dressed in men’s clothes, she led her soldiers to war against the British. Even her enemies admired her courage and daring. She fought valiantly and although beaten she refused to surrender and fell as a warrior should, fighting the enemy to the last. Her remarkable courage inspired many men and women in India to rise against the alien rule. \n\n2.  SAROJINI NAIDU \nThe other remarkable woman elected to the presidentship Indian National Congress was Sarojini Naidu. She became its president.dramatic meeting with another respected leader of time, Gokhle, in 1906 was to change her life forever. His response to her fiery speech brought into her life the impact of a visionary who saw in her oratory and brilliance a leader of the future. \n\nThe period from 1917 to 1919 was the most dynamic phase of Sarojini's career. During this time, she campaigned for the Montagu Chelmsford Reforms, the Khilafat issue, the draconian Rowlett Act and the Satyagraha. When Gandhi launched the Civil Disobedience Movement ,she proved a faithful lieutenant. With great courage she quelled the rioters, sold proscribed literature, addressed frenzied meetings on the carnage at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar.In 1930 when Mahatma Gandhi chose her to lead the Salt Satyagraha the stories of her courage became legion. After Gandhi's arrest she had prepared 2,000 volunteers under the scorching sun to raid the Dahrsana Salt Works, while the police faced them half a mile up the road with rifle, lathis (canes) are steel tipped clubs. The volunteers wildly cheered when she shook off the arm of the British police officer who came to arrest her and marched proudly to the barbed wire stockade where she was interned before being imprisoned. Freedom struggle was in full force and she came under the influence of Gopalakrishna Gokhale  and Gandhi. Gokhale advised her to spare all her energy and talents for nation's cause. She gave up writing poetry and fully devoted herself to emancipation of women, education, Hindu-Muslim unity etc. She became a follower of Gandhiji and accompanied him to England. Whenever in England, she openly criticized British rule in India which caught the attention of scholars and intellectuals. \n  \n3.KASTURBA GANDHI \nKasturba Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi's wife joined her husband while he was in South Africa and worked with him for many years there. She was a leader of Women's Satyagraha for which she was imprisoned. She helped her husband in the cause of Indigo workers in Champaran, Bihar and the No Tax Campaign in Kaira, Gujarat. She was arrested twice for picketing liquor and foreign cloth shops, and in 1939 for participating in the Rajkot Satyagraha. \n  \n4.ARUN ASAF ALI \nArun Asaf Ali, a radical nationalist played an outstanding role in the historic Quit India Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi on August 9, 194"

"1","Do you agree with the arguements the book ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" presents?","","Not really, it seems a desperate move to start moving letters around to fit a predetermined theory. The original grail (gradale) was a dish or plate - however, with the absence of such an artifact at some time in the past it became associated with a wine goblet (probably communion related) - then with the further absence of a suitably impressive cup it becomes the geneological blood line. In my opinion it is a dish or plate. The big question is ""why must it be kept hidden?"" The answer is that if discovered the images that are engraved into its surface will destroy the basis of the Christian religion. Consider this: Jesus existed, a clever and honest man, but his occupation was not a carpenter but a ""storyteller."" In his possession was the tool of his trade - a plate engraved with the prehistoric zodiac that preceded the present zodiac, a very ancient planisphere that had been passed down through the family for thousands of years. The images on this plate were used to form ""stories"" or even ""parables"" for others to listen to. The angels, the nativity, John the Baptist and even the crucifixion were stories that could be made up and read from the images on this plate. If this were true it would explain why the grail has never been found - it would destroy Christianity."

I found that when I sleep on a good mattress none of my limbs fall asleep. I have had the best luck on memory foam mattresses because there are no coils pushing against my body to cut off circulation. As a side sleeper you need a mattress that conforms to your body not a mattress that forces you to conform to it. \n2. Your circulation may need some help. There are lots of natural supplements you can take to improve circulation like niacin, and B complexes. \n3. Try to change how you sleep.

"2","How does orgasm give pleasure for both men and women? what is the science behind it?","","General\nBoth males and females can experience orgasms, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation.\n\nShared physiology\nOrgasm is the conclusion of the plateau phase of the sexual response cycle, shared by males and females alike. During orgasm, both males and females experience quick cycles of muscle contraction in the lower pelvic muscles, which surround both the anus and the primary sexual organs.\n\nOrgasms in both men and women are often associated with other involuntary actions, including vocalizations and muscular spasms in other areas of the body. Also, a generally euphoric sensation is associated with orgasm.\n\nAfterwards, orgasm generally causes perceived tiredness, and both males and females often feel a need to rest. This is recently attributed to the release of prolactin[1]. Prolactin is a typical neuroendocrine response in depressed mood and irritation[2].\n\nA recent study at the University of Groningen has indicated significant differences in brain activity during the female and male orgasm. PET scans showed that both the female and male orgasm 'shut down' areas in the brain associated with anxiety and fear (the Amygdala). It was found that the male orgasm focused the brain on sensory input from the genitals more than a female orgasm.\n\n\nHuman male orgasm\nIn a human male orgasm, there are rapid, rhythmic contractions of the prostate, urethra and the muscles at the base of the penis, which (in the adult) typically forces stored semen to be expelled through the penis' urethral opening, in a process known as peristalsis. This is referred to as ejaculation. The process usually takes from 3 to 10 seconds. The process is usually, but not always, extremely pleasurable. Orgasm is generally induced by direct stimulation of the penis. Some men experience heightened orgasm by direct stimulation of the prostate through the perineum.\n\nAs a man ages, it is normal for the amount of ejaculate to diminish, and hence, the length of time the man sustains orgasm also diminishes somewhat. This does not affect the pleasurable feeling of orgasm at all, it merely shortens the duration of it.\n\nFollowing ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs during which a man cannot have another orgasm. This period can be anywhere from less than a minute to over half a day, depending on age and other individual factors. A few cases have been reported of men who appear to have no refractory period at all. Scientists theorize that a pituitary gland difference may cause this unique ability.\n\nMale prostate orgasm\nSome men are able to achieve ejaculation or orgasm through intra-anal stimulation of the prostate gland. Men reporting the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to women's accounts of g-spot stimulation. Other men report finding anal stimulation or penetration of any kind to be painful, or simply that they find no profound pleasure from it. With sufficient stimulation, the prostate can also be ""milked"". Providing that there is no simultaneous stimulation of the penis, prostate milking can cause ejaculation without orgasm. When combined with penile stimulation, some men report that prostate stimulation increases the volume of their ejaculation, and provides an enhanced and more pleasurable version of the standard male orgasm.\n\n\nMale multiple orgasms\nIt is possible to have an orgasm without ejaculation (dry orgasm) or to ejaculate without reaching orgasm. Some men report that the ability to consciously separate orgasm and ejaculation has allowed them to achieve multiple orgasms. Men who have practiced this technique extensively report that they can sometimes experience a continuous ""wave"" of orgasm. This can last, in theory, indefinitely, but in practice is limited by the man's "

"3","what is the max weight that i can lose in like two weeks and how?","","2 percent\ntry taboo\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... ""Bible"", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck"

"2","what is  equatorial region ?","its description with respect to temperature , climate ,rainfall , vegetation","The tropics or the equatorial regions,   are the geographic region of the Earth centered on the equator (parallel 0) and limited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer in the northern hemisphere, at approximately 23°26' (23.4°) N latitude, and the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern hemisphere at 23°26' (23.4°) S latitude. This region is also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone.\n\nThis area includes all the areas of the Earth where the sun reaches a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year. (In the temperate zones, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun never reaches an altitude of 90° or directly overhead.) The word ""tropics"" comes from Greek tropos meaning ""turn"", because the apparent position of the Sun oscillates between the two tropics with a period that defines the average length of a year.\n\nTropical plants and animals are those species native to the tropics. Tropical is also sometimes used in a general sense for a tropical climate, a climate that is warm to hot and moist year-round, often with the sense of lush vegetation. However, there are places in the tropics that are anything but ""tropical"" in this sense, with even alpine tundra and snow-capped peaks, including Mauna Kea, Mt. Kilimanjaro, and the Andes as far south as the northernmost parts of Chile and Argentina. Places in the tropics which are drier with low humidity are such as the Sahara Desert and Central Africa and Northern Australian Outback.\n\nTropical ecosystems may consist of rainforests, dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, desert and other habitat types. There are often significant areas of biodiversity and species endemism present particularly in rainforests and dry deciduous forests. Some examples of important biodiversity and/or high endemism ecosystems are: Costa Rican rainforests, Madagascar dry deciduous forests, Waterberg Biosphere of South Africa and eastern Madagascar rainforests. Often the soils of tropical forests are low in nutrient content making them quite vulnerable to slash-and-burn techniques, which are sometimes an element of shifting cultivation agricultural systems-."

"1","Man's sinful cause given freewill & ate apple; Why is Satan evil? When did he get freewill?","From my understanding, angels have no freewill.  They are just servants to god.  So where Satan get freewill from? Why is he evil?  God created him....   (sorry, I tried to ask this question earlier... but I couldn't include all the information needed in the question line and people were reading the details).","Angels were created 4 His pleasure. To worship Him and praise Him. They were here before we were.Satan it says in the Bible was the praise & worship leader of Gods heavenly choir. His angelic name was Lucifer.\n\n One day satan started to wonder why he wasn't considered an equal to our Creator. Then he started to question Gods authority over him and over the other angels and he began to rally them against God. One third of the angels he convinced to war against God. And the way satan became evil was a little sin called Pride. Through out all of this God never interfered.\n\n I think God was waiting for Lusifer to repent. God loves all his creations until He cant reach them anymore. He waited until satan & his followers came agaist Him ready to battle. Ofcourse God won and cast him down to the earth.\nAll of this occurred before man was created. \n\nI belive that the reason GoD gives us all free will,angels included, is because He is a good parent. I am a mother and I know that I have to let my children make mistakes so that they will, with my guidence, become the kind of adult that I can be proud of & welcome into my home forever. But when they choose not to be good, and I know that I cant reach them anymore, I will cast them out of my house. It will break my heart but I must do it to show the others in my house or the other ones that want to be a part of my house, that that sort of bahavior will not be tolerated. \n\nBecause a parent must love all thier creations, we let them have free will. Understand? Read the Bible and you will see many ways that He has loved us."

All they have to do is figure out why we can't see it and replicate the pigmentation.","I suppose we could find some sort of clear plexi-glass type of material that would be suitable for aircraft-grade structures, but making the entire plane clear would probably be impossible.  A materials science engineer would probably know more about this.\n\nOne question from me though: is there a need for this?  The stealth bomber, for example, flies so high that visual detection by ground based anti-aircraft emplacements is quite low.  So low, in fact, that I have heard that it has never been fired upon from the ground (don't quote me on that though).  So for modern military aircraft applications, I would say radar invisibility is far more important than visual invisibility.\n\nAs a side note, I had read about a clothing-like light scattering material in either Popular Science or the Spectum magazine (forget which).  Anyway, it somehow bends or scatters light in such a way as to partially reveal what is behind the covered object.  There was a picture of a guy wearing a piece of it, and I was pretty amazed.

In humans, emotional tears can be accompanied by reddening of the face and sobbing — cough-like, convulsive breathing, sometimes involving spasms of the whole upper body. Tears brought about by emotions have a different chemical make up than those for lubrication.""\n(Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears )\n\nBut I want to know more...","I'm not sure exactly what your question is, there's what happens chemically in the brain, there's what happens chemically in the lachrymal glands etc etc. What I can tell you is that the excretion of tears does not have a anti-toxic function as is generally believed. Emotional tears do not get rid of a relevant amount of toxins or hormones. \nAs far as I know, the biological function of crying has not yet been determined as such. Although it has been suggested that crying is more an effect of a certain emotional relaxation, sort of 'letting go' of tension after which the physical reaction of crying occurs."

In 1648, the Cossacks, led by Bohdan Chmielicki, began a series of campaigns by instigating the uprising of the Cossacks against the Jews. Chmielicki told people that the Poles had sold them as slaves “into the hands of the accursed Jews.” Angered by this notion, the Cossacks massacred tens of thousands of Jews during 1648-1649, in a war that would later be considered among the worst of that time period. \n\nMany Polish Jews fled the country, but most were brutally murdered. The massacre was devastating — both in numbers and effect. According to Jewish chronicles, the death toll reached approximately 100,000, and nearly 300 Jewish communities were destroyed. Cossack cruelty was so great that many Jews preferred to flee to captivity under Crimean Tartars, to be sold as slaves. The Deluge, as the catastrophe came to be known, brought devastation to both the Jews and the general population during the years of insurrection, invasions and wars. Famine and epidemics swept through parts of the country.\n\nThe following excerpts describe eyewitness accounts of the atrocities that took place in the regions of Mogila, Zaslav, and Nemirov, between 1648 until 1651.\n\nIn the city of Mogila they slaughtered 800 nobles together with their wives and children as well as 700 Jews, also with wives and children. Some were cut into pieces, others were ordered to dig graves into which Jewish women and children were thrown and buried alive. Jews were given rifles and ordered to kill each other...They surround young women and, as they struggled to escape, cut their clothes from their bodies. Then they performed abominations on them until they died screaming....\n\nThey arrived... (disguised) as if they had come with the Poles... in order that he open the gates of the fortress... and they succeeded... and they massacred about 6,000 souls in the town... and they drowned several hundreds in the water and by all kinds of cruel torments. In the synagogue, before the Holy Ark, they slaughtered with butchers' knives... after which they destroyed the synagogue and took out all the Torah books... they tore them up... and they laid them out... for men and animals to trample on... they also made sandals of them... and several other garments"".\n\nSome were skinned alive and their flesh was thrown to the dogs; some had their hands and limbs chapped off and their bodies thrown on the highway to be trampled by wagons and crushed by horses; some had wounds inflicted upon them and were then thrown on the street to die a slow death. They tore open women and then whipped them forcing them to crawl to their deaths.... others were buried alive. The enemy slaughtered infants in their mothers' laps. They were sliced into pieces like fish.... The infants were hung on the breasts of their mothers. Some children were pierced with spears.\n\nThe Ukraine did eventually become independent — but not for long. In 1651, Chmielnicki suffered defeat and was forced to accept a treaty that did not give him as much control over the Ukraine as he had hoped. In 1654, Chmielnicki persuaded the Cossacks to transfer their allegiance to the Russian czars. Anti-Semitism worsened after the Ukraine was annexed by Russia in 1653, as the Nationalist and Socialist Party of the Ukraine took control over the region. The pogroms of 1881 broke out and spread through the provinces of the Ukraine.\n\nBut even the Chmielnicki massacres didn’t halt Jewish migration to the Ukraine. Jews continued to play a prominent role in the economic recovery of the country during the 17th and 18th centuries. The sufferings endured by "

"2","what makes the sky blue?","","The sky appears blue to us on a clear day, because the atoms of nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere separate the suns white light into its many colours, and scatter them throughout the atmosphere.The wavelength of the blue light scatters better than the rest, predominates over the other colours in the light spectrum, and makes the sky appear blue to us.The scientific name for this phenomenon is the Tyndall effect, more commonly known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\nThis phenomenon describes the way in which light physically scatters when it passes through particles in the earths atmosphere that are 1/10th in diameter of the color of the light. The light spectrum ranges in wavelength from red to violet, and, since the wavelength of the blue light passes through the particles with greater ease than the wavelengths of the other colors of light, the sky appear blue to the naked eye.\n\nThe human eye has three types of light receptors, known as cones, located in the retina. The cones are either considered to be red, or blue, or green, based upon their strong response to light at these wavelengths. As light stimulates these receptors, our vision translates the signals into the colors we see.\n\nWhen gazing at the sky, the red cones respond to the small amounts of red light scattered, and even less strongly to the orange and yellow wavelengths. Although green cones respond to yellow, their response to scattered green and green-blue wavelengths is stronger. Finally, colors near the strongly scattered blue wavelengths stimulate the blue receptors.\n\nIn short, the skylight stimulates the red and green cones almost equally, while stimulating the blue cones more strongly. For these reasons, our vision naturally adjusts as clearly as possible to separate colors."

Once one has made this decision, there is no turning back...just like there is NO turning back for any of the fallen angels who made their decision to follow Satan and not God.\n\nSatan is in the business of using as many human agents (dupes) as possible to help accomplish his purposes of keeping as many humans from turning to God as possible. \n\nDon't be one of Satan's dupes.

"2","How long would it take for satelite to reach mysterious dark energy?","","Dark Energy is a theoretical tool based on the need to explain observations of the Universe.\n\nCurrent cosmological theories are dominated by the 'Big Bang' theory. When this theory is proven wrong, then the need for Dark Energy will go away. It is theorized because the cosmologists need it to make their mathematical formulae to agree with previously accepted theories. It is like a carpenter who uses a ruler, believing it to accurately measure 1 foot. But he is not taking into account the expansion or contraction of the ruler depending on the ruler's temperature. In a small scale - the carpenter's project - such a tiny change is unimportant. But when the ruler becomes very very long, then such changes in length become unacceptable. At first, the carpenter will believe that some other factor was the reason that his measurements - taken on days with differing temperatures - produced differing lengths. But once the carpenter understand the relationship of his tool to temperature, he can take the temperature into account. \n\nCosmology is using many old tools as it tries to explain the Universe. But it is too soon to understand all the variables that are producing conflicting answers. Cosmologists make their best guess as to which tools are giving the best, most accurate, most usable answers, and then go on from there.\n\n;-D But every tool that has an unknown error or bias makes finding the truth impossible. That is why there are theories that are almost exact opposites of each other. Such theories can not both be correct. Probably they are both wrong."

There are many possible reasons why moths are attracted to light but the most obvious is that many moths use the moon to navigate at night. By keeping the moon in a particular position the moth can fly in a straight line and in the direction it wants. Unfortunately moths confuse bright lights for the moon and when they get close to the light they can't navigate properly and end up flying round and round in circles."

We have a month to try and help with diet and exercise.  Need help with the diet side.  Thanks!","When you eat, your body converts any food you don't need right away into triglycerides. Therefore, simply reducing the total amount of food you eat would reduce triglyceride levels. In addition to the amount of food, the kind of food matters, too. Avoid sugary foods, since they can raise triglycerides more than other healthy foods. Alcohol also has an even more potent ability to raise triglycerides, so avoid it. The same foods you would eat to be heart healthy (whole grains, low fat dairy, green vegetables) are the ones you would eat to reduce triglycerides. The Mayo Clinic has a wonderful article on this subject; please give it a click.  Good luck. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/triglycerides/CL00015"

"2","Is the longest day adjacent to the shortest night?","My dad has insisted for years that it isn't.   When I ask him to explain he says ""it's the obliquity of the elliptic"" and that's as far as I get.\n\nNote to the drongo 2-point collectors: yes I KNOW that day and night are not the same as each other!","I'm not sure what he means by his explanation, but he's not totally off to think there would at least be a possibility of the longest 'day' not being adjacent to the shortest 'night'.\n\nAs measured from the Sun's local zenith to the next local zenith, solar days are not the same length of time (24 hours is just the average amount of time to get from noon to noon).  It takes longer to get from local noon to the next local noon at the solstices when the Earth is tilted directly toward or directly away from the Sun.  The shortest solar days (noon to noon) should be at the equinoxes.  (In other words, if there are more total seconds in the solar day at the solstice, then having the most daylight seconds doesn't necessarily mean having the shortest night time seconds).\n\nAdditionally, the Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical.  At perihelion (closest point to the Sun), the Earth is traveling faster and sweeping out a bigger angle per second.  That means the Earth has to rotate further to get back to noon the next day.  Solar days near perihelion are longer while solar days near apohelion (furthest from Sun) are shorter.  This is where your dad's argument starts to break down.  The Earth is at apohelion around the first week of July and at perihelion the first week of January.  In other words, there are more seconds in a solar day in the winter than there are in the summer.  The tilt of the Earth is more significant, so there are still more seconds in a solar day near the summer solstice than either equinox, even if the longest solar day (noon to noon) isn't in the summer.\n\nThe biggest reason his argument breaks down is sheer magnitude.  The variation in the length of a solar day is in seconds/day while the difference in the amount of daylight/darkness can be minutes/day (the amount of variation depends on a person's latitude)\n\nFor 2006, the longest daytime period will be on Jun 21, with the shortest nightime period being Jun 20 or 21 (the Naval Observatory's charts only list hours and minutes)."

"2","Has anyone pulled energy from the quantum field, a la Tesla?","Tesla seemed to be on the verge but, Mr. J P Morgan pulled his funding. We need this now, more than ever.","It depends on what you mean by a ""quantum field.""\n\nOne sense, which is wrong, is used by various cranks to add the illusion of scientific accuracy. They use it more or less randomly to spice up their descriptions. Other popular words are: vibration, frequency, and zero-point energy (all of which are actual terms when used in the right context.)\n\nThe other (correct) sense is used in modern physics. But while there is Quantum Field Theory there is not  a physical entity called a simply a ""quantum field."" You need to have a field of something, for instance electromagnetism, and then treat it using the precepts of Quantum Mechanics. Other more complicated quantum fields are used to describe electrons inside a superconductor.\n\nAs for Tesla he was an excellent inventor who was unlucky in business and due to the machinations of rivals. He was correct in understanding the AC was superior to DC for transmitting electrical current (contrary to Edison), and did a lot of early work in Radio - probably before Marconi. \n\nUnfortunately today various crank scientific theories and crackpot ""free energy"" inventions toss his name around, using his reputation as being ""right but unrewarded"" to someone make their own theories seem right. (In other words, ""people didn't listen to Tesla, so when they say I am a crank they are just a wrong"" - common crank logic.)\n\nSo, I don't think there is anything here to investigate, I'm afraid. Tesla didn't pull energy from a ""quantum field."""
"1","Why is it important to be respectful and obedient?","","2 separate topics here:\n\n1) Respectful - The more respect you show, the more respect you will be shown.  You earn respect...it is not just handed out to people.  That 80 year old war vet earned our respect, and he should be treated as such.  Always treat people with respect, unless you know exactly why they should not.\n\n2) Obedient - This depends on the question, ""to whom.""  To father and mother, yes.  They are responsible for you, and they are your parents.  You should listen to them and do as they say.  To teachers, yes.  Same as above.  To God, yes, same as above.\nTo any others, use your best sense of judgment.  Treat them with respect, but use judgment before blindly being obedient.  After all, you are a human...not a dog."

"2","what do u no about a auroch?","its like some thin that were working on in science","Aurochs (Bos primigenius) are considered to have probably been one of the wild forebears of modern cattle.  They were rather fierce tempered creatures, and prefered habitat which included both forested and open areas (rather similar to what white-tailed deer prefer), rather than bald prairie habitat.  They were larger than modern cattle, up to 6 feet at the shoulder, and with nasty upcurving horns that could easily gore a person.\n\nThey are well represented in cave art going back tens of thousands of years, and were also important in the religions of many early Near-Eastern settlements, such as Catal Huyuk.  Aurochs are also used in heraldry, and remain on the coat of arms of several nations.\n\nAurochs went extinct in Europe (Poland) in the seventeenth century, mostly due to habitat loss.  They were incapatable with the more intensive agriculture that was being practised across Europe.  By the time some conservation measures were implemented (even nobles weren't allowed to hunt them by the end, and gamekeepers were encouraged to clear land for them to graze) it was already too late."
"3","why does hair turn grey in older mamals ?","","Hair is an interesting biological structure. What we usually think of as 'hair' is really just the part we see... that's the hair shaft, which contains pigment (a chemical that gives color to things). There is also a hair follicle, which is a multi-cellular structure inside the skin of our scalp that creates the hair strand (making it grow), and also is responsible for the pigmentation. Some of the cells in the follicle make the chemical melanin, which is a skin and hair pigment in many species on our planet. \n\nHair turns grey when the pigment cells in the hair follicle stop making melanin. When this happens due to aging, it's mostly under the control of the genes we inherit. Long periods of constant stress may also contribute, but a big shock won't turn hair grey overnight."

"1","If the serenity prayer states ""the courage to change the things I can""?","then why do people think abortion is wrong?","gaaaah. Clarity is needed!!!!   Serenity Prayer is NOT from the bible.

It was also theorized that Neibuhr credited a 18th CE theologican Fredrich Oetinger for writing the Prayer.  ANother possible origin of the prayer might have come from a book ""Between Dawn & Dark"" (1957) by Fredrick Ward Kates that went like this:\n\nAlmighty God, our heavenly father, give us serenity to accept what cannot be changed, courage to change what should be changed, and wisdom to know the one from the other.\n\nThe LONG version that Neibuhr wrote went like this.  It was used for A.A. mostly.\n\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nLiving one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time,\naccepting hardship as the pathway to peace.\n\nTaking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it.\nTrusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to his Will.\nThat I may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely happy with Him forever in the next.\nAmen."

"1","Is dying on a cross the worst way possible to die, or are there worse ways?","I have heard people suggest that what Jesus went through was the worst pain that anyone could go through.  Should this assertion be analyzed?  If it´s true that many people volunteer to be crucified every year, then can it really be the worst torture possible?  Did Hypatia, who was skinned alive, die a worse death?  Did many people who were boiled alive, flayed with red-hot pincers, and burned slowly after being coated with oil, die a much worse death?  If Jesus died early on the cross, then did the other two themselves on the other crosses suffer even more?  Is it common to be whipped before being crucified, and if so, have many people been whipped 39 times in a similar fashion?  Did Paul himself say that he was whipped thusly on three separate occasions?  Was the whole process that Jesus went through a normal procedure in Roman times?  Were many other people whipped, forced to carry a cross, and crucified?","Well not that cruxifiction is a walk in the park but YES, there are more painful deaths, ironically some of them were contrived by the very same Church trying to ensure EVERYONE believed the doctrine of Christianity as they saw it during the Inquisition. \n\nSome of their death/torture methods\n\nFlaying- Skinning a person alive and rubbing salt into the raw flesh\n\nDisembowelment- You can imagine for yourself\n\nHung, Drawn and Quatertered- Like the name says\n\nBeing tossed unto spikes- If the landing was not a well aimed one, your death would not be mercifully short. \n\nAmazing how barbaric humans can be."

The tracks were found at the bottom of a three-foot thick layer of sandstone overlaying mudstone. The fossil evidence indicates that the Johnson farm was located along the margins of a shallow saline lake 200 million years ago. As the water receded, dinosaurs walking through the leftover clay left impressions of their feet including scales of their skin and prints of their toes. As the mud hardened, cracks around the tracks formed. Eventually the lake level rose and buried the tracks with sand and silt. Over time the sand hardened and became sandstone thus preserving the dinosaur tracks. Within the three-foot sandstone blocks are several track-forming layers."

Any intelligent commentary would be much appreciated.","First of all, you do not have and immortal soul, if you did, then why had no one gone to Heaven before Jesus came to the Earth, 4000 years had came & gone since Adam & Eve, millions of people had died, what did Jesus say to a man of the Pharisees, Nic·o·de'mus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.\n\nJohn 3:13\nMoreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.\n\nJesus Christ spoke about the condition of the dead. He did so with regard to Lazarus, a man whom he knew well and who had died. Jesus told his disciples: “Lazarus our friend has gone to rest.” The disciples thought that Jesus meant that Lazarus was resting in sleep, recovering from an illness. They were wrong. Jesus explained: “Lazarus has died.” (John 11:11-14) Notice that Jesus compared death to rest and sleep. Lazarus was neither in heaven nor in a burning hell. He was not meeting angels or ancestors. Lazarus was not being reborn as another human. He was at rest in death, as though in a deep sleep without dreams. Other scriptures also compare death to sleep. For example, when the disciple Stephen was stoned to death, the Bible says that he “fell asleep.” (Acts 7:60) Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote about some in his day who had “fallen asleep” in death.  1 Corinthians 15:6.\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that the dead “are conscious of nothing at all.” They are not alive and have no conscious existence anywhere. The account of Lazarus confirms this. Upon returning to life, did Lazarus thrill people with descriptions of heaven? Or did he terrify them with horrible tales about a burning hell? No. The Bible contains no such words from Lazarus. During the four days that he was dead, he had been “conscious of nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Lazarus had simply been sleeping in death.  John 11:11.\nThe account of Lazarus also teaches us that the resurrection is a reality, not a mere myth. Jesus raised Lazarus in front of a crowd of eyewitnesses. Even the religious leaders, who hated Jesus, did not deny this miracle. \n\nThink about this too: If Lazarus had been in heaven for those four days, would he not have said something about it?—  And if he had been in heaven, would Jesus have made him come back to earth from that wonderful place?   Of course not!\n\nYet, many people say that we have a soul, and they say that the soul lives on after the body dies. They say that Lazarus’ soul was alive somewhere. But the Bible does not say that. It says that God made the first man Adam “a living soul.” Gen. 2:7,  Adam was a soul. The Bible also says that when Adam sinned, he died. He became a “dead soul,” and he returned to the dust from which he had been made. The Bible also says that all Adam’s offspring inherited sin and death too.\n\nThe Scriptural teaching of the resurrection, however, is not compatible with the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. If an immortal soul survived death, no one would need to be resurrected, or brought back to life. Indeed, Martha expressed no thought about an immortal soul that was living on elsewhere after death. She did not believe that Lazarus had already gone to some spirit realm to continue his existence. On the contrary, she showed her faith in God’s purpose to reverse the effects of death. She said: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.” (John 11:23, 24) Likewise, Lazarus himself related no experiences of some afterlife. There was nothing to report.\n\nClearly, according to the Bible, the soul dies and the remedy for death is the resurrection. You enjoy the best sleep ever, until Jesus resurrects you, sometime in the future."

"2","wat is difference between ac and dc starters?","","An automobile has a DC (direct current) battery and therefore uses a DC starter.  Current flows in only one direction just as in a flashlight with batteries.\n\nMany snowblowers can be plugged into an AC (alternating current) outlet in the garage and use AC starters.  Current flows in opposite directions through the starter completing 60 cycles every second.  The voltage rises from zero to a peak drops to zero and continues to a negative peak before returning back to zero once each cycle.  The graph of voltage with respect to time forms a sinusoid."

"3","what are allergies and intolerances ?","","Allergies are the body's inappropriate reaction to a normally benign protein, which the body sees as an invader. Note that allergies are ALWAYS to a protein. Intolerances as well as sensitivities are different from allergies in that it is not necessarily to a protein - such as lactose intolerance - but can produce similar symptoms.\n\nThe immune system is designed to watch for and attack invading cells which come into our bodies, such as viruses and bacteria. Sometimes, though, the immune system sees something which isn't bad for us, such as pollen, dander, even foods, as an invader, and it goes on the attack. Mast cells rush to the scene, releasing their load of chemicals, and calling in other inflammatory cells of the immune system, such as basophils and Killer T-cells. All the chemicals these cells release are what cause the symptoms of allergy, including hives, running nose, itchy eyes, sneezing, coughing, etc. One of the main chemicals involved is histamine, which is why antihistamines (also known as histamine blockers) are prescribed for allergies."

This words means that there are some people who immortal until Jesus 2nd coming (is it related to 1000 years kingdom?). Is it true?what do you think?If it's true, have anyone met those guys already?i would like to meet them","JESUS has come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, and he is teaching a crowd that includes his apostles.

About a week later, Jesus takes Peter, James, and John along with him, and they climb a lofty mountain. Possibly it is at night, since the disciples are sleepy. While Jesus is praying, he is transfigured before them. His face begins to shine as the sun, and his garments become brilliant as light.\n\nHow strengthening this vision proves to be, both to Jesus and to the disciples! The vision is, as it were, a preview of Christ’s Kingdom glory. The disciples saw, in effect, “the Son of man coming in his kingdom,” just as Jesus had promised a week earlier.

Extreme temperatures affect that.

"2","name of devastating hurricanes?","","In the Atlantic basin, at least two storms have killed more than 10,000 people. Hurricane Mitch during the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season caused severe flooding and mudslides in Honduras, killing about 18,000 people and changing the landscape enough that entirely new maps of the country were needed. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900, which made landfall at Galveston, Texas as an estimated Category 4 storm, killed 8,000 to 12,000 people, and remains the deadliest natural disaster in the history of the United States. The deadliest Atlantic storm on record was the Great Hurricane of 1780, which killed about 22,000 people in the Antilles.\n\n \nThe relative sizes of Typhoon Tip, Tropical Cyclone Tracy, and the United States.The most intense storm on record was Typhoon Tip in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 1979, which had a minimum pressure of only 870 mbar and maximum sustained wind speeds of 190 mph (305 km/h). It weakened before striking Japan. Tip does not hold the record for fastest sustained winds in a cyclone alone; Typhoon Keith in the Pacific, and Hurricane Camille and Hurricane Allen in the North Atlantic currently share this record as well [15], although recorded wind speeds that fast are suspect, since most monitoring equipment is likely to be destroyed by such conditions.\n\nCamille was the only storm to actually strike land while at that intensity, making it, with 190 mph (305 km/h) sustained winds and 210 mph (335 km/h) gusts, the strongest tropical cyclone of record to ever hit land. For comparison, these speeds are encountered at the center of a strong tornado, but Camille, like all tropical cyclones, was much larger and long-lived than any tornado.\n\nTyphoon Nancy in 1961 had recorded wind speeds of 213 mph (343 km/h), but recent research indicates that wind speeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high, and this is no longer considered the fastest storm on record. [16] Similarly, a gust caused by Typhoon Paka over Guam was recorded at 236 mph (380 km/h); however, this reading had to be discarded, since the anemometer was damaged by the storm. Had it been confirmed, this would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded at the Earth's surface. (The current record is held by a non-hurricane wind registering 231 mph (372 km/h) at Mount Washington in New Hampshire.) [17]\n\nTip was also the largest cyclone on record, with a circulation 1,350 miles (2,170 km) wide. The average tropical cyclone is only 300 miles (480 km) wide. The smallest storm on record, 1974's Cyclone Tracy, which devastated Darwin, Australia, was roughly 30 miles (50 km) wide. [18]\n\nHurricane Iniki in 1992 was the most powerful storm to strike Hawaii in recorded history, hitting Kauai as a Category 4 hurricane, killing six and causing $3 billion in damage.\n\n \nThe first recorded South Atlantic hurricaneOn March 26, 2004, Cyclone Catarina became the first recorded South Atlantic hurricane. Previous South Atlantic cyclones in 1991 and 2004 reached only tropical storm strength. Hurricanes may have formed there prior to 1960 but were not observed until weather satellites began monitoring the Earth's oceans in that year.\n\nA tropical cyclone need not be particularly strong to cause memorable damage; Tropical Storm Allison in June 2001 had its name retired for killing 41 people and causing over $5 billion damage in East Texas, even though it never became a hurricane; the damage from Allison was mostly due to flooding, not winds or storm surge. Hurricane Jeanne in 2004 was only a tropical storm when it made a glancing blow on Haiti, but the flooding and mudslides it caused killed over 3,000 people.\n\nOn August 29 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana and Mississippi. The U.S. National Hurricane Center, in its August review of the tropical storm season stated that Katrina is probably the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. Its death toll is above 1300, mainly from flooding and the aftermath. It is also es"

"3","how do I get over being hungover?","I feel really sick after the night I drink and it goes on around a day long. Is it my stomach or what? I'd appreciate your help about that. And","Dehydration is what causes a hang over.  Alcohol sucks the nutrients out of your body and gives you no real nutritional value.  I would suggest before going to bed to drink Gatorade or some other electrolyte drink (Powerade, Altima, Energy Water).  This will slowly start to replenish you, though if you drank a lot, you'll need more.\n\nBe sure to drink a lot of water throughout the day and eat some bread (which will absorb some of the alcohol).  Nutritious food through out the day will also help.\n\nIf you feel really, really sick the night before, you could always throw up, drink some gatorade, sleep a lot, you're more likely to wake up refreashed."
"1","is behaviour based on the circumstances in which you are raised or do inherent tendencies hold a stronger sway","why do people who are raised by loving, moral families sometimes commit acts that are amoral?","Ahhh...nature versus nurture!  Even the experts cannot say with certainty whether nature and your genetic makeup or your nurturing is what makes up the person. There have been studies done with twins who were raised apart, and found that the twins had MANY things that they did just alike, from little things such as which hand they used to open a letter to bigger things such as they body-type and coloring of the people they fell in love with!  There have also been many studies done as to how poverty, violence, drug/alcohol abuse, sexual/physical abuse and parental abandonment affects children, especially in the birth to age 4 range, and how this shows up in their later life as violence in men and self-abuse in women. So having said all this, I personally feel that it is a combination of both, and sometimes it is neither. There are always the stories of the family who did everything right and still wound up with a drug addicted child or a murderer or rapist on their hands. But if you take a 'normal' family and have them raise a child (by normal I mean average, honest, working, functioning people)you will by and large see differences in that child as compared to a child raised by a disfunctional, abusive, out of control, self-serving family.

The difference in t2g and eg levels (∆o) determines whether a complex is low or high spin.

But here's the thing you have to consider ...\n\nA few months ago, I was figuring out a similar route, but using Anchorage and Vancouver instead.  To and from Alaska, you have to take the Alaska Highway through Watson Lake, B.C. (or maybe that's in the Yukon).\n\nAnyway, there are two choices at Watson Lake.  One is the Alaska Highway toward Edmonton, then down through Prince George, B.C., and over to Smithers on Hwy. 16, I think.\n\nThe alternative is to go down the Stewart-Cassier Highway (Hwy. 37) in western B.C.  This road is they most direct route between Smithers and Watson Lake ... going through Prince George is a lot longer.\n\nThe problem is that mapquest doesn't want to route you along Hwy. 37.  You have to force it by routing yourself through a town along that road.  (Then it works.)  Mapquest tries very hard to keep you off Hwy. 37, saying that portions are unpaved, that you'll average 16 mph, etc., etc.\n\nDon't believe it.  Unless you're going at a bad time of year, that route is okay, and it's very scenic.  Make sure you gas up everywhere you can, and you'll be alright."

Health e mail.\n\nThe following diet myths come up over and over again at my nutrition center. My next two blog entries will help set the record straight. Hope you find this helpful! \n\nIf you eat late at night, the food turns straight into fat.\n\nNot true.If your overall calories are appropriate for weight loss, you certainly can eat something after dinner. Late night calories will ultimately get used the next day (and even while you sleep). \n\nHowever, for the sake of energy, it is always better to eat your calories during the day when your body needs the fuel. Plus, eating consistently throughout the day will stabilize blood sugar levels -- so you’ll feel energized and experience fewer cravings. If you are going to snack after dinner, I suggest choosing something 250 calories or less.\n\n\n\nFresh fruits and vegetables are more nutritious than frozen.\n\nNot necessarily. Frozen can be a great produce option (just avoid varieties with added salt, sugar, and sauce). Frozen foods are picked in the peak of ripeness, then frozen. You can eat them as you need them -- and most of the nutrients are locked in. On the other hand, fresh fruit and vegetables are typically harvested before they ripen, and can have nutrient variability. Also, the longer fresh produce sits around in your fridge, the less nutrients it will contain. \n\nBottom line: Buy both fresh and frozen and eat as much as you can.\n\nCravings are your body's way of telling you it needs something.\n\nThis has never been proven. You normally crave what you like to eat (or smell or see someone else eating). Also, hormonal changes are sometimes responsible for food cravings. Ice cream and pickles anyone?\n\nAny type of water is always better than soda.\n\nNo. There are a few caloric waters with sexy marketing ploys. In fact, some brands have quite a bit of sugar. Always check labels.\n\nCertain foods, like grapefruit, celery, or cabbage soup can burn fat and make you lose weight. \n\nThese are anecdotal stories that have no scientific back up. It’s true these foods are low in calories, but they do NOT actually burn fat .\n\n\nI would love to paste the links here for you but Yahoo! considers that spam and advertising."

"3","Is it possible for a woman who is in menopause to take fertility treatments to become pregnant?","","Here is what I found: \n\nKnowing whether or not you are menopausal is important since pregnancy is still possible.  http://www.epigee.org/menopause.html\n\nOnce menopause has occurred, there are no longer eggs within the ovary. The only way to achieve a pregnancy is with the use of egg donation. Egg donation is widely available across the United States and many other countries. Most programs will either provide an anonymous egg donor or work with a younger egg donor of your choice.\nThe egg donor receives daily injections of medication to stimulate the development of the eggs. Once the follicles are mature, the donor receives an injection of hCG to trigger maturation of the egg. About 36 hours later, the eggs are ""harvested"" during an egg retrieval procedure performed under intravenous sedation. The eggs are taken to the laboratory and mixed with sperm from your partner or a donor if you so choose. If there is a male fertility problem, a technique called ICSI (sperm injection) offers many men the opportunity to fertilize the eggs, where previously that was not possible. \n\nWhile all this is going on, the recipient is receiving medication to synchronize the growth of the uterine lining so it is ready to accept the embryos at the appropriate time. This can be tricky, but the steps have been worked out, and in most women the success rates with egg donation are even higher than normal IVF. \n\nOne word of caution: Pregnancy in older women can be associated with increased risks of complications such as eclampsia, seizures, stroke and death. A thorough medical evaluation must be carried out before entering into the program.  http://health.ivillage.com/gyno/gynomenopause/0,,677t,00.html"

"3","What is a kundalini or sokrlung experience. I meditated for two months and felt warm now i have mental illness","","Asian traditions recognize a number of pitfalls associated with intensive meditation practice, such as altered perceptions that can be frightening, and ""false enlightenment,"" associated with delightful or terrifying visions (Epstein, 1990). Epstein (1990) describes a ""specific mental disorder that the Tibetans call 'sokrlung' (a disorder of the 'life-bearing wind that supports the mind' that can arise as a consequence...of strain[ing] too tightly in an obsessive way to achieve moment-to-moment awareness"" (p. 27). When meditative practices are transplanted into Western contexts, the same problems can occur. Anxiety, dissociation, depersonalization, altered perceptions, agitation, and muscular tension have been observed in western meditation practitioners (Bogart, 1991; Walsh & Roche, 1979). Yet Walsh and Roche (1979) point out that ""such changes are not necessarily pathologic and may reflect in part a heightened sensitivity"" (p. 1086)."

If four hot sticks are chosen at random from the box, what is the probability that no more than one will be orange?   Round your answer to one decimal place.","since it is ""at least"", use 1-(probability of no aces or no kings), so:\n\n1-((44/52)*(43/51))\n\nfor the second problem, I would use the idea of (probability of no orange + probability of one orange), so:\n\nprob of no orange:\n((5/8)*(4/7)*(3/6)*(2/5))\n\nprob of one orange, assuming you've learned combinations and permutations:\n(3C1*5C3)/8C4\n\nadd the two prob from above.\n\nhope this helps...probabilty can be quite ambiguous."

"1","what do you consider low maintenance??","Low maintenance boy/girl??","A low maintenance girl:\n\n1.  Isn't preoccupied with money.  A date walking through the mall can be as enjoyable as a $150 concert ticket and dinner afterwards.\n\n2.  Doesn't complain easily.  If a date doesn't work out as planned or hoped they laugh it off and make the most of a broken situation.\n\n3.  Doesn't need constant attention to every single one of her needs.  She can solve many problems on her own.\n\n4.  Isn't bitchy or annoying with everything she says or with every opinion she articulates.\n\n5.  Doesn't have to be the center of attention all of the time--is content to allow the spotlight to shine on others sometimes.\n\nOf course the exact same things apply to a guy also.  Guys can be just as high maintenance as girls can be."

"1","Why do heterosexual tell us as much, when defending homosexuals?","I have been reading many questions and answers on this site today, about being proud of being gay, defending it, rants about the homophobes. The disturbing issue here is that in nearly all the posts I’ve read, and I read at least 30, the heterosexuals who wrote amazing nodes, I mean succinct, intelligent, and well written, all had to write: ""I'm not a homosexual"" or ""I'm a heterosexual"".\n\nWhy is this? Who cares what your preference is? You just finished writing that you didn't care, that you were cool with homosexuals etc. By telling us all that you in fact are not homosexual in a homosexual post, is quite indicative of not really being okay with the whole thing. Your sexual preference was not an issue; it had no relevance to the post.\nSexual preference has no weight in measuring a person's self worth, so why tell us you are or are or are not?","They want to disillusion the bigots who seem to think that it's gay vs. straight instead of smart vs. ignorant."

"1","How would you feel it you knew there wasn't a God?","","It wouldn't matter much to me one way or the other.  However, I think to most the lack of a higher power means we have to accept:\n\n- Responsibility for learning, instead of defaulting everything to God\n- That we are alone\n- That bad things happen without an evil force to guide them\n- That good things happen without a just force to guide them\n- That there is no divine justice\n- That there is no afterlife.  When we die, we're done.\n- That we cannot seek comfort outside of our own society\n- That we cannot change unfortunate events, or inspire fortunate ones simply by praying.\n\nThat's a LOT for people some people to deal with.  So, I think it would be easy for those who have already dealt with some of these things, and devistating for those who haven't."
"2","what makes fresh snow white?","","A beam of white sunlight entering a snow bank is so quickly scattered by a zillion ice crystals and air pockets that most of the light comes bouncing right back out of the snow bank. What little sunlight is absorbed by snow is absorbed equally over the wavelengths of visible light thus giving snow its white appearance."
"2","Is it possible that there could be lifeforms somewhere that are silicon-based rather than carbon?","","The reason all life on Earth is carbon based is because of some of the unique qualities of the element, such as the way it binds to other elements (it's quite complicated to explain - just trust me on this point!)\n\nSilicone shares enough of these qualities to make it a viable alternative to carbon in terms of organic life. We're not sure why carbon ended up being the basis of life on Earth - it may be pure chance. However, if there is life on other planets, then (as far as we know) it would be based either on carbon or silicon."

The inheritance can be invested. If he starts to save now until 60, how much should he save per month at the end of each month, if all money can be compounded monthly at 7% annual rate at all times.","I'm using the financial apps package on the TI-83.\nAt 7% annual for 10 years the $200,000 will grow to $401,932.  To withdraw $6000 a month for 25 years he'll need $848,921, which is $446,989 more than he'll get from investing the $200,000.  So he'll need to put $312.93 a month into his retirement fund."
"3","How do you integrate the alters in a Dissociative Identity Disorder patient?","","Assuming that the patient has agreed that this is the best course, there are several ways of integrating alters.  Some people I know have used hypnosis, others have used psychotherapy.  The most important work is the work of the patient in wanting to integrate, keeping the ""strengths"" of each of the alters while discarding what the patient feels are negatives.  It might help to thank the alters, though in one video I saw the patient felt the need to sort of ""trick"" the alters into integration.\n\nIt is important to get professional help in doing this.\n\nThis answer could be much longer, but that's the short answer.  Hope it helps\nDana"

"2","what are the two parts of the life cycle of a slime mold?","","After the spore germinates, single cells will aggregate into a motile phase.  This is called either a plasmodium or pseudoplasmodium depending upon the species.  The motile phase moves like an amoeba or slug.\n\nWhen a suitable location is found (in terms of light and moisture) the motile phase becomes stationary and develops fruiting bodies either sexually or asexually (again species dependent).  The fruiting bodies release spores to continue a new cycle.\n\nSee additional material below:"

I initially didnt want to call her a racist (more along the lines of *racially tense*), but her comments have become a constant prejudgement. I was just wondering if anyone else has ever dealt with a person like this and if so, what would you say to someone like that. \n\nIs it because she feels lower than whites or what??","She might feel lower than whites or has been brain washed by other haters.\nI usually give up on people like that because it is hard to make a person care once they have hate in their minds."

For the record, I apologize for the original questioner's existence.","Someone was asking about White supremicists and I replied ""enough already about the White Supremacy"" and got a violation.\nIt's Q&A so much for your opinion, apparently it was because i didnt answer the question.

A clap of thunder can typically register about 120 dBA, or ten times louder than a garbage truck, chain saw or pneumatic drill.

Government grants are faught over like drunk women in bars, there's never enough money to do what you want, the budgets are tight, the sacrifice is huge... but the rewards are potentially worth it. When you get to college enroll in a research program as an assistant and see first hand what these scientific endeavors are really like... and be prepared to meet brilliant nerdy people who may judge you harshly if your religious beliefs stand in the way of open minded scientific research, and strict adherence to the known laws of physics including accepted theory about the origins of the universe and stuff like that which makes some Christians squeamish."

"3","Erosion on Womb?","Went for a smear the morning.  As if its not bad enough my womb is titled quite badly, then i found out i have an erosion on my womb.  Has anyone else ever had this and if so is there anything i should be concerned with?","When you go for a smear, the doctor or nurse collects some of the cells from the neck of the womb onto the stick. When these cells are examined, if they are womb cells instead of cervical cells, this is called an erosion. \n\nIt is simply that the margin where the change takes place has shifted slightly and the lining becomes a bit raw as a result. \n\nOne easy way to think about it, is to think about your mouth. The surface of you lip is different from the surface of the gum inside your lip. At a certain point the two surfaces meet and change. \n\nImagine what would happen if this margin moved. You'd have some lining from the gum facing the outside world, exposed to the air. It's likely this would lead to a raw patch. This is the kind of thing that is happening in an erosion. \nis more common in women who are taking the Pill and might relate to hormone levels. \n\nTreatment is mostly just leaving it alone. More than likely it will get better by itself. Sometimes the surface needs to be treated with a local anaesthetic and cautery."

Religion should be one of the categories for quesions. Instead I put it under Science","Yes, the experiment was done out but it was an experiment with huge flaws in it; a few of the bodies gained original weight back after a short passage of time, one gained weight after death, the way he did it was suspect, and the sample size was far too small to have any conclusive evidence.\nIt's also believed that he poisoned the ""dying"" dogs.\n\nSo, in short, the ""soul"" does not weight 21 grams as there is no real proof."

Usually, if someone ticks me off, I can often see their side, I think I work harder at dropping my anger when it is outwards rather than inwords.  What is your experience with this matter?","i try to avoid anger, it's a counterproductive emotion and i almost never display it.  for me, frustration is much more common.\n\nbut for the sake of your question, i would rather be angry at myself than at you.  if i did something stupid enough to earn that self-inflicted anger, i'd have no one else to blame.  i'd try and figure out why i did what i did, and how it could be made up, to me or to others.  i must answer to myself every time i look in the mirror, and if anger is my response, well then i must have done something stupid to warrant it.  and i know i can find it in me to forgive myself. :)\n\nif i'm angry with YOU, it's likely going to be accompanied by a fair bit of frustration as well.  and since YOU earned my wrath (i'm not really scary at all, don't worry!) i'd feel upset; i think of myself as a very level-headed person.  what could you possibly do to get me to be that way?  and how can i turn the anger into something else?  this is much worse than being angry with myself, and far less predictable.  not a fan.  eventually, i'll ALWAYS forgive... but in the meantime...

"2","what is the amt of vaginal fluid discharged by females during intercourse.is too much wetting considered sick?","","Too much natural lubrication (wetness) during sex reduces pleasure for both partners. Females lose greater stimulation along the vaginal walls. Men lose out on the corresponding ‘tight’ sensation that they love. We all have an optimum level of friction that is required to enable heightened pleasure for both partners, thus leading to easier climax. This level of stimulation can most easily be obtained by experimenting with your wetness level. Sex could be much more satisfying than what you think it already is. \nA woman’s wetness level increases naturally as arousal increases. But for some ladies, even the slightest turn-on is enough to produce an extravagant amount of lubrication. If excess wetness is a problem for you, OR if you wish to simply experiment with different levels of wetness, seeking the most pleasurable ‘tight’ sensation for your man, what can you do?\n\nFirst, realize that there is more involved in sex than just the intercourse part of it. More women achieve orgasms by clitoral stimulation than by intercourse. However, intercourse is an intimate act & should be satisfying when possible. If it is not enjoyable, then a couple will more than likely become romantically distant. \nSecondly, you should see your doctor to be sure there is no infection, abnormalities, or other problem causing your excess wetness, especially if it is something new. \n\nI can understand what they're saying (above), but there are lots of different things to try and experiment with positions etc- it can't be as bad as too dry, which would be painful and awkward..."

I have never seen one word published on this fact.","Yes.  There was some lead content in the tube until they discovered a few things.  For one thing, the lead pulled the fluoride OUT of the toothpaste so that all the benefits shown in the laboratory were missing after the toothpaste had been in the tube for a couple of months.  Most of the lead was thereby tied up in the tube and not released into the toothpaste, so the contributions of toothpaste tubes to lead poisoning is questionable, but the possibility that it was doing harm was another reason to discontinue the use of lead in toothpaste tubes.  Also, do a search on ""lead poisoning toothpaste"" and you will find thousands of references.  Leaded gas and house paints are far and away the greatest historical threat to the general public concerning lead poisoning."

"2","why combustion of alkenes require lesser amount of O2 but burns with sootier flame?","Will the flame less sooty if we use more O2?? I do not think so but I would like to confirm.","To understand this question, you need to know what kind of product will be produced during a combustion. Generally, for a complete combustion of a hydrocarbon (contains only H and C), the product will be H2O and CO2. Depending on the C and H content in the hydrocarbon, you will produce different amount of H2O and CO2. \n\nOn the other hand, if it is an incomplete combustion (with limited supply of O2), apart from CO2 and H2O, you may also produce C and CO. The relative amount between them varies depending on the amount of O2 that is made available. With very limited amount of O2, more C (soot) will be produced. This leads to the ""sooty"" flame you are seeing.\n\nIn order to explain why generally alkenes require less O2 to burn compared to alkanes, let's compare ethane (2 C alkane) and ethene (2 C alkene). \n\nEthane has a formula C2H6 while ethene has a formula C2H4. Their corresponding balanced equation for combustion are:\n\nC2H6 + 7/2 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O\nC2H4 + 3 O2 → 2CO2 + 2 H2O\n\nAs you see, since both compounds have same number of C, they both produce 2 mole of CO2 for every mole of compound. However, since they have different number of H, the number of moles of H2O produced will be different. Since H2O has a fixed formula, in order to produce it, you need to supply O2. That's why the two compounds require different amount of O2.\n\nThe reason that you see a sooty flame is due to the fact that you don't have enough oxygen supply during the burning process. You can easily confirm this by using just a Bunsen burner (but be very carefully!!!). First, turn on your Bunsen burner with the air hole closed. The flame you see at the moment should be a luminous flame. It is golden yellow color. Now, if you carefully put a glass plate (hold with clamp or other device) on top of the flame and slowly move towards the tip of the burner (but don't cover it completely), you should see the plate will get ""darker"" by the flame. This is the soot produced during the combustion. Now, take away the plate, open the air hole in the burner to the max. You should see a the flame turns to blue. If you put the glass plate (with the soot marks) back to the flame, you can see the flame can slowly ""clean up"" the plate (if enough O2 is supplied with the flame) and the soot will disappear. The soot is turn back to CO2 due to the excess of O2."
"3","how does somebody get stroke as a sickness?","","Causes\n\n  Ischemic stroke  \nA stroke is sometimes called a brain attack. The problem is with the amount of blood in your brain. The cause of one type of stroke — ischemic stroke — is too little blood in the brain. The cause of the other main type of stroke — hemorrhagic stroke — is too much blood within the skull.\n\nIschemic stroke\nAbout 80 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes. They occur when blood clots or other particles block arteries to your brain and cause severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). This deprives your brain cells of oxygen and nutrients, and cells may begin to die within minutes. The most common ischemic strokes are:\n\nThrombotic stroke. This type of stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to your brain. A clot usually forms in areas damaged by atherosclerosis — a disease in which the arteries are clogged by an accumulation of cholesterol-containing fatty deposits (plaques). This process can occur within one of the two carotid (kuh-ROT-id) arteries of your neck that carry blood to your brain, as well as in other arteries. An ischemic stroke may also be caused by plaques that completely clog or markedly narrow an artery. This narrowing is called stenosis. \nEmbolic stroke. An embolic stroke occurs when a blood clot or other particle forms in a blood vessel away from your brain — commonly in your heart — and is swept through your bloodstream to lodge in narrower brain arteries. This type of blood clot is called an embolus. It's often caused by irregular beating in the heart's two upper chambers (atrial fibrillation). This abnormal heart rhythm can lead to poor blood flow and the formation of a blood clot. \nHemorrhagic stroke\n""Hemorrhage"" is the medical word for bleeding. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures. Hemorrhages can result from a number of conditions that affect your blood vessels, including uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) and weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms). A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) — a malformed tangle of thin-walled blood vessels, present at birth. There are two types of hemorrhagic stroke:\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage. In this type of stroke, a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain tissue, damaging cells. Brain cells beyond the leak are deprived of blood and are also damaged. High blood pressure is the most common cause of this type of hemorrhagic stroke. High blood pressure can cause small arteries inside your brain to become brittle and susceptible to cracking and rupture. \nSubarachnoid hemorrhage. In this type of stroke, bleeding starts in a large artery on or near the membrane surrounding the brain and spills into the space between the surface of your brain and your skull. A subarachnoid hemorrhage is often signaled by a sudden, severe ""thunderclap"" headache. This type of stroke is commonly caused by the rupture of an aneurysm, which can develop with age or result from a genetic predisposition. After a subarachnoid hemorrhage, vessels may go into vasospasm, a condition in which arteries near the hemorrhage constrict erratically, causing brain cell damage by further restricting or blocking blood flow to portions of the brain."

"2","What kind of science expriment should I do?","","By God, do NOT do any of the other ones listed above! Do something that has not been done before. Make your work theoretical. Pioneer in a field. A true scientist does not follow in the footsteps of others unless it is impossible to do anything other. Think of a present scientific problem: for example, the raging debate on whether or not dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Try to fight for one of the sides to prove their argument. I will not tell you how; I won't do your work for you. But, by God, don't rely on others to find you a science project, because they rarely think outside the box and only suggest what they have done or seen before. I wish you the best of luck. Make science proud!"

"1","Are Scottish people descendents of the Irish?","I mean, did their ancestors come from Ireland. I haven't gotten a good answer yet.","Igstrike is basically right, but that's not the whole story. When the Romans came to Scotland, they found two distinct populations, the Britons, speaking some dialect related to early Welsh, and the Picts in the far North, speaking a language unknown to us, which may or may not have been Indo-European - perhaps develpoed from the language of the pre-Celtic inhabitants.\n\nAfter the Romans left, thse two peoples were joined by Anglo-Saxons in the South, and Scots in the West, a tribe who crossed from Ireland, bringing with them the Gaelic language.\n\nSo the ""Scots"" were from Ireland; but today's Scottish people are descended from a mixture of all four peoples (plus newcomers).\n\nWorth noting that Gaelic, still spoken in the Western Isles, has never been spoken in more thatn half the country; Scots English is at least as authentically Scottish. The Picts and the Welsh were absorbed by the others."

"2","What is the procedure for screening of submergence tolerance in rice seedlings?","This is concerned with phenotyping methods of abiotic stress tolerance in rice crop. Any scientist working on submergence toleranc trait can aptl answer this question.","Submergence tolerance is an important characterisitc to breed into improved rice cultivars for rainfed lowland and deepwater areas. It may also be useful as a strategy for weed management in areas where rice is seeded directly into standing water, and deeper water levels (20cm) can be used for weed suppression. Genetic studies have been conducted (Mohanty et al. 1982; Haque et al. 1989), but the specific genes controlling tolerance have not been identified. \n    We studied the inheritance of submergence tolerance in a cross between the highly tolerant indica line IR40931-26-3-3-5 and the susceptible japonica line P1543851. IR40931-26 has a similar level of tolerance to FR13A, from which it derived the trait (Mackill et al. 1993). At 8 DAS, F3 families were subjected to 14-16 d submergence in greenhouse tanks. Individual plants were scored on a scale of 1 (tolerance) to 9 (susceptible) 1 wk after the water was removed. \n    Differences among F3 families were highly significant, and means ranged from 1.6 to 8.9, compared to 1.5 and 8.4 for the tolerant and susceptible families. DNA from the F2 plants giving rise to the nine most tolerant and most susceptible F2 families were bulked and assayed with 624 RAPD markers. Five RAPD bands associated with either the tolerant or susceptible families were asseyed on the entire F2 population. These five bands were linked to each other. RFLP markers from Cornell University, USA (McCouch et al. 1988), and from the Rice Genome Program, STAFF Institute, Tsukuba, Japan (Kurata et al. 1994) were used to map these RAPD markers to the end of chromosome 9 (Fig. 1). Analysis by Mapmaker/QTL (Lincoln et al. 1992) identified a locus near the RFLP"

"3","wat is the best way to treat dandruff?and acne??","","Dandruff is the excessive flaking of dead skin that forms on the scalp. As it is normal for skin cells to die and flake off, a small amount of flaking is normal and in fact quite common. Some people, however, either chronically or as a result of certain triggers, experience an unusually large amount of flaking, which can also be accompanied by redness and irritation. Most cases of dandruff can be treated with specialized shampoos or common household remedies which are available over the counter at your local pharmacy.\nDandruff can also be a symptom of seborrhea dermatitis, psoriasis, fungal infection or head lice. Excessive scratching should be avoided. Scratching to the point of causing breaks in the skin can increase the risk for infections, particularly from staph and strep bacteria. While these infections are the biggest risk from dandruff, many people find that dandruff can cause social or self-esteem issues, so treatment can be very important for purely social reasons. So it might be better if you had a check with your doctor on this. \nHowever I find that ""Garnier Anti- Dandruff"" shampoo and conditioner works well as using this on a regular basis keeps the dandruff at a low level as well as getting sufficient exercise and eating well and stress less. \nAs for acne it depends on how bad your case is as to what will work the best. When i was a bit younger i had fairly bad acne and i went to my doctor and she gave me pills for it. You could also try a number of household remedies for eg- \n- try putting some metho on a tissue and wiping the excess oil, doing this for a few day on and a few days off\n- my mother used to tell me to put toothpaste on face b4 i went to sleep which also helped \nIn conclusion i suggest to go and consult your doctor he/she maybe able to give you something or there are a number of herbal treatments.\nBest of all when you have found the product that works for you stil to it.\nGood luck as its a long road."

"2","explain 5 layers of epidermis?","","The Epidermis\n\nThe epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and protects the body from the environment. The thickness of the epidermis varies in different types of skin; it is only .05 mm thick on the eyelids, and is 1.5 mm thick on the palms and the soles of the feet. The epidermis contains the melanocytes (the cells in which melanoma develops), the Langerhans' cells (involved in the immune system in the skin), Merkel cells and sensory nerves. The epidermis layer itself is made up of five sublayers that work together to continually rebuild the surface of the skin: \n\nThe Basal Cell Layer\nThe basal layer is the innermost layer of the epidermis, and contains small round cells called basal cells. The basal cells continually divide, and new cells constantly push older ones up toward the surface of the skin, where they are eventually shed. The basal cell layer is also known as the stratum germinativum due to the fact that it is constantly germinating (producing) new cells.\n\nThe basal cell layer contains cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes produce the skin coloring or pigment known as melanin, which gives skin its tan or brown color and helps protect the deeper layers of the skin from the harmful effects of the sun. Sun exposure causes melanocytes to increase production of melanin in order to protect the skin from damaging ultraviolet rays, producing a suntan. Patches of melanin in the skin cause birthmarks, freckles and age spots. Melanoma develops when melanocytes undergo malignant transformation.\n\nMerkel cells, which are tactile cells of neuroectodermal origin, are also located in the basal layer of the epidermis. \n\nThe Squamous Cell Layer \nThe squamous cell layer is located above the basal layer, and is also known as the stratum spinosum or “spiny layer” due to the fact that the cells are held together with spiny projections. Within this layer are the basal cells that have been pushed upward, however these maturing cells are now called squamous cells, or keratinocytes. Keratinocytes produce keratin, a tough, protective protein that makes up the majority of the structure of the skin, hair, and nails. \n\nThe squamous cell layer is the thickest layer of the epidermis, and is involved in the transfer of certain substances in and out of the body. The squamous cell layer also contains cells called Langerhans cells. These cells attach themselves to antigens that invade damaged skin and alert the immune system to their presence. \n\nThe Stratum Granulosum & the Stratum Lucidum \nThe keratinocytes from the squamous layer are then pushed up through two thin epidermal layers called the stratum granulosum and the stratum lucidum. As these cells move further towards the surface of the skin, they get bigger and flatter and adhere together, and then eventually become dehydrated and die. This process results in the cells fusing together into layers of tough, durable material, which continue to migrate up to the surface of the skin.\n\nThe Stratum Corneum\nThe stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis, and is made up of 10 to 30 thin layers of continually shedding, dead keratinocytes. The stratum corneum is also known as the “horny layer,” because its cells are toughened like an animal’s horn. As the outermost cells age and wear down, they are replaced by new layers of strong, long-wearing cells. The stratum corneum is sloughed off continually as new cells take its place, but this shedding process slows down with age. Complete cell turnover occurs every 28 to 30 days in young adults, while the same process takes 45 to 50 days in elderly adults.\n\nThe Dermis\nThe dermis is located beneath the epidermis and is the thickest of the three layers of the skin (1.5 to 4 mm thick), making up approximately 90 percent of the thickness of the skin. The main functions of the dermis are to regulate temperature and to supply the epidermis with nutrient-saturated blood. Much of the body’s water supply is stored"
"2","What is the difference between the sun and a planet?????????","","Twertyto's answer is the best! When I was just learning about astronomy I asked the same question. Someone told me a very simple answer that just might work for you:  A planet reflects light and a star creates it. That sounds simple enough for simpler times! But now welcome to the 21st century!!!\nBrown dwarfs are kind of the ""animal"" that bridges these two seemingly different objects. Astronomy is having a hard (but fun) time right now trying to decide exactly what a planet is- from the very large to the very small. Is an object 75 times the size of Jupiter a planet? 79 times? 81 times? No one seems to know. Do we call them planets or officially name them Brown Dwarfs. On the other side of the issue, is Pluto a planet? They just discovered a larger than Pluto object and several almost-the-size-of-Pluto objects out past Pluto's orbit. Are all of these planets? If Pluto's not a planet, but now has been discovered to have at least 3 moons (two new one's were just discovered recently), then what do we call it? \nThis has been a surprisingly tough answer for Astronomers as well, so not only is it a great question, but you- and everyone else- might have to stick around for a while for the difinitive answer!!!"

And 11/17 is the conditional probability that Micron goes up if Gateway goes up, etc.)\n\nBased on the tree answer the following questions.\n\n\nWhat is the probability both stocks go up? \nWhat is the probability neither stock goes up? \n\nIf Gateway goes up, what is the conditional probability Micron goes up? \n\nIf Micron goes up, what is the conditional probability Gateway goes up? \n\nIf Micron does not go up, what is the conditional probab","I don't know how to show a tree diagram here on Yahoo, but you just do two branches (Gateway) showing 17/25 on one branch and 8/25 on the other.  Then draw two more from the top branch showing 11/17 and 8/17.  From the bottom branch draw two more showing 4/8 (1/2, of course) on both.\n\nBoth stocks went up on 11 of the 25 days, and on 4 of the 25 days neither went up.  (Notice I'm not quite saying the answer!)\n\nConditional prob can be tricky, but I think the Gateway/Micron one is just the prob on that branch of the tree.\nFor Micron/Gateway, do you know the formula\nprob(M and G) = prob(M)*conditional prob(G if M) ?\n\nWe know  prob(M and G) -- first answer.  We know prob(M) because we know Micron went up 15 of the 25 days, so this formula gives the required conditional prob."

After reading the column, take the suggest action at the bottom of this email. After you have read it, please forward it to your friends and family. \n\nAmerica, Not Keith Ellison, decides what book a congressman takes his oath on \nBy Dennis Prager - Tuesday, November 28, 2006 \n\nKeith Ellison, D-Minn., the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, has announced that he will not take his oath of office on the Bible, but on the bible of Islam, the Koran. \n\nHe should not be allowed to do so -- not because of any American hostility to the Koran, but because the act undermines American civilization. \n\nFirst, it is an act of hubris that perfectly exemplifies multiculturalist activism -- my culture trumps America's culture. What Ellison and his Muslim and leftist supporters are saying is that it is of no consequence what America holds as its holiest book; all that matters is what any individual holds to be his holiest book. \n\nForgive me, but America should not give a hoot what Keith Ellison's favorite book is. Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don't serve in Congress. In your personal life, we will fight for your right to prefer any other book. We will even fight for your right to publish cartoons mocking our Bible. But, Mr. Ellison, America, not you, decides on what book its public servants take their oath. \n\nDevotees of multiculturalism and political correctness who do not see how damaging to the fabric of American civilization it is to allow Ellison to choose his own book need only imagine a racist elected to Congress. Would they allow him to choose Hitler's ""Mein Kampf,"" the Nazis' bible, for his oath? And if not, why not? On what grounds will those defending Ellison's right to choose his favorite book deny that same right to a racist who is elected to public office? \n\nOf course, Ellison's defenders argue that Ellison is merely being honest; since he believes in the Koran and not in the Bible, he should be allowed, even encouraged, to put his hand on the book he believes in. But for all of American history, Jews elected to public office have taken their oath on the Bible, even though they do not believe in the New Testament, and the many secular elected officials have not believed in the Old Testament either. Yet those secular officials did not demand to take their oaths of office on, say, the collected works of Voltaire or on a volume of New York Times editorials, writings far more significant to some liberal members of Congress than the Bible. Nor has one Mormon official demanded to put his hand on the Book of Mormon. And it is hard to imagine a scientologist being allowed to take his oath of office on a copy of ""Dianetics"" by L. Ron Hubbard. \n\nSo why are we allowing Keith Ellison to do what no other member of Congress has ever done -- choose his own most revered book for his oath? \n\nThe answer is obvious -- Ellison is a Muslim. And whoever decides these matters, not to mention virtually every editorial page in America, is not going to offend a Muslim. In fact, many of these people argue it will be a good thing because Muslims around the world will see what an open society America is and how much Americans honor Muslims and the Koran. \n\nThis argument appeals to all those who believe that one of the greatest goals of America is to be loved by the world, and especially by Muslims because then fewer Muslims will hate us (and therefore fewer will bomb us). \n\nBut these naive people do not appreciate that America will not change the attitude of a single American-hating Muslim by allowing Ellison to substitute the Koran for the Bible. In fact, the opposite is more likely: Ellison's doing so wi","I am not sure how to respond to this but I do get alerts from AFA also... I will check it out ..Thanks for the Info..."

The poor often had to go to workhouses, or if they were lucky, they were sometimes employed as household servants. Alcoholism was rampant in the slums.

There was a high infant mortality rate among the poor.\n\nThis is a very loaded question, but I hope I gave some helpful information."

I've never seen a violent person from marijuana, but have seen people arrested from violence due to alcohol as well as seen family and friends turn blue from the alcohol.\n\nEurope manages this well in respects to alcohol.  They teach their kids to drink very early and teach them to moderate their consumption thus it becomes less of a problem when the children grow up and arent so concerned about getting trashed.  We need to take the novelty away from the children at an early age so it becomes less exciting in their teen age years.  Marijuana is less of an issue than is smoking and drinking.

"2","What would happen if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning?","","None of us would have to worry about what we going to do the next day because we would all be dead.\n\nWhat would happen if the Earth stopped spinning?\nThe probability for such an event is practically zero in the next few billion years. If the Earth stopped spinning suddenly, the atmosphere would still be in motion with the Earth's original 1100 mile per hour rotation speed at the equator. All of the land masses would be scoured clean of anything not attached to bedrock. This means rocks, topsoil, trees, buildings, your pet dog, and so on, would be swept away into the atmosphere. \n\nIf the process happened gradually over billions of years, the situation would be very different, and it is this possibility which is the most likely as the constant torquing of the Sun and Moon upon the Earth finally reaches it's conclusion. If the rotation period slowed to 1 rotation every 365 days a condition called 'sun synchronous', every spot in the Earth would have permanent daytime or nighttime all year long. This is similar to the situation on the Moon where for 2 weeks the front-side is illuminated by the Sun, and for 2 weeks the back side is illuminated. This situation for the Earth is not the condition of 'stopped' rotation, but it is as close as the laws of physics will let the Earth get. \n\n \n\nIf it stopped spinning completely...not even once every 365 days, you would get 1/2 year daylight and 1/2 year nightime. During daytime for 6 months, the surface temperature would depend on your latitude, being far hotter that it is now at the equator than at the poles where the light rays are more slanted and heating efficiency is lower. This long-term temperature gradient would alter the atmospheric wind circulation pattern so that the air would move from the equator to the poles rather than in wind systems parallel to the equator like they are now. The yearly change in the Sun's position in the sky would now be just its seasonal motion up and down the sky towards the south due to the orbit of the Earth and its axial tilt. As you moved along constant lines of Earth latitude, you would see the elevation of the Sun increase or decrease in the sky just as we now see the elevation of the Sun change from a single point on the Earth due to the Earth's daily rotation. \n\nFor example, if you were at a latitude of +24 degrees North in the Summer and at a longitude where the Sun was exactly overhead, it would slide gradually to the horizon as Fall approached, but since the Sun has moved 90 degrees in its orbit, it would now be due west. Then as we approach Winter, you would now be located on the dark side of the Earth, and would have to travel in longitude to a location 180 degrees around the Earth to see the Sun 1/2 way up the sky because in the Winter, the Sun is 48 degrees south of its summer location in the sky. It's a little confusing, but if you use a globe of the Earth and orient it the right way, you can see how all this works out. \n\nAs for other effects, presumably the magnetic field of the Earth is generated by a dynamo effect that involves its rotation. If the Earth stopped rotating, it's magnetic field would no longer be regenerated and it would decay away to some low, residual value due to the very small component which is 'fossilized' in its iron-rich rocks. There would be no more 'northern lights' and the Van Allen radiation belts would probably vanish, as would our protection from cosmic rays and other high-energy particles. This is a significant biohazard."

The earth is very big!  How can the entire earth exert a gravity force on a human pulling it straight down toward the centre?  The only logical, sensible answers are either;\n1) Gravity is primarily exerted at the closest point of contact from both entire bodies (using the attraction of both).  There is some evidence of this - Stand on your tippi-toes it hurts!\n2) Gravity is somehow exerted from the centre of a body to the centre of another body.\nThink before you answer!

Now it is true that at macroscopic or large distance scales, we understand gravity very well through Einstein's General Relativity Theory.

Can someone help?","Oxidative phosphorylation is the terminal process of cellular respiration in eukaryotes. During oxidative phosphorylation electrons are transferred from NADH or FADH2 — created in glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism and the Krebs cycle — to molecular oxygen, via a series of protein complexes located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space as a result of this flow of electrons. This generates a pH gradient and a transmembrane electrical potential across the membrane. This is a form of potential energy which is referred to as a proton-motive force. The protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix via a large protein complex, ATP synthase. This is how most of the ATP is created in a eukaryotic cell. This is the reaction that ATP synthase catalyses:\n\n\n\n\nADP3- + H+ + Pi ↔ ATP4- + H2O \n\nThe synthase functions almost as a mechanical motor, with each NADH molecule contributing enough proton motive force to generate 2.5 ATP. Each FADH2 molecule is worth 1.5 ATP. All together, the 10 NADH and 2 FADH2 molecules contributed through oxidation of glucose (glycolysis, conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, and the Krebs cycle) account for 23 of the 30 total ATP energy carrier molecules. It is worth noting that these ATP values are maximum values and in reality protons leak across the membrane causing somewhat lower values.\n\nPhotophosphorylation, which occurs when plants synthesize glucose during photosynthesis, also uses ATP synthase and a proton gradient to generate ATP. The process occurs across the thylakoid membrane when chlorophyll is energized by light and donates an excited electron to an electron transport chain.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Inhibitors \n2 See also \n3 External links \n4 References \n \n\n\n[edit] Inhibitors\nThere are a few well-known toxins that affect the process of oxidative phosphorylation and can lead to breakdown of the chain:\n\nCyanide interrupts the electron transport chain in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion because it binds more strongly than oxygen to the Fe3+ (ferric iron ion) in cytochrome a3, preventing this cytochrome from combining electrons with oxygen. \nOligomycin functions by inhibiting the ATP synthase protein and preventing it from generating ATP from the proton gradient. \nCCCP (m-chloro-carbonylcyanide-phenylhydrazine) destroys the proton gradient by allowing the protons to flow out of the membrane. Without the gradient, the ATP synthase cannot function and ATP synthesis breaks down. \nA detergent, or substance that destroys cellular membranes by breaking apart their lipid bilayers, will destroy the membrane used in the process and prevent a proton gradient. \nRotenone prevents the transfer of electrons from Fe-S centers in Complex I (most notably) to ubiquinone. The electrons entering into Complex I are those derived from NADH, and provide the bulk of the reducing potential to the electron transport chain. \nFor each of these toxins, a backup will cause everything before it to break down as well. For example, if oligomycin is added, protons cannot pass through. As a result, the H+ pumps are unable to pass protons through because the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH and FADH2 are then not oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because there are no NAD+ and FAD coenzymes to be reduced."

"3","Could a baby born with emphysema?","","It would be extremely  unlikely though there is a genetic disorder called alpha-1 antitrysin deficiency that may cause someone with the deficiency to develope emphysema  before the age of 40. In the case of a newborn I don't think its ever developed that quickly so if there is a breathing problem with a baby I think most doctors would look for another cause before even considering this because its extremely unlikely. There may be birth defects which cause symtoms much like emphysema and these too are rare.Ultrasounds are valuable tools to help discover these and they are often treatable and reversible."

"2","Does mercury literally melt gold to form an amalgam?","In recovery of gold, the raw material is typically treated with mercury, which forms an amalgam with the gold.  What is the actual process of ""forming an amalgam"".  Does this happen only between gold and mercury?","Miners used mercury (quicksilver) to recover gold throughout the western United States at both placer (alluvial) and hardrock (lode) mines. The vast majority of mercury lost to the environment in California was from placer-gold mines, which used hydraulic, drift, and dredging methods. At hydraulic mines, placer ores were broken down with monitors (or water cannons, fig. 1) and the resulting slurry was directed through sluices and drainage tunnels, where gold particles combined with liquid mercury to form gold-mercury amalgam. Loss of mercury in this process was 10 to 30 percent per season (Bowie, 1905), resulting in highly contaminated sediments at mine sites (fig. 2). Elevated mercury concentrations in present-day mine waters and sediments indicate that hundreds to thousands of pounds of mercury remain at each of the many sites affected by hydraulic mining.\n\n\nhope that helps"

"1","How do you feel when people speak language that you dint understand? Do you find it funny?","","Language is one of the best ways an individual can become a more integrated part of society. It is often a difficult and life-long learning process (to learn additional languages) but with tremendous benefits. Whenever I hear another language being spoken, I try to find the similarities that underlies all modern language. It inspires me to learn more about that particular language and also about the culture of the people that speak it. I suggest everyone should try to learn a few common phrases in any language, so that they may have the oppurtunity to communicate with someone you might not have otherwise ever thpught to do."
"1","Is soul eternal? why / how?","","The ""soul"" is definitely NOT eternal. Look back in Genesis 2:7 at the creation of Adam. Note closely what it said: ""....and he became a living soul."" It doesn't say God GAVE him a soul, it said Adam WAS the soul. Later on in the scriptures (Ezekiel 18:4) it says ""the soul that is sinning, it itself will die."" \n\nThe very notion of humans having some mysterious and separate soul that goes off somewhere at death is absurd, and completely against the Bible. Thank goodness we have God's word the Bible to clear up such gross misconceptions and wrong beliefs."
"2","What is the volume of wather of the biblical flood?","Highest Mountaint: 8848 m\nEarth radius R= 6 372 797 m\nSphere volume: V= 4 Pi R³/3\n\nWhat is the volume of wather?","What would have happened had all of the existent water in the atmosphere fallen during those forty days and forty nights? \n\nCalculations indicate that there is approximately 0.013 x 1015 m3 of water in the planet's atmosphere. This corresponds to approximately 13 x 1018cm3 of water. Now the questions looks like this: What would have happened if, during forty days and forty nights, 13 x 1018cm3 of water had fallen in the form of rain?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to know the surface area of the planet. It is approximately 510,067,000 km2. This corresponds to approximately 51 x 1017 cm2. If we imagine that the surface of the earth is completely smooth and that the oceans, seas, rivers, and streams are at the same level as the earth, then the water would reach a height that is provided by a simple equation, namely: \n\nV = A x h where V is volume, A is area and h is height. To obtain the height, the equation is as follows: h = V/A\n\nBy substituting V with the volume of existent water in the atmosphere and A with the surface area of the planet, we have: \n\nh = 13 x 1018cm3/51 x 1017 cm2 = 2.55 cm\n\nTherefore, if all of the existent water in the atmosphere were to fall upon the earth, independent of the amount of time it rained, the maximum height attained would be 2.55 centimeters, according to available data. We have now offered the first disagreement between the Bible and our current knowledge with respect to the deluge."

"3","bulking up.?","what is the best way to bulk up muscle in the fastest time? work out techniques and/or products that work?","Bo-flex and other workout machines are inferior to free weights.  Using free weights forces you to work both the target muscles and the muscles that stabilize them.  If you want to get big stick with the basics, using compound exercise such as squatting, dead-lifts, bench, rows, etc.  They work large groups of muscles together and stimulate a greater anabolic response.\n\nAlso, you can't turn fat into muscle.  It's not possible.  Through diet and exercise you can lose fat and gain muscle, giving the appearance of turning fat into muscle, but muscle is built from protein, not fat.\n\nWhat you really want to do to bulk is eat a lot and work out during the same period of time.  You want to make sure that your body always has plenty of protein and other nutrients necessary to grow muscle while you are working out.  A side effect will be that you will gain a little fat from the amount you are eating, but you by no means want to gain fat first and then start working out."

The gain in mass of the absorbing compound will be due to he water in the expired air."

"1","What do you think we learned from the late 60's, if anything? Your answer cann't be 'nothin', or 'GO LSD!'","I just saw a movie/documentary called The Drug Years... It was the second of four movies with this title, showing the late 60's and the impact drugs had on them. Let me say, for the majority of the time, I had this feeling of hope circulating through my chest, because I believe the hippies and the musicians had the right idea. I'm not saying lets all go out and get stoned on LSD, but they were using it to uplift their minds, think outside the box, and LOVE LOVE LOVE all, aside from prejudice, hate, and war... up until Manson used LSD to hack into the ugliness inside of him and went on his sordid killing spree, and Janis, Jim and Hendrix all died at 26, and the pigs shot everyone; that's when the hope seemed to die inside of me... I think it's sad that it took drugs to show this side of ppl in such monolithic proportions, and even more dissapointing that the myopic government came out on-top. I think everyone should have a picture of a flower in the barrel of a gun though!!!","I think we learned a lot. I watched the program, too, and lived through the hippie scene, so I had a lot of feelings and thoughts.\n\nI think, in the end, what we learned is that we don't have to be cookie-cutter copies of the ""norm."" My parents (WWII era folks) honestly did not know that.\n\nBut we also learned that you can't really reject the society around you, because, face it, baby, you IS the society.\n\nAnd we learned that, while perhaps LSD and pot weren't as bad as our parents thought they were, the cows don't get milked when everybody is too stoned to milk 'em.\n\nOh, yeah, we learned to question authority. That's a real good lesson, and one we need to hold on to.\n\n""Free love,"" well, that seemed kinda neat at the time, but it loses its patina when you keep waking up in strange places with strangers. And then there's HIV, of course, and that sure ain't groovy.\n\nHippies were young people, as a rule. And young people are idealistic, as another rule. That's how it should be. But getting older teaches you that throwing out ALL of the old ideas isn't necessarily the best course of action.\n\nWe learned that not all drugs are good, not all people trustworthy, not all ideals worth dying for, and not all revolutions bad. (Or good!)\n\nAll in all, it was an amazing time. Since I couldn't have gotten here without coming from there, I don't know what I'd have been like in a different time, but I think I'm glad I was there."

I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines- about their patient stories.\nThey arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low cost, as dental and eye surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings.

This is why I wonder about the role of the X sex chromosome in female sexual phenotype/development.","It is slightly more complicated. Prenatally a baby has what are called ovatesties. These will either become ovaries or testicles. On the Y chromosome is a gene (SRY) sex determining region of Y chromosome. It can get put on an X if a mutation occurs. Anyway sometime during development the SRY gene get turned on. This produces testosterone will cause the rest of he sexual organs to develop. \nThe X chromosome contains many genes that can produce different affect in different cells. Only one is need (the other is a Barr body) and the other has many functions in the cell. If you look at a calico cat for instance this will show you the best example. A calico being female has too X chromosomes. In some cells the maternal X is active and in others the paternal X. This shows up in the coat pattern."

Will they appear bigger? \n\nAlso, I heard that in winter time your body naturally stores some fat, is that true?\n\nI also heard that when you are stressed your body releases something makeing you gain a little weight or fat...true?","Yes. Muscle weighs more than fat, so 5 pounds of muscle will be much more compact than 5 pounds of fat. \n\nYes your body does store some fat in the winter, generally you are less active and tend to eat more ""comfort foods"", plus the holidays make it easy to gain weight while losing muscle.\n\nWhen you are stressed, your body makes cortisol, which causes you to gain weight around the middle. The best antidote to this is 1) drink plenty of water to flush these toxins out of your body. 2)Eat lots of fresh fruits and veggies in order to get the fiber and phytonutrients your body needs to stay regular, thus flushing toxins. and 3) Exercising regularly to relieve stress and promote strong lean muscles (muscles burn more calories even when you're resting, so keeping your muscles toned will help keep weight off.)"

Typically telescopes are able to perfectly focus only 1 color, and the other colors are very close, but not perfect.

"2","4 Questions on the intervals between squares of integers?","(1) Two numbers differ by 2 and their squares differ by 1,024. What are the numbers?\n\n(2) Two numbers differ by 4 and their squares differ by 1,024. What are the numbers?\n\n(3) Two numbers differ by 8 and their squares differ by 1,024. What are the numbers?\n\n(4) Two numbers differ by 16 and their squares differ by 1,024. What are the numbers?","Let's take the nos. to be 'x' and 'y'. For all 4 cases the difference of their squares is 1024. Therefore, \nx^2-y^2=1024 \n\nor, simplifying further we get\n(x-y)*(x+y)=1024\n\nwhich is constant for all cases. Lets investigate case by case:\n\n\nCase(1): Difference between the numbers is 2.\n\nThis means (x-y)=2\nsubstituing in our main equation, we get:\n2*(x+y)=1024\n(x+y)=512\n\nNow we arrive at two simple linear equations:\n(x+y)=512\n(x-y)=2\n\nsolve for 'x' and 'y' from the above eqns to get:\nx=257, y=255\n\nThese are our numbers for case(1)\n\n\nCase(2): Difference between the numbers is 4.\n\nSame as above method, only that (x-y)=4. Solving for x,y we get:\n\nx=130, y=126\n\n\nCase(3): Difference is 8\n\nSolution: x=68, y=60\n\n\nCase(4): Difference is 16\n\nSolution: x=40, y=24"

"1","persecuted christians?","i'm so tired of the christian questions that cry out that they are being persecuted. now i'm not talking about all christians here, but we all have seen our fair share of questions like these.\nwhat i want to say is that christians have no idea what persecution is. not unless you are jewish or any type of minority do you have the right to say that you are actively being hunted down for your beliefs. i mean, when was the last time genocide was an actual and pratical threat to christians, the ancient roman empire?! and please do not say anything about fundamentalist muslim extremist. they don't hate us for being christian; they hate us for being gluttonous, wasteful, and so much better off than vast majority. besides, can you really say that you are scared of them? if so, you're a p*ssy and i hate you too.\nit is so ironic that the most historically belligerent prosecutors complain of prosecution. i know that most christians are intelligent enough to not use this lame argument\ncontinued","I really like your questions you get right to the point yeah the only time Christians were persecuted was back in the Roman Empire. Ceasar was the first emperor to kill Christians and then Nero who killed Peter and Paul and set Christians on fire as torches to make light for his chariot races on Vatican Hill. That's basically the only time. In some countries now you have some killings but not major ones. The Jewish people went through a hell of a lot more. Especially with Hitler. I don't know why people whine so much. Everyone believes in something different deal with it you know. Just because you don't think it's right doesn't make it wrong. To them your religion may seem weird. I have studied all the major religions and find them quit interesting. I can see the point that they are coming across with. I think the people who want to be ignorant should go do some research before they open their mouths. GOOD POINT!!!!!you made.\n\n\n\nand Genesis...i think you are the one who has to do some research. I don't know where you got your ideas from but they are not right. Other religions do not kill you for caring around the bible, a few countries do but thats not persecution. Muslims kill other Muslims for converting Christianity. Muslims don't like Christianity for the fact they think the trinity refers to three different people.. they are monotheistic. They don't kill us for caring the bible. As a matter of fact your not even allowed in Mecca, their holy city without being Muslim. DO SOME RESEARCH GESH!!!!!! And Jewish people do not believe in Jesus, they just think he was a jewish guy. And they weren't killed because they believed in the true god. Hitler just didn't like them.\n\n\nFirst of all just because a couple of thousand Christians are killed in other countries doesn't make it persecution we kill thousands of people of different religions with hate groups that are supposedly Christians and they don't call it persecution they call it justification. Now 6 million Jews being killed I classify as persecution. Grow up people\n\nSanta Claus was based on a real person St. Nicholas he had lots of money and used to go around at night and throw money into the houses of poor people.

But, like someone already stated, they believe that we were all brothers in sisters in the ""Spirit World"" (where our souls lived before getting a physical body here on earth).\n\nThey believe that there was a council in the Spirit World, where God (""Heavenly Father""), wanted to conceive a plan for humans to be able to return back to Him.\n\nAccording to Mormon belief, Satan's idea was to make everyone faithful to God and to not give free will to humans.\n\nHowever, Jesus' idea was to give humans the ability to choose with their hearts who to follow.  It basically was the concept that being worshiped by choice is much more rewarding than being worshiped by force or not having any other option.\n\nMormons believe there was a ""war in heaven"" between Jesus and Satan.  God chose Jesus' idea, which made Satan rebel.  While Jesus was made ""Savior,"" Satan was thrown out of heaven.  With him went 1/3 of the spirits - those who chose to rebel, as well."

"1","Do you think all ""creation"" could have been made to be better than this?","If you think there couldn't be a better way then, are you saying everything is perfect?","If you are trying to get at ""Why are there disasters?"" or ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"", then here is my response.\n\nGod loves each one of us (even those of us who don't accept His sacrifice, Jesus) and because this love is just so huge, He is fair.  He doesn't force anyone to love Him.  He lets us choose.  So, why did the sweet lady get her purse stolen?  Because that robber has the same choice that we all make: do we follow what God has told us in His instructions to us (the Bible), have we listened to Jesus and allowed Him to pay for our sins, and have we daily allowed the Holy Spirit to rule our lives?  \n\nSo because we all (even dedicated, born-again Christians) make mistakes, and fall away from God and His word, WE are choosing to live for Him or against Him.  God did make everything perfect- He said that it was after every day- even the sixth day when He made man.  \n\nTo put this all in perspective, though, this life is just a moment in time compared to eternity with Christ.  When we have a bummer week in this life, it seems to last for so long, but 10 years later, we only remember a bit of it.  Same is true when we will be praising God or be banished from His presence for eternity.  Then that will be perfect.  For always.  No more tears.  I have already been praying for you."

I do not believe cloning is necessary to get stem cells to carry out genetic engineering.  THere are sources in the body to retrieve stem cells.  The problem is obtaining cells that have not specialized.  The less specialized the easier to make the cell transform into a specific cell for tissue growth.  Also, all cells contian the same copy of DNA.  I think it is only a matter of time before engineeris can stimulate a cell into changing into another cell.

The material should not be pulled too tightly. Start pouring water from the other beaker into the first through the layer of material as quickly as possibly but without spilling any water. Use the stopwatch to see how long it takes to transfer equal amounts of water. Relative permeability will be inversely proportional to the times. Water will not permeate latex rubber, if you try pouring it it will simply pool, giving infinite time and zero permeability. Pouring through the clothes the water will pool a little but still pass through, giving shorter times and higher permeabilities."

"1","R those crazy stories in the bible supposed to have happened?","all those fairytale types of stories is what im talking about. some say they are others say they arent.","The answer depends on which stories and the context in which you are asking.  Much of the Bible relates true history and has been documented by archealogical study.  Some Bible stories are exactly that, stories.  This doesn't mean they are not true in the theological sense.  They are stories told to relate a truth about God and his relationship with people.  Its like telling a story to illustrate a point.  The story may not be true, but the point the teller is making is true.  The key is to know what kind of story you are reading.  There are histories.  There is poetry.  There are songs.  There are philosophical dissertations.  Many forms of literature appear in the Bible.  When reading remember what the Bible is for.  God is trying to help us to know who he is and how he wants us to be.  If we read looking for the answer to these questions, ""Who is God?"" and ""Who are God's people?"" we will find that the answers found in the Bible are always true."

The Earth is pulled by the Moon's gravity just as the Moon is pulled by the Earth's gravity.  The center of gravity of the Earth-Moon system (called the barycenter) is actually inside the Earth, but not at the center of the Earth, so its better to say that the Earth wobbles rather than revolving around a point.\n\nPluto and Charon actually do revolve around each other, and around the barycenter which is between the two objects."

"2","How do I get nascent hydrogen using common materials in my backyard?","","I doubt you'll find it in your backyard.  Your best chances of getting hydrogen is electrolysis of water (pass a current through water and O2 will form at one end and H2 will form at the other--this is EXTREMELY dangerous, and should only be attempted with a battery so you don;t have live ends) or have zinc react with acid.  If you take a pennymade after about 1980, the entire interior is zinc, and it's very reactive--copper is just the coat.  If you scratch off the copper coat a bit to expose the zinc, and drop the penny in acid, it will react, creating bubbles of H2.  I don't know how you'd capture the bubbles, though.\n\nEdit: this is my 1,000th answer!  Hurrah!"

This implies that to calculate ln(y) for a given y>0, you can use finite approximations to the integral:\n\nintegral form 1 to y of 1/x = ln(y)\n\na very simple approximation is the following: for a given integer (big!) k of your choice, \n\nln(y) = sum for i=0 to k-1 of k/(k-i(y-1))\n\nHope this helps"
"1","What is Ramadan?","","Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim calendar. It is during this month that Muslims observe the Fast of Ramadan. Lasting for the entire month, Muslims fast during the daylight hours and in the evening eat small meals and visit with friends and family. It is a time of worship and contemplation. A time to strengthen family and community ties.\n\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Islam uses a lunar calendar—that is, each month begins with the sighting of the new moon. Because the lunar calendar is about 11 days shorter than the solar calendar used elsewhere, Islamic holidays ""move"" each year. In 2006 Ramadan will begin on Sept. 24.\n\nFor more than a billion Muslims around the world—including some 8 million in North America—Ramadan is a ""month of blessing"" marked by prayer, fasting, and charity. This year Ramadan precedes Christmas and Hanukkah. But while in many places these holidays have become widely commercialized, Ramadan retains its focus on self-sacrifice and devotion to Allah (God).\n\nWhy this Month?\n\n\nMuslims believe that during the month of Ramadan, Allah revealed the first verses of the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam. Around 610 A.D., a caravan trader named Muhammad took to wandering the desert near Mecca (in today's Saudi Arabia) while thinking about his faith. One night a voice called to him from the night sky. It was the angel Gabriel, who told Muhammad he had been chosen to receive the word of Allah. In the days that followed, Muhammad found himself speaking the verses that would be transcribed as the Qur'an. \n\nAt many mosques during Ramadan, about one thirtieth of the Qur'an is recited each night in prayers known as tarawih. In this way, by the end of the month the complete scripture will have been recited. \n\nFasting\n\n\nMuslims practice sawm, or fasting, for the entire month of Ramadan. This means that they may eat or drink nothing, including water, while the sun shines. Fasting is one of the Five Pillars (duties) of Islam. As with other Islamic duties, all able Muslims take part in sawm from about age twelve. \n\nDuring Ramadan in the Muslim world, most restaurants are closed during the daylight hours. Families get up early for suhoor, a meal eaten before the sun rises. After the sun sets, the fast is broken with a meal known as iftar. Iftar usually begins with dates and sweet drinks that provide a quick energy boost. \n\nFasting serves many purposes. While they are hungry and thirsty, Muslims are reminded of the suffering of the poor. Fasting is also an opportunity to practice self-control and to cleanse the body and mind. And in this most sacred month, fasting helps Muslims feel the peace that comes from spiritual devotion as well as kinship with fellow believers. \n\nEid al-Fitr\n\n\nRamadan ends with the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which in 2006 occurs on Oct. 24. Literally the ""Festival of Breaking the Fast,"" Eid al-Fitr is one of the two most important Islamic celebrations (the other occurs after the Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca). At Eid al-Fitr people dress in their finest clothes, adorn their homes with lights and decorations, give treats to children, and enjoy visits with friends and family. \n\nA sense of generosity and gratitude colors these festivities. Although charity and good deeds are always important in Islam, they have special significance at the end of Ramadan. As the month draws to a close, Muslims are obligated to share their blessings by feeding the poor and making contributions to mosques."

A perennial best seller, the book has been in continuous publication since it first appeared and has been translated into 18 languages. It is widely regarded as a modern spiritual classic.\n\nIn 1920, Yogananda was invited to serve as India's delegate to an international congress of religious leaders convening in Boston. His address to the congress, on ""The Science of Religion,"" was enthusiastically received. That same year he founded Self-Realization Fellowship to disseminate worldwide his teachings on India's ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its time-honored tradition of meditation.\n\nFor the next several years, he lectured and taught on the East coast and in 1924 embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. The following year, he established in Los Angeles an international headquarters for Self-Realization Fellowship, which became the spiritual and administrative heart of his growing work.\n\nThere is a course you can take to learn his meditation techniques.

The problem with ""The Purpose Driven Life"" and its ilk (and by the way, do you know *anyone* who has truly changed her/his life six months after reading this book?

This is a common misconception perpetrated by those wonderful PSAs with David Schwimmer and the likes.\n\nWhen scientists came out with research saying that you only use 20% of their brain, they meant that you only use 10-20% of your brain at any given time.\n\nSomehow, the media grabbed ahold of this and misinterpreted it to mean that you only use 20% of your brain in your lifetime.\n\nHere's how it actually works.  Throughout the course of a given day, you will use 100% of your brain.  Only about 15% or so is electrically active at any given point in time (for the average person).  Certain portions of your brain are active during certain activities, whether it be reading or riding a bike or anything else.\n\nThe magnificent thing about the brain is its efficiency.  If you do not use a set of neurons in the brain, they will disconnect from their neighboring neurons and sometimes die by apoptosis (mostly in development, but this occurs throughout life).  When a neuron pulls away from other neurons, more will extend to make new connections.  This way, the brain is constantly keeping otherwise unused portions used.\n\nSo to answer your question, you are already using 100% of your brain!  The real question here is: how do I use my brain's potential more effectively?\n\nWell, keep healthy, physically and mentally.  Exercise to keep your blood flowing to your brain, feeding it.  Drink water to help this process.  Do mentally stimulating activities: read books, write, paint, think of things!  Meditate!  Train your ability to focus on one thing at a time.  Train your ability to multitask.  Turn off the TV.  Go outside and enjoy nature.  Relax.  Help kids with their homework.  Study something.\n\n~The more you know\n\nlol"

"2","How much do they really pay a doctor?","","Well my mother is a phsycian. It really depends on a wide range of things. If you have your own practice, work for someone else, or a mix of both. It also depends on their speciality and level of skill. Physicians with a few years of experience can expect to start out at around $150,000 per year. The more specialized the doctor is the more money they make. Another large factor is location. In private practice it depends on how large the practice is and how many patients are seen and can be significantly more than the 150K. Doctors earn their money though. They work long hours, work hard, and put up with a lot of stress. Who would want to have to worry about saving lives every day. With a person's life on your shoulders, this causes a huge amount of stress."

"2","about metal detectors?","how is the effect(result)for working with a metal detector in winter,when the ground is wet???\nwhat about summer???\nwhich one gives more better result????","I think that metal detectors just work by setting up a magnetic field. When the apparatus move over a location that has a magnetic material a flux is produced that induces an electric current in the metal detector, activating a sensor.\n\nIf this is the case (i'm 95% sure it is), then the only factors affecting it's quaility would be within the machine itself as far the smallest current that activates the sensor.\n\nHeat and moisture would not change the magnetic field (moisture might theoretically alter the detectors magnetic field a little bit, but certainly not enough to measure). The both give the same result."

I have tried using lube, more foreplay and even different postions but that has not work. I even want to the doctor to get check out too see if there was sometime wrong, i have been check for every disease know to men. every test came back negative. i have even told my doctor and she says there is nothing wrong. . I feels like a burning stinging sensation outside the hole and alittle bit inside. It's making me not want to have sex anymore. What should i do","You know, I've been having basically the same problem for almost two years. Mine is caused by tearing off the top two layers of skin because my boyfriend went gung-ho before I was ready. I've even tried not having sex for six weeks and it didn't stop hurting.\n\nThe only thing that helps me is making sure we have tons of lube (he will generally give me oral sex first so I am ready) and only having sex every few days. It sucks, but it saves the skin.\n\nIs there a chance you have torn the flap of skin right outside the hole? I've done that too (and not in childbirth either!). It sucks and it's very painful during sex, especially with artifical lube.\n\nGood Luck."
"2","What do you think would be the opinion of Mary Shelley (author Frankenstein) in regard to Genetic Engineering?","Explain the relation of genetic engineering to Frankenstein. Would Mary Shelley have used this technology instead of electricity to create her monster? What would Shelley's opinion of this technology be? What would Shelley think of our technology today?","Well, first of all, if genetic engineering had been popular at the time, she would probably have used it in her book, somehow.  HOW Frankenstien's monster is created is not the point, it's the consequences that the book explores.\nShelley would probably see genetic engineering as equivalent to other medical and bio-technology.  No better, no worse.  Frankenstien would still be relevant, as a warning about creating things we can't control.  However, I think she would be encouraged by the fact that many scientists have read, or are at least familiar with, Frankenstien.  In this she succeeded in warning us about the product of our technology."

Educated out is another way of looking at it. Many professional psychics have grown up in a psychic friendly environment. Perhaps a grand-parent or parent with the knowledge has helped bring the extra sense out in the open and encouraged its use. But there are as many practicing psychics who have not had the benefit of caring psychic guidance and who have still managed to develop and hone this natural extra sense.

So I think if I continue doing what I've BEEN doing, then I automatically forfeit my right to complain if it continues to suck.  \n\nAnyone else?\nFeel free to include any good examples.","Wow that's an incredible question...I'll do my best to give an incredible answer.\n\nFirst..YOU DON'T SUCK! And only your thought of you do, you need to give yourself room to be human.. we all make mistakes, sometimes more than once or twice or even a dozen times before we start beating ourselves up enough to say.. ""Well this isn't working, time to change tactics""\n\nDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is the definition of insanity!! \n\nComplaining however is whole different thing in itself..Is it really that you're complaining about it... or needing feedback from an outsider's view to see if your decisions are with sound reason..and as long as you're looking for more info on what went wrong..and learning from them.. \n\nGiving up that right to complain happens when you aren't at all conscience that you have any responsibility in what has happened .... blaming circumstances, blaming others, blaming anything else but what you've personally contributed that made this outcome a reality is what voids the complaint department to me.  And it's okay to complain about yourself, as long as you're learning what you did doesn't work, and try a new path next time, and if the same result happen again.. and you complain.. to me that means you're looking for someone else's view to help see what you might have missed in the situation.\n\nGood Example?..Well I am a work-a-holic, and help-a-holic, When I have time I give it.. and where I see troubles I try to help with it. My hubby's granny had many troubles with credit cards, bills, health and a live in son that most of the time wasn't employed..So I took every path imaginable to bring back value and calmness to her life, but you can't help those who won't help themselves.. so as much as I tried to help in different venues, it was fruitless...you can't invite a person to live with you to help them, for them to want to bring the problem with them to you. And I don't hear them complain anymore since my hubby and I have made several offers to help, and they don't accept those terms, it's the only terms we are able to give. So you make peace with that, wish them well, and pray for them. Then you move forward."

Secondly Judas describes Jesus in his Childhood, saying Jesus would kill another child if he angered him and would mould a pigion of clay an make it live. What are your thoughts? Heidi","Its a lot like anything else. You either have faith in it or you don't.  They did prove its authenticity.  They know it was around at 180Ce.  And they do have a point (those that have answered) that they cannot prove that what the contents say is fact. (meaning this is actually what was said and all that) However if you want to take that route we can say the same for the other Gospels. Those in the bible and those not.  The Gospels in the bible are just as old.  We were not there.  We take what the scriptures say on faith. (for those who believe) So this book is no different.)  I personally feel that this Gospel has a lot to offer in our understanding of Jesus and his Disciples.  Just as the Nag Hammadi Library and the Dead Sea Scrolls.  They give us more insight. More understanding.  And, I feel, They give us something to weigh against the Gospels and other books in the New Testiment."

Wouldn't you think they would question why the elder who convinces them to do it hasn't done it himself? Would be my first question","First of all, I think there are a lot of misconceptions about suicide bombings in the Muslim world. In Islam, if you commit suicide, then in the hereafter you are doomed to go through that death over and over again in whatever way you killed yourself. It is a major sin. \n\nHowever, the people who are doing suicide bombings are people living in desperate situations that you will probably never be able to understand. But let's just try to imagine that you are, say, a Palestinian whose house has just been torn down to make way for an Israeli settlement while your family was still inside and your little brother just died of appendicitis because the Israeli army wouldn't let the ambulance pass the checkpoint to get to the hospital. Or imagine that you live in Haditha, Iraq, and no one can go outside because the US army forces that came to save you from Saddam are having daily firefights outside your door with rebel leaders, and then one day one of their tanks gets hit and they get so mad that they storm your house and shoot everyone inside... mom, dad, babies, kids, grandparents... and then they go on to your neighbor's house and do the same. Or imagine that you live in Afghanistan where the Taliban have been pushed out of power, but that has left no real government in control and so your mom and your sisters can't leave the house because if any men find them on the streets they are likely to be raped and killed. These are real scenes from the daily life of thousands of people.\n\nNow...imagine that some other nation or group managed to destroy our central government and take over our country. Imagine that you lived every day in fear of those people, knowing that they suspect you of being up to no good just because you live here, watching them patrol your neighborhood streets with guns and tanks, seeing them try to question people who get scared and run and then are shot down in cold blood. Imagine that the idea of safety and comfort and home and family has been destroyed and replaced by fear and paranoia, by hunger and poverty and disease. Imagine after days and then weeks and then months and then years of this how desperate you would begin to feel. And yet, if you try to speak out against what is happening, then the world media labels you as an ""insurgent,"" and ""extremist,"" and a ""terrorist."" Imagine how your sense of patriotism and the need to protect to your family would drive you to take action... some action... any action.\n\nSo to answer your one-sided, uneducated question- it isn't so much a matter of old guys brainwashing young guys into comitting suicide, as much as entire societies that are in terrible situations and young kids who still have enough hope left that they can make a difference that they go out and do something desperate."

You really have put some thought into them.\nI also have a feeling that you know the answers to your own questions and ask them just to get people to think.\n\nI believe whole heartedly that some mental illnesses are spiritual conditions.  Have you ever wondered why more and more people are diagnosed with depression, ADD, bi polar, and other illnesses every year?\nI think it is a direct relation to the way God's influence is consistently less every year on society.  People are rejecting His laws and ways more aggressively and openly every year.\nIt's not that these people don't have the symptoms, but it is being misunderstood.\n\nNow, I do believe that some of these people really need medical help.  But many of them are in a bad spiritual state.  They lacked discipline as a child, they lacked good family upbringings, values, teachings, etc.  It all starts in the home.  And it will continue to get worse because the home is becoming more lost and wicked every year.\n\nThen you also have your bonafide posessions.  Remember that in the bible, Jesus rebuked many demons out of people who were lunatick.\nToday, those people are getting doped up instead of the demons cast out of them.  Their bodies are calm because of the drugs, but they are a spiritual mess inside.\n\nIf you look with the Spirit, you will know that some people that you meet are posessed.  I have met a few myself and have had confrontations with them spiritually.  It's not fun, let me tell you.\n\nI think the state of this world is in a mental illness.  Their logic and reason is anything but logical or reasonable.  The way society views and handles issues today is sickening.  \n\nI could go on and on about this, but I think you get the point I'm trying to make.\n\nI can guarantee you that you will never find a true Christian in a mental ward because they are not able to be posessed.  Except for real medical problems like Alzheimers and such, a true Christian is protected from spiritual illness.\n\nAs far as the chemical condition of the brain for people who are mentally ill, you have a cause and effect issue or ""chicken and an egg problem"".\nDid the chemicals cause the condition or did the condition cause the chemicals?  No one knows or will be ever able to answer."

Ironically, these glittery gems are comprised from the element carbon and have the weakest type of chemical bonds, while polyyne has the strongest bonds in carbon chemistry. \n\nI wasn't able to find a comparison of polyyne and ADNR, but I believe ADNR was developed first and held the title until polyyne was developed a short time later.

The First Thing You have to do is to Admit that You Enjoy Smoking! Cigarettes Taste so Damn Good! I Quit almost 17 Years ago, and I Want One Right Now! I often Wondered why they Taste so Good,if it was because of the Tobacco Itself, or the way Cigarettes are made. Now, I Know Why. It's Both! When most Tobacco is Grown,it's loaded with Fertilizer, and Chemicals to make it as Potent as Possible.Then, when Cigarettes are Made-Up at the Factory, They're loaded up with even more Chemicals. That's why when You Light up a Cigarette, and put it in an Ashtray, it will Burn to the End all by Itself!Chemicals! That's what You're Addicted to, not Tobacco!Even Now,after almost 17 Years, if I'm next to Someone with a Good, Strong Winston, or Marlboro lit up, I'll Catch Myself taking a ""Whiff""! To This Day, I tell Everyone that I fully Intend to Resume Smoking when it becomes Apparent that WW III has begun, and the World is coming to an End!

It's all available, but it'll be about $5.00 per Pack, and a lot of Hassle. But, by cutting down on the Tar, Nicotine, and Chemicals, it'll be a whole lot Easier to Quit!

"2","How does human's eyes work?","","Basically, light passes through the front of the eye, the pupil, and the crystalline lens.  It hits the retina (the back of the eye), which has special cells that transform the light energy into a signal that the brain can understand.  The brain then interprets the image.  Of course, there are many other things that come into play, like how the eyes work together and how strong the eyes are."
"3","Seriously...which is really better???","Walking or running?  10 points to the person who can give me a really good answer (none of this bad for knees and stuff...im looking for something deeper)","Best for burning calories and losing weight?  Neither actually.  Interval training is best for that b/c it takes advantage of both aerobic and anaerobic activities.  Running second.  Walking third.  Short, high-intensity exercise will burn the most calories.  \n\nInterval training will actually train your body to burn calories through-out the day.  Not just while you're working out.  Interval training is an intense work-out of 15 to 30 minutes where you begin at a base rate and then gradually build up the intensity at intervals and then bring it back down.  Here's an example...Let's say you were running on a treadmill for 24 minutes.  The first two minutes you'd start out at your base rate:  For our example, let's say you start out at speed 5.  After two minutes, go up to 5.5 for two minutes.  Then, go back down to speed 5 for two more minutes.  Then up to 6 for two minutes, and again back down to 5.  After you hit 6.5, you'd then start dropping your pace again.  Go back to 6, then 5.5, and finally 5 again.

"2","Why do penises grow?","Is it the hormones or what?  I need to know for a biology exam.","Penises grow from miniature in fetus to infant size to child size to adult size in males as a result of normal growth in size by cell number increases, esp during puberty due to dramatic increases in testoserone. Erect penises make penetration easier.\n\nPlease clarify ""grow"" or become ""erect-engorged"" \n\nEnlargement due to erections can occur at any stage of life from fetus stage on, including during the normal sleep cycle of any aged male (once every 60-90 minutes during sleep) regardless of sexual response, but is most easily-likely to engorge from puberty stages on through middle age during arousal phase of sexual response cycle. Erections are physiologically a sign of RELAXATION (blood flows in), and the beginning of arousal stage. Frequency and firmness of erections (and perceived NEED for sex) may or may not diminish from middle age on, depending on numerous factors. But testosterone assists with the frequency, duration and ease of erections.  Teens and 20s are the ages of highest testosterone, thus the ease-frequency-firmness of erections. \n\nPenises can also engorge-become erect rather ""spontaneously"" due to puberty surges of testosterone. Most males also notice erections in the morning as well.\n\nIf females take masculinizing hormones, within six months their clitoris may be as large as a human thumb."

"3","What is the safest way to quit smoking for someone with current risk of strokes ?","I have been a smoker for 25 yrs, and have a history of severe neurological sarcoidosis.","The Allen Carr Method\nHOW THE METHOD WORKS\n\nUsing psychotherapy, the method works in the opposite way to the “willpower” method. It does not concentrate on the reasons the smoker should not smoke : the money, the slavery, the health risks and the stigma. Smokers know all that already. Instead it focuses on why smokers continue to smoke in spite of the obvious disadvantages.\n\nIt is fear that keeps smokers hooked!\n\nFear the smoker will have to give up their pleasure or crutch. Fear the smoker will be unable to enjoy life or handle stress. Fear the smoker will have to go through an awful trauma to get free. Fear the smoker will never get completely free from the craving.\n\nThe Method removes these fears \nSmokers quit with the Allen Carr Method as happy non-smokers, not feeling deprived but with a huge sense of relief and elation that they have finally achieved what they always wanted….\n\nTO BE FREE!\n\nWhat about the terrible withdrawal pangs from nicotine?\n\nThe physical withdrawal from nicotine is so slight that most smokers don’t realise that they are addicts. What smokers suffer when they try and quit using other methods is the misery and depression caused by the belief that they are being deprived of a pleasure or a crutch.\n\nThe Allen Carr Method removes this feeling of deprivation. \nIt removes the need and desire to smoke. Once the smoker is in the right frame of mind and they follow the simple instructions, the physical withdrawal from nicotine is hardly noticeable.\n\nNo Gimmicks!\n\nThe Method does not use any gimmicks, useless aids or substitutes. No nicotine gum, patches, lozenges, tabs, inhilators or nasal sprays! No needles! No lasers! No drugs! No herbs! No shock treatment! \n\nThe Allen Carr Method is successful because:\n\nIt removes the smokers’ conflict of will. \nThere are no bad withdrawal pangs. \nIt is instantaneous and easy. \nIt is equally effective for long-term heavy smokers and light smokers. \nYou need not gain weight. \nYou will not miss smoking. \n\n\nMedical Endorsements\nA personal view from Professor Judith Mackay MBE, JP, FRCO (Edin), FRCP (Lon), World Health Organisation Advisory Panel on Tobacco and Health\n\n“I have no hesitation in supporting Allen Carr’s work. Many clinics use some of his techniques but it would appear that few do it in quite such a successful package.” \n\nCarole Johnson, Coronary Heart Disease Prevention Unit, Tyne Tees \n\n“his success rate was such that, when budgets allow, we continue to use Easyway for work with specific groups and individuals.”\n\nDr Anil Visa BSc, MBBch., FRCA, Consultant – Royal Hospitals NHS Trust – Royal London Hospital\n\n“I have observed the Allen Carr method at first hand and have found it to be very successful and I wholeheartedly support it as an effective way to quit smoking.”\n\nDr William Green, Head of Psychiatric Dept, Matilda Hospital, Hong Kong\n\n“It is a remarkable fact that Allen Carr, on his own admission a non-professional in behaviour modification, should have succeeded where countless psychologists and psychiatrists holding postgraduate qualifications have failed, in formulating a simple and effective way to stop smoking.”\n\nDr Martin Jarvis, Principle Scientist, Imperial Cancer Research \nFund and Reader in Health Psychology, University College London\n\n”...I am more than happy to testify to Allen Carr’s enduring involvement and to recognise the value of the kind of behavioural and cognitive support he provides.”\n\nDr PM Bray MB CH.b., MRCGP\n\n“I was really impressed by the method. In spite of the Allen Carr organisation’s success and fame, there were no gimmicks and the professional approach was something a GP could readily respect. I would be happy to give a medical endorsement of the method to anyone.” \n\nCelebrity Endorsements\n\n""His method is absolutely unique, removing the dependence on cigarettes, while you are actually smoking.

"3","What is cholelithis?  And what do you do for it?","","colitis\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis\nColitis\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nColitis is a digestive disease characterized by inflammation of the colon.\nContents \n1 Signs and symptoms \n2 Types \n3 Treatment \n4 External links \nSigns and symptoms\nSigns and symptoms of colitis include pain, tenderness in the abdomen, fever, swelling of the colon tissue, bleeding, erythema (redness) of the surface of the colon, rectal bleeding, and ulcerations of the colon. Tests that show these signs are plain X-rays of the colon, testing the stool for blood and pus, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Additional tests include stool cultures and blood tests,and blood chemistry tests.\n\nTypes\nThere are several types of colitis, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's Disease, diversion colitis, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, and atypical colitis.\n\nA well known subtype of infectious colitis is pseudomembranous colitis, resulting from infection by a toxigenic strain of Clostridium difficile. Parasitic infections can also cause colitis.\n\nAny colitis which has a rapid downhill clinical course is known as fulminant colitis. In addition to the diarrhea, fever, and anemia seen in colitis, the patient has severe abdominal pain and a clinical picture similar to septicemia with shock is present. Approximately half of those patients require surgery.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome is a separate disease which has been called spastic colitis or spastic colon. This name causes confusion since colitis is not a feature of irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nAutistic enterocolitis is a disputed medical entity but refers to a type of colitis found in patients with autism.\nTreatment\nTreatment of colitis may include the administration of antibiotics and general anti-inflammatory medications such as Mesalamine or its derivatives; steroids, or one of a number of other drugs that ameliorate inflammation. Surgery is sometimes needed, especially in cases of fulminant colitis.\n\nSome have found a change in diet to be effective at treating the symptoms of colitis, especially reducing the intake of carbohydrates. This approach has been championed by Elaine Gottschall.\n\n\nI hope for two things: (1) you find this information useful and (2) you pay no attention to the comedian immediately below me. The guy below him is probably the correct answer here. You might want to google the word the way he spelled it."

Extra virgin olive oil is very good for your health and heart's health, but of course it is very high in calories as well. However, it isn't nearly as fattening as butter or other animal byproducts. Use it, don't abuse it. And don't expect to see any benefits if you just add olive oil to your diet, without making any changes to your previous eating habits.\n\nOlive oil is best eaten uncooked - as salad dressing for instance, and if you can substitute other oils you use in your food with olive oil, research shows you'll benefit from it. Even when cooked, olive oil is very reluctant, and maintains most of its beneficial properties to health. A Mediterranean diet in general, rich in olive oil, fruit, vegetables and fish - is considered among the best diets."

At times, the god may be assumed, so we have names that contain the phrase ""god is gracious"", or ""whom god loves"", but here the term god undoubtedly refers not to an abstract deity but rather to a specific, assumed deity which might be a local god, or the god to whom the parents prayed. Much of the time, the god was named.\n\nCommon words or phrases were often used in names. These included ankh (life), mery (beloved), hotep (peace), nefer (beautiful) and khenemet (one who is joined with) \n\nMany names could be used by both males and females, and in these instances, an identifier, such as a hieroglyphic man or woman, was appended to the name in order to make it masculine or feminine. However, ""et"" on the end of a name, or sometimes in the middle of it, appears to have been a feminine identifier, and ""pa-sheri"" (masculine) or ""ta-sherit"" (feminine) was somewhat similar to the equivalent of ""Junior"" today. We also find Si, meaning son, or Sit, meaning daughter."

"2","How can animals without teeth eat? What are other means of mechanical digestion for animals?","","Think of whales. They have that siv-like stuff that strains krill and plankton stuff out of the water, to be swallowed and digested later.\n\nOk, now for a smarter explination: \n\nWhen humans eat, there's a lot more methods and reasons behind digestion than simply mechanical breakdown.\nFood starts in the mouth, where salivary amylaze, an enyzme, begins to break down starch. The mechanical process increases the surface area of the food, allowing a more rapid breakdown. Peristalsis moves food along the digestive track, partially digesting and absorbing along the way. In the stomach, chemicals from the gallbladder and pancreas are secreted to further breakdown food (with stomach fluid, ""acid chyme""), and specifically protein (by enzyme ""pepsin,"" thus the antacid medicine). This is known as ""chemical digestion."" Stomach muscles also aid in mixing digestive enzymes; this is what happens when your stomach lurches, bubbles (but gas can cause this also), ""talks,"" or churns. Next, as food travels to the small and then large intestine, fat in food is absorbed in the small and water in the large.\n\nSpecies vary in the ammount of breakdown needed for their body to absorb nutrients. This describes the function of most. On the whole, animals besides humans use teeth to intimidate predators and capture prey. Some snakes swallow eggs whole, and would use teeth only to defend against the mother bird. The venus fly-trap captures flies and then disables them without teeth. Spiders don't have teeth, persay, but poisonous fangs which disable their prey--you may recall that they merely ""suck"" the liquids out of their food. \nAnimals equipped with other mechanisms besides teeth to capture prey have no need for them to digest."
"2","Two ways in which the sequences of your DNA might affect your phenotype?","Also, why don't the repetive sequences described in the article seem to affect the carrier's phenotype?","The reason repetitive sequences often do not affect the carrier's phenotype is because many repetitive sequences are in what we know as ""introns"" or unexpressed regions of DNA. While our DNA contains an enormous amount of data, often only a small sequence of nucleotides is necessary to make the proteins that produce a phenotype. These active sequences are in expressed portions of the DNA, or ""exons."" In addition, sometimes a single strand of DNA carries sequences for many different types of characteristics in an individual, but have different portions of the DNA expressed. Therefore, what may be an intron for, say, eye color, may be an exon for hair color."

Nuclear clearly has a part to play, as does wind, solar and other renewables.  Coal certainly isn't going away anytime soon either.  \nThere simply aren't enough resources to cost effectively build just one kind of power generation plant for all the world's needs.\nthe National Renewable Energy Laboratory has some great discussions about this if you're interested enough to find them."

"2","Can u science experts help me with this q?","If so, can u answer one of these two questions or both. First question is (Compare and contrast what happens to an animal, a plant, and a Paramecium cell in a hypotonic, an isotonic, or a hypertonic solution) and the second question is (Could Elodea or Paramecium from a freshwater lake be epected to survive if transplanted into the ocean? Explain.","ok, so generally speaking, in the hypotonic environment, a cell is swell up, and potentially burst. The way to remember this is that hypO (the letter O)tonic is the cell which is normally drawn as a more squarelike shape becomes circular as it takes on water. In an isotonic solution, the environment and the cell have equal solutes so no movement of water occurs. In a hypertonic solution (lots of particles in the environment) so the water leaves the cell and shrivels up. \nHowever, we also have to take into account the type of cell that we are placing into these environments. The above applies to animal cells and paramecium as they don't have rigid cell walls. However, plant cells do have cell walls so it does not apply to them. Plant cells have what we call turgor pressor, so they can withstand the environmental influences, or changes in tonicity, alot better. When the plant takes on water, it has the cell wall to prevent bursting. When the plant cell looses water, the cytoplasm shrinks while the cell wall keeps the cell's shape.\n\nQuestion 2:\nIf you were to place elodea or paramecium from fresh to salt water:\nwhen elodea is placed in salt water, we observe the process of plasmolysis - shrinkage of cell contents due to water loss.\nfor image see:\nhttp://images.apple.com/education/solutions/iwork/lessons/media/RealWorldScienceSample.pdf\n\nWith Paramecium: it has 2 contratile vacuoles that are used to balance salt concentration by expelling water"

The center of the Earth is very very very hot and a lot of substances (a lot of it being Iron (Fe) )are in molten form down there......Have you ever seen a volcano errupt (on a documentary or in a film?)? Well that stuff coming out is Molten Lava and is a mixture of substances (mostly rock) in liquid form. You cant get too close or you'll burn from the heat. I would go on telling you about this but then we'll be talking about another subject.\n\nThe gravitational pull of the Earth is because of its mass AND because of its rotation around the sun and itself. All bodies in the universe have a gravitational force and this force effects every other ""body"" in the universe (a bit like a draw in a tug-o-war) (This also explains why matter never can be completely annihilated and other aspects like the existence of dark matter and so forth....but that's advanced Astro-physics) \nThis gravitational pull is measured in NEWTONS (Newton is the guy that laid down the laws of gravity after an apple fell on his head.....) You'd weigh differently on each planet due to its MASS. For example if you where to lift a matchbox on Jupiter you would need a lot of help because it would weigh a lot more then it does here.....and so would you. So much so that your skeleton would not be able to support you and you would probably crumple into a meat heap......(i'm not going into detail because this will just go on and on to knew subjects.....you can find this info on the internet.....it's more fun to find out for yourself)\n\nI hope I've been helpful......."

"1","A Serious Question here. I am openning a kind of Debate.?","Why is it that on IM services, people from third world countries are ignored? All that they are trying to do is to make friends all over, but they are given poor response, sometimes even by looking at their country name. They are not even given a chance to prove if they are good or bad. In my personal opinion, they end up acting in a negative way, impersonating as someone they are not. This thing is resulting in increasing number of Liers on internet. Any ideas/opinions/sugessions as to why such classified treatment is given to third world people?","Well, I have some ideas as to why you perceive this to be the case, whether or not it is.  A great many people on the Internet (I do not have IM, so I'm speaking more generally) are using English as a second language.  If they take their time, really carefully compose their sentences, we wouldn't even know that they had not been using English for many years.  Their English teachers would be very proud of them.  But IM goes too fast for that; you have to be quick to keep up with the dialog.  So a non-native speaker who has not been using English very long will start to get incomprehensible.\n\nOf course, there is also some hostility and resentment on the part of some people toward what they feel is an ""invasion"" from ""foreigners.""  In any country with a good bit of socialism (housing, medical care, whatever), it is easy to feel that the newcomers are getting preferential treatment over the citizens.  I know this has happened a great deal in England, for example, and to a lesser but still noticeable degree in the US.  This builds up an attitude that anyone from a third world country who tries to learn English is trying to ""come over here and use up our scarce resources.""  It may or may not be true of a given person, and there's no reason to assume it is true, but the inflated bureaucracy that is in place to ""care for"" immigrants is horribly expensive, and breeds resentment."

"3","Anyone know of cheap health insurance for a college student?","","First, check out health plans available through your college. If that doesn’t work, several major insurance companies have developed plans aimed at the so-called “young invincible” market – people in the 20’s. That’s a good thing since about a third of all recent college graduates don’t have health insurance. Two of the most prominent plans are from Blue Cross Blue Shield and UniCare. The BCBS plan is called the “Tonik Health Plan” and was originally developed in California, but is expected to expand rapidly. It features low premiums ($70-$135) and high deductibles ($1,500-$5,000). Another plan for men and women in your age group is from UniCare. Again, it started in Texas but is supposed to branch out to other parts of the country. It’s called “Sound” and has features similar to the BCBS plan.\n\nDepending on your age, you might be able to get coverage under your parent’s plan. Many states have extended the age that children can be included under their parent’s insurance policy. \n\nYou might also want to look into short-term medical insurance.  Typically, they last from a month to six months, although you can find short-term policies that last for a year. Short-term doesn’t offer the same range of benefits as longer-term insurance, but it usually helps pay for:\n\n·	Hospital room and board\n·	Ambulatory services\n·	Intensive Care\n·	Lab Exams\n·	X-rays\n·	Prescription medications\n\nThe best way to get health insurance information, though is from a qualified health insurance agent. Check out MostChoice.com. It’s a Web site that offers free policy descriptions and prices from health plans across the country. You can also get in touch with local area agents who should be able to answer your questions. There’s no cost and you’re not obligated to buy anything from the insurance agents, and MostChoice won’t use your personal information for any reason apart from matching you with health plans and health insurance agents in your area.\n\nYou can visit MostChoice here: http://www.mostchoice.com/health-insurance.cfm\n\nHope this helps,\n\nBarnes @ MostChoice."

Also notice that if you add two numbers together then to find the remainder when divided by three you only need to add remainders. So for example13 can be written as 10 + 3.  Looking only at remainders this is 1+0 =1 so the remainder when 13 is divided by 3 is 1.  You can reduce a number by 30 without affecting the remainder so higher numbers such as 50 can be reduced by 30 without affecting the remainder.  So you can see how numbers below 100 can be checked this way.\n\nNext notice that a number whose leading digit is one followed by zeros must have remainder 1 when divided by 3.  Take one from this number to get a digit whose numbers are all 9 and this is obviously divisible by 3.  This fact allows us to extend the reasoning we went through for 10, 20 etc to all higher numbers.\n\nThis explanation may be a bit hard going but hopefully it will be some sort of inspiration for your understanding."

"2","What are the different branches of biology?","","""Branches of Biology\nBecause there is such a huge variety of living things on the earth, the science of biology has many different branches and areas of study. Depending on their discipline, biologists usually research one or more of the following categories: \n\nMicrobiology, a study dealing with the structure and existence of microorganisms, which are tiny life forms such as a bacteria or a virus; \nZoology, which is the study of animal life; \nBotany, which is focused on plant life; \nAnd physical anthropology, where scientists study human life, such as our existence and how we interact with other life forms. \nBiologists also use other sciences to research life. Without chemistry and physics, much of the knowledge we have gathered about life would have been impossible to collect. \n\nIn an effort to answer the “what is life” question, much of the history of biological study has been focused on trying to classify and define life forms. The four categories above led to the development of many subcategories as biologists learn more about the depth and complexity of living things. Some of the other subdivisions of biology are:- \n\nPhysiology\nStudy of the vital functions and basic activities of living organisms - cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems - and their parts, in relation to the whole. \nEmbryology\nStudy of the formation and development of organisms from the zygote, or fertilised egg. Confined mainly to multi-celled organisms. \nTaxonomy\nHierarchical classification of natural organisms indicative of their structures and differences. \nGenetics\nStudy of inheritance and variation in organisms, and mechanisms by which these operate; causes of similarities and differences among related individuals. \nEcology\nStudy of relationships between organisms and their environment; the interactions of individuals within groups and with their suroundings. \nMorphology\nThe study of the shapes of plants and animals. \nMolecular Biology\nStudy of chemical processes at the level of large organic molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. \nBiochemistry\nStudy of the chemical processes within living systems as a whole. \nMicrobiology\nThe study of micro-organisms - their structure, function, and significance."""

You can cut calories and perform crunches like crazy, try one of the hot new incredible infomercial ab devices and buy a “fat burner”, Also there is another  option but it is not too popular. Eat right, Understand functions of the abdominal muscles, work the body as a whole, and allow for ongoing fat release. Of all of two options, there is only one that ""works,"" all of the time. Unfortunately, it “appears” to be the most complicated. \n\nHere is the Real Ab-Solution:\n\nBefore we go any further, I would like to point out that slimming down your abdominal parts REALLY means reducing you body fat percentage in those areas. Therefore, the goal is to reduce your body fat percentage.  \n\nNow that we understand what we are seeking, let us zero in on the solution.\n\nStep 1: Eat right\n""Eat right"" sounds so simplistic, but the idea is maximize natural unprocessed foods and minimize processed or junk foods (Please do not go on a depravation diet, it will make things worse). However, you also need to eat in a way that supports Fat loss.\n\nThe real trick lies in stabilizing blood sugar, which allows fat to be released from your fat cells. You would do that by eating meals free from simple sugars and refined carbs, low in processed saturated fat, and balanced with protein, complex carbs, fiber, and essential fatty acids. \n\nStep 2: Move\nOnce the fat is release from the cells, they need to be burned in your muscle cells. Releasing the body fat is not enough; you need to support your nutrition with a more active lifestyle. If you are not active, the released fat just goes back to the fat cells and they are not burned. Burning that fat make your “six packs” visible. You not only need to work on your abs or core muscles but you also need to work you the body as a whole (focus on the major muscles like your legs and back).\n\nThen you need to optimize circulation with moderate aerobic exercise (do not go crazy), and fat release should be consistent and ongoing, and a little at a time, those abs will shine through.\n\nDO NOT continue doing something just because ""THEY"" say it's the way things should be done. Allow yourself to choose the solution that will work for you, regardless of what it may be. The only way for you to know who is right is to measure your progress and ACTUALLY track your results.\n\nCHANGE IS HARD, but it's also worth it. Not getting results makes change EXTREMELY HARD.\n\nGet support from friends, family or a coach. Losing weight is not as hard at it seems once you know what to do.

Such a track is also used to bring the Space Shuttle to its launching pad.\nIn the early days of railroads, much material for ballast came from rock found in the local area. In the Midwest, for example, much use was made of granite, while states in the southeast, such as Florida, made use of limestone. One specific type of granite used in the Midwest earned the name ""Pink Lady"" due to its color; in other areas, the ballast can be a mix of light and dark colors called ""Salt and Pepper""."
"2","Do centipedes really have 100 legs and millipedes 1,000?","","Some centipedes have hundred or more legs but no millipedes got a thousand.\n \nCentipedes (Class Chilopoda) are fast-moving venomous, predatory, terrestrial arthropods that have long bodies and many jointed legs. How many legs a centipede has depends on its species and age. Despite their name, which stems from the Latin words 'centum' (meaning 'hundred') and 'ped' (meaning 'foot'), thus mean ""hundred legged"" not many centipedes actually have as many as that number. Some have as few as 15 pairs, others have as many as 173 pairs, but most sorts have about 35 pairs. They normally have around half that number of legs, though it is possible to find centipedes with over 200 legs. Centipedes are highly segmented but with only one pair of walking legs per segment.\n\nMillipedes (Class Diplopoda, previously also known as Chilognatha) are very elongated arthropods with cylindrical bodies that have two pairs of legs for each one of their 20 to 100 or more body segments (except for the first segment behind the head which does not have any appendages at all, and the next few which only have one pair of legs). Each segment that has two pairs of legs is a result of two single segments fused together as one. The millipede's most obvious feature is its large number of legs. If you want to know how many legs a millipede has, count the number of body segments and multiply by four. Its name is a compound word formed from the Latin roots milli (""thousand"") and ped (""foot"") meaning ""thousand foot"" but these creatures do not have a thousand legs, although there are rare species  like ""Illacme plenipes"" that have up to 750 legs.( Illacme plenipes, typically have more 650 legs; the leggiest ever found in 1926 had 750.  However, common species have between 80 and 400 legs.♥"

Genes contain instructions for the function of each cell in the body and are responsible for how we look, act and think. \n\nBut, just because your mother or father may have a mental illness doesn't mean you will have one. Hereditary just means that you are more likely to get the condition than if you didn't have an affected family member. \n\nExperts believe that many mental conditions are linked to problems in multiple genes -- not just one, as with many diseases -- which is why a person inherits a susceptibility to a mental disorder, but doesn't always develop the condition. \n\nThe disorder itself occurs from the interaction of these genes and other factors -- such as psychological trauma and environmental stressors -- which can influence, or trigger, the illness in a person who has inherited a susceptibility to it. \nUnfortunately, most mental illnesses are caused by a combination of factors and cannot be prevented."

"3","how can i loose weight with slip disc?","i had slip disc since 2002 at l4 l5 region. CANT run or swim . i have acidity prob so cant diet. how sucsessful is disc replacement surgery. i ve 10 kg extra weight. how to get back in shape and over with slip disc","Your body burns alot of calories just keeping all your systems  going.\nThe trick is to keep your body in a calorie burning mode not a calorie storage mode.\nWhen you mention acidity problems (in addition to the extra weight) I jump to the conclusion that you eat meals and snacks that do not contain protein. Your stomach assumes you'll include protein every time you eat. The acid your stomach produces is only for breaking down proteins. No protein means nothing for the acid to do so it is 'in excess'.\nEvery time you eat a meal or snack without protein it usually means it's high in starch or sugar. When you eat starchy or sugary meals/snacks you body produces insulin which switches you from a calorie burning mode to a calorie storage mode. Insulin tells your body to store fat. You will also end up producing extra insulin which causes your blood sugar to drop and giving you cravings.\n\nLosing the weight is probably the best thing you can do for your back (and feet, and knees, and heart, and eyes, and......) Don't let the sugar/starch addiction control you and keep you down.\n\nCut down on the sugar/starches in your meals and add more fat and protein. Don't skip meals (causes insulin spikes when you finally do eat) and try to eat Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack. Your brain likes the sugar spikes and won't want you to change. Keep your blood sugar stable and you will be strong enough to do it. The weight will come off.\n\nSimple walking is a great way to burn more caloreis while in the calorie burning mode."

"1","Poll – How do you interpret this Scripture passage about women?","NOTE: Below is the particular passage… but more reading maybe required.\n\n1 Corinthians 14:33-35\n[33] For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints, [34]  women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.  [35]  If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.  (NIV)\n\nPossible Interpretations:\n\nA) Women should not speak at all… in gathered assemblies. \n--- Which, to me, doesn’t make sense --- in light of 1 Corinthians 11:5\n\nB) Women are supposed to show respect and not disrupt the assembly by noisy discussions, talking in the background, and etc.\n\nPlease try your best to prove your point --- your thoughts in this matter are important.","This passage has gotten a lot of attention over the years - It seems everyone knows this passage - whether they know anything else about the Bible or not!\nMany (most?) overlook the fact that this command does not stand alone. Paul had already given this command for silence twice in the same passage - once applied to those who speak in tongues, and once to the prophets, and finally to the women. In all three cases, a close examination of the original language will show that the exact same words are used each time, however, most translations render it differently for the command to women.\nIn these three verses, ""be silent"" had to do with taking turns. It is not a unilateral command to for all time - it is a call for order and direction; for the proper use of the giftings God has bestowed on the various members of the church.\n\nPaul was making sure that women were not left out of the church! He knew that they were at a disadvantage in the culture, with little (closer to NO) opportunity for education. Paul sought to eradicate that, so that by their husband's instruction, they could function as peers. This might seem like a small thing today, but at that time it was HUGE. Even while he was correcting the chaos of the church, he was providing a way for the women to better themselves. His words were not harsh authoritarianism, relegating women to to some narrow role. On the contrary, they were opening new doors of opportunity for those who society had excluded and ingnored.\nClose examination of other Scriptures will reveal that Paul considered, Chloe, Priscilla, Stephana, and Phoebe, to be Annointed by God to leadership positions withing the church.\nPriscilla instructed Apollos, and neither Luke, nor Paul criticized this fact.\nThere is considerable evidence to suggest that Priscilla could have been the writer of the book of Hebrews.\nPaul even mentions pointedly that Phoebe was a deacon of the church in Chencrea."

They can cause no symptoms, 1 symptom up to 100's of symptoms! Good thing that you are getting tested and checked out. \nNow, since we don't have all day, I cannot go into the complexities of thyroid and diabetes. My suggestion is to run to the library or closest Barnes and Noble Bookstore and pick up a book on thyroid. One easy to understand one is Mary Shamon's ""Living Well With Hypothyroidism"". That's a good place to start. Don't like books, go to about.com and go into their health area or thyroid forums."

We in the family are all very proud of Stash, he made a name for himself in the greater Milwaukee area. He started off as a butcher's assistant in Lithuania and when he got to the states received employment immediately at Lemanoski's Butcher Block in downtown Milwaukee...hence his love for good Kielbasa. \n\nStash was always a good accordion man. He started off with the usual Polkas, but grew more in love with the rap scene \nthere in Milwaukee. You might know Milwaukee is considered one of the hotbeds of rap. He and the boys from the Butcher Block had many a jam session in the chopping room of the shop. Stash, God bless him, would keep that bloody apron on and let the music flow. Many a good time was had with the Old Milwaukee beer and Kielbasa. \n\nIt was there in the back room of the butcher shop that Stash and the boys came up with ""Play That Funky Polka\nWhite Boy"" a song that flew to the top of the charts. The rest is history from there. This summer, Stash will be \nposthumously inducted into the Polka Rap Hall of Fame \nin Scranton, Pennsylvania. \n\nOur family is all so proud."

"2","can a woman who is not pregnant and hasnt been pregnant in over 17 years encourage breast milk to be produced?","trying to find out if its possible for a female to produce milk without being pregnant ....so she can still breast feed","Tough one...in order to produce breast milk, first there must be an increase in the number and size of mammary ducts and glands within the breast. Then you'll need prolactin, a hormone from the pituitary gland, to stimulate production of breast milk. Lastly, secretion of breast milk largely depends on oxytocin (the letdown reflex). All of these hormones are greatly increased during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and non-pregnant serum prolactin and oxytocin levels are actually pretty low. As such, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a non-pregnant woman to prodice breast milk."

"2","Why is the Tone of Microphone Feedback ""High Pitched""???","O.K. I have a good idea that Microphone feed back is caused by sound looping into the Mic out of the Speaker and back into the Mic and so on and so on. But why is the the tone so high pitched?","Aside from circuitry considerations (which can not be ignored) short waves are more penetrating than long waves.  For example light waves and X-rays are both electromagnetic but the shorter X-rays can penetrate flesh and bone.  short UV waves penetrate clouds to give you a sunburn on a less than sunny day.  Short microwaves penetrate food in an oven right through the container.  A piccolo can be heard easily above an entire marching band (as in Stars and Stripes Forever).  Therefore, the microphone is more apt to ""hear"" higher tones and amplify them even more than low tones and hear them from the speaker even louder, etc. etc."

You can see the variation in the story that each branch of your family tells.\n\nWhere Revelation comes in (and this is where it is often gotten wrong) is that it confirms the story and brings it to a higher plain of understanding.  It is not like the Hebrews didn't know the Genesis account and the book fell out of the sky one day and hit Moses on the head.  Rather God work with Moses to confirm the story and the Lord of History revealed what was clouded and lost."

I'd say in about 4-6 more weeks you'll be completely recovered.\n\nThere's no risk of breaking the tendon by weight, but you could collapse against it and fall and break something else. Or, if during the surgery, they stitched it, by putting weight on it you could break the stitches. Just don't put weight on it.\n\nNo real vitamins help, but if you'd want real help on that, go see your doctor or a nutrition specialist. I don't think that vitamins will really help tendons though.\n\nWhatever happens, just remember to take the time recovering. Don't try to rush yourself. I did that when i broke my leg in 5 places at once, and since then, my leg hasn't been perfect."

So can we say that all the name of GODS mentioned in the different religious books (ALLAH, LORD, JEHOVA etc.) designate the same power?? If it is true so why there is so much hate between religions??","A very good question.\nThere are several questions within your one. \nI believe: ( through research and not belonging to any one religion)\n\nReligions define God by a name which is inherent in the human mind to tag something to understand it( tree, dog, human).  With the understanding of infinite thought and probabilities the One religions refer to is the same God.  The Source.  The source of light, dark and all existence.  This is one entity or energy.  \n\nThe paths we as humans choose to find this source is our differing religions each with their merits and flaws.  We seek the same source.  Eventually. \n\nThe Source is no 'man' or 'woman' sitting on a throne being wise, judge mental and all knowing it (It) is simply everything.  That was, will be, is or may be.  It is the fabric which which binds everything.  Before man began to categories or define it.\n\nThe second question within yours hints at the 'prophets' question of the being the only way to the Source. Jesus, Mohamed, Quetzalcoatl, Buddha etc. (note we are speaking only of the prophets of Light) each proclaim that their way is their path God. The ultimate source.\n\nHumans are different in their perceptions of everything so it is reasonable that God would have conceived of different paths to reach the One, ie enlightenment."

"2","Why does sound travel faster through a less dense gas, but also faster through water than air?","Sound waves travel faster through MORE dense fluids, such as water, and solid objects than through the air, and also travel faster through LESS dense fluids (helium) than through air. why?","Sound travels faster through water because the particles in water are already touching each other (in gases the particles are all spread out). [the other answers have dealt with this in more detail]\n\nHelium is less dense than air becuase helium molecules weigh less than regular air molecules (a molecule of helium is two helium atoms, so its atomic weight is 2x 2 = 4. Air is mostly nitrogen, with molecular weight 2x 14 = 28).\n\nHowever, the molecules in helium are almost exactly as close together as the molcules in air. In fact, in any gas, one mole of molecules takes up the same amount of space - 24 litres at standard temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\nSo, sound can travel faster through helium because the particles are the same distance apart as air, but they are lighter so it is easier to get them moving."

The reason Night & Day is approved for overnight wear is that they let more oxygen through to the front of your eye (the cornea).  Some people have higher oxygen demands and so are only able to wear the lenses during the day.  Of the people who are allowed to sleep in them, some choose not to because the contacts just don't feel good after wearing them all night.  If your eye doctor did approve you for overnight wear, you need to make sure that you are disinfecting your contacts as directed (most solutions require at least 4 hours for proper disinfection)."

"1","True or false are women much cleaner than men?","","Anytime a man and a woman are together, the potential for magic or mayhem exists. Our world has yet to accept the very special gift we’ve been given in being so different. We have not learned to utilize the awesome power available to us in the man-woman dynamic. There are many games to play in this world, but nothing can bring more joy than the man-woman game. There is no finer playing field than relating with the opposite sex to experience all aspects of love and life.\n\nIn order to effectively relate to one another, we must understand and appreciate, the underlying makeup of men and women. Women bring the appetite and desire to the planet. Men bring their capability to produce. In order to move efficiently around the game board of man-woman, we need to recognize women are better than men in the area of desire, and men are more effective than women in producing to satiate those desires.\n\nWe were not created different by accident. The plan has always been perfect, but we have resisted the perfection of our differences. This resistance has been the source of the majority of man-woman breakdowns.\n\nWomen are best at what they want. Men are best at making it happen. Women are the ones who wanted indoor plumbing. Women are the ones who wanted beds up off the floor. They wanted a roof over their head. They wanted more blankets and food for their children. Women are the ones who wanted transportation and markets to do their shopping. They wanted materials to make different clothes; ones for winter and ones for summer. Women have always wanted their basic needs of food, shelter and clothing met. Women wanted, and men provided. Life was simple. It’s not to say that women didn’t make things happen along the way. The truth is, women made everything happen simply by expressing their desires. They wanted more pleasurable experiences.\n\nTimes have changed, and the women of today need to allow men to be men, and empower them to do more of what they do best. Men want women to know they are completely capable of producing whatever women want and need, as long as they are given the opportunity.\n\nOver the past several decades, women have taken on more of the male role of producing. If this continues, we will end up with too much male energy on the planet. The planet doesn’t need more male energy - it needs more feminine energy.\n\nWomen are coming into their power in new and wonderful ways. It’s time for them to pull back from producing so much, and move more into directing. This will allow men to support women in moving things in the direction of the feminine. This will bring balance back to a world where the feminine energy is wanted and needed.\n\nRomance goes out the window when women take on a man’s role. In the times when chivalry was alive and well, women were definitely more feminine. They were happy to be female. They played their part with grace and ease. Men were heroic and romantic. They were happy to court women and women were delighted to be courted. Can you imagine if women were galloping off to slay dragons for their men? When women do the man’s job, it leaves little room for men to be their heroes. There is no game to play, or dragon to slay. It results in no romance.\n\nMark lived in Texas with Allison. Allison had a vacation magazine that had a beautiful picture of an island with gorgeous turquoise waters. She lit up every time she looked at it. One day Mark said to her, “Would you like to go there?” She said, “Yes, that would be like a dream.” That was all she said. The next day Mark bought tickets for them to go. She was simply enjoying the picture and thinking about how much fun it would be to go there. She was not trying to manipulate him in any way. This is different than a woman who asks, “Would you take me there?” or, “Why can’t we go?” There’s no opportunity for men to be the hero if women get their own ‘production’ muscle involved.\n\nWhen a woman expresses her desires, sh"
"1","Please Help?","Okay I'am writing an essay for my health carwe college course, and I just need to know what does Le medidecine liberale mean? its french I think it means the lberal medicine, but I cld be wrong, and what does it symbolizes? is it a special saying?","In contrast to Britain, following the Second World War, France was not a pathbreaker in the domain of social policy. Although the Laroque Report was instrumental in laying the foundations for a social security system based on the notion of national solidarity, unlike the Beveridge Report, it did not reassess the role of the State in assuming responsibility for the general welfare (2). Nor was its influence as broad as that of the Beveridge Report. Whereas the British State increased its control over the health system in one swoop through the nationalization of hospitals and the creation of the NHS in 1948, the French State increased its control more gradually while involving business groups - the palronal - and trade unions in the management of the social security system. As a result of exercising such prudence before tampering with (lie financing of medical care, the French health system is char acterizcd by the co-existence of NHI and private medical practice under fee-for-service reimbursement - what the French call la medecine liberale.La medecine liberale  \n       As far as the provision of medical services is concerned, in French - particularly the medical ambulatory care sector, the French profession - are deeply attached to a set of principles associated with la medecine liberale: selection of the physician by the patient and vice versa, clinical freedom for the doctor, professional confidentiality and, above all, fee-for-service payment. In the hospital sector, the French are committed not merely to the co-existence of public and private non-profit hospitals but also to proprietary hospitals (cliniques) which account for almost 20 per cent of the total number of beds. \n       La medecine liberale can be traced to an often idealized past when the health sector was a cottage industry. Office and home visits were the predominant modes of medical practice and physicians were neither concerned about primary prevention such as occupational health programmes, nor about the diffusion of medical technology, nor about regional teaching hospitals. Since the passage of the first health insurance law in 1928, French professional medical associations have sedulously cultivated an image of the personal, symbiotic doctor-patient relationship. The principles of la medecine liberale were first elaborated in a document called la Charle Medicale, in 1927. In 1955, they were codified by executive decree in the 'Code de Deontologie Medicale.'  \n       Despite the strength and centralization of French public administration, there are few countries where private fee-for-service practice has been more established than in France. Since the Second World War, however, as in other industrially advanced nations, French physicians have practised in a socio-economic context whose growth and changing patterns have transformed the health sector from a cottage industry to a major industrial complex. In the face of such change, the French state has wavered between protecting the prerogalives of la medecine liberale and adapting the health sector to the demands of a modern economy. On the one hand, policymakers have acceded to pressures from the medical profession and the hospital industry; on the other, they have' protected the right of access to medical care by extending health insurance coverage and introducing controls over physicians and hospitals."

There may be two reasons:  (1)  The person has reached a high level of consciousness and believes he can do no harm (to himself) by leaving this body - and, perhaps, feels he must ""go beyond"" to learn more; (2)  The person has reached a false state of nirvana and, during a brief ""high"" (peaceful state), he decides to ""go beyond"" thinking it is even more peaceful (and longer lasting).\n\nIn the case of #1 above, the question arises ""When does one 'know' he has reached the True state of Nirvana - that is, the highest level of heaven or personal peace.

Can this condition heal it's self? Or is this a problem I am stuck with forever? I have severe marked  pain in both my back and left leg. I am worried that injections will not help me, Since I have had this injury for over a year, with no treatment. I guess my dr. didn't believe I had the pain until, I got real forceful and told them I wanted my back checked. So they did an MRI, and found the protrusion. I have an appointment with the pain dr. on the 30th to find out if I am a good canidate for injections.  mostly I really need to know, can this injury heal it's self?","Well  Deb lucky you, running into me. I've had surgery eight times in this area: the answers are No, it won't heal and No the injections won't heal and you do need surgery, your life as you know it is over.\n   This is why I'm so darned smart, I'm always in school because I can hardly walk and, it's getting worse.

"2","how does the brain, which part, tell the heart to beat and how does the heart pump blood back to the brain?","","The basic heartbeat is controlled by cells in the heart which have leaky membranes-Ions leak in, and depolarize the cell, which then causes a rapid spreading contraction.  Thus, the brain does not control basal heartrate.  The brain, through mediation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system can, however, modulate the rate of the heartbeat.  There are some specific loci which are associated with these systems, but the most potent is the emotive centers of the brain, which in turn are regulated by the cerebral cortex (the ""thinking"" part of your brain), which is why, when you are told you just flunked a test, your heartbeat rises, while when you listen to relaxing music, your heartbeat slows.  The conscious part of your mind sends signals to the emotive centers, which then regulate the symapthetic and parasympathetic system.  But, cutting off your head will not stop your heart from beating...at least not until the heart itself runs out of oxygen because of the lack of breathing."

"3","How do you know if u have a yest infection?? My little sis keeps asking.?","","Most women associate a thick discharge that looks like cottage cheese with the Candida bug, although only about 20% experience it. If it is present, the discharge may either have a starchy odor to it, or perhaps none at all, and its color can vary from white to a more yellowish tinge. \n\nSince not everyone gets the discharge, the easiest way for a woman to tell that she has a yeast infection is that she itches in and around her vagina. A lot. The itchiness may be accompanied by a burning sensation, and her vulvar area can be red and swollen. It may also burn or be generally painful for her to urinate, and sex may become painful as well. A good way to distinguish the burning on urination that is due to a yeast infection vs. a urinary tract infection is to pay close attention to exactly when the burning starts and stops. With yeast, the burning is due to acidic urine hitting the irritated skin of the vulva, so the burning starts when the urine reaches the outside. With urinary tract infection, the burning is felt as the urine passes down the tube on its way out. \n\nWhile these are the general symptoms of a yeast infection, every woman may experience one differently. She may identify an infection by the smell and consistency of the discharge, which can be unique to her. However, certain symptoms definitely do not go along with a simple yeast infection, and they may indicate that something more serious is going on. For example, if she is feverish or is experiencing pelvic pain, these are definitely indications that she ought to see her doctor in order to receive a proper diagnosis and medical care."

"3","how to lose weight without excercise and no dieting ?","","try taboo\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... ""Bible"", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck"

"2","what is the difference between a transmission and a scanning electron microscope?","","the difference is where the detector goes.  in both microscopes, electrons are fired downwards (usually) from an electron gun towards the sample of interest.  \n\nin a TEM the detector is on the underside of the sample, looking up.  that means the electrons have to pass through the sample, so it has to be sufficiently thin to allow the electrons to pass through.\n\nin an SEM the detector is above, but off at an angle.  instead of picking up transmitted electrons, it picks up electrons that are scattered backwards from the surface.  this works better for thick samples, but doesn't tell you anything about what's beneath the surface.\n\nso a TEM gives you a cross-sectional (2D) view and an SEM gives you a pretty 3D picture of the surface only."

"3","Is fountain water just as good for you as bottled water and how much should i drink?","i buy bottled water but wanted to know if its ok to fill the empty bottles with fountain water just to drink more and not pay so much for bottled water.","there is a study done that IF you drink only bottled water, your body immunity goes down after a while.  This is due to the fact that you are constantly drinking filtered water and your body gets used to having the most essential food/fluid namely water in a very sterile form.  This makes your body get more and more used to a sterile environment and your body reacts to this by getting lazier and lazier.  Think this way, no excercise, your muscles become flab.  Anyway doctors recommend that you drink tap water from time to time just to help build immunity.\n\nI used to think this was false until I started to read up on my pet triton cockatoo.  Many sites said that washing your cage every other day to keep it spic and span is not the best for your bird since it needs to build immunity. And it's not possible in a extremely clean environment.  I think you can apply the same reasoning to bottled water.\n\nAs for the amount, I don't know and have never read it myself.

"2","would u help me with the algorithm of maze robots?","I have robotic compitition next month \ncould u help me with the algorithm of maze robots?","MAZE NAVIGATION ALGORITHM\n\nPart 1\n\n    A guaranteed way to to solve a maze is to stick to a wall and always try to turn one direction or the other.  It is not the most efficient way but it works all the time.  This is how the Boe-Bot solves mazes.  It hugs the left wall.  IR sensors are mounted on the left and front sides of the robot.  It begins the maze with a forward movement.  After that it checks the left IR.  If left is open, it turns left, moves forward, and repeats the process.  If left is closed, the robot checks the front.  If front is open, the robot moves forward and repeats the process.  If the front is also closed, the  robot turns right.  It then checks the front IR sensor to determine if the new front is open.  If its open, the robot moves forward and repeats the process.  If it is closed, the robot again turns right and moves forward (the way it just came) and repeats the process.  The flow chart summarizes all these instructions.  Each time the robot makes a movement (forward, left, or right) it records a F,L, or R to a memory block in the EEPROM by using the WRITE function in Stamp BASIC.  The variable 'total_moves' is incremented each time a movement is written.  \n\n    The forward, left, and right subroutines use the PULSOUT function to move the servos.  The pulsout variables for each servo (eg. 699, 879) are not set in stone.  They have been changed numerous times and will probably need to be played with more.   We determined them partly by experiment and largely by trial and error.  The results of those experiments are also published in this site.  \n\n    At the beginning of the forward subroutine is the BUTTON function.  Each time through this subroutine, the programs checks to see if the button has been depressed.  If it has not, the program continues.  If the button has been pressed, control is moved to the find_RR subroutine.\n\nPart 2\n\n    When the program enters part 2, the robot has already left the maze and the button has been pressed.  It enters the find_RR subroutine and first pauses for 10 seconds so the robot can be repositioned at the starting point to re-do the maze.  Find_RR is a superfluous piece of code that originated from poor planning.  It reads in the movement from each memory block and the following memory block (blocks n and n+1) and compares them to each other.  If it detects a R,R combo, it replaces the first R with an A.  It then copies each movement into the previous one.  For example, it would change a FFRRFLF to a FFAFLF.  Each time it finds an RR combo and replaces it with an A, all the code following the last R must be adjusted. Therefore, the 'total_moves' variable is reduced by 1 each time RR is detected.  The write_A subroutine handles that task.  If no RR combo is found (they've all been switched) control moves to the find_A subroutine.\n\n    Find_A searches each memory block for the 'A' movement.  If no 'A' is found, control moves to the done subroutine.  However, this will only occur after all the 'A' have been dealt with.  When an 'A' is found, the memory location is stored in variable 'counter' and control goes to subroutine surround_A.  The purpose of surround_A is to determine all of the movements before and after the 'A' that need to be ignored for successful completion of the maze.  \n\n    After the robot completes the maze for the first time, and changes the 'RR' to 'A' the code will something like:\n\n        F F F L F A F R F F L F  this is for the hypothetical situation shown here:\n\n\n\n To eliminate the unwanted code, the pairs of movements surrounding A are examined and compared to the green, blue and purple patterns.\n\nF                F                F            L                F            A                F                R                F                F            L            F\n\n0                1                 2            3                4   "

At u=0 the graph is going to equl to (0,1) and at 9 it will look like (9, e^9).

This is an example of gradient index optics."

As for how often, I would say divide the ammount that you drink daily into 8-18oz servings spread throughout the day whenever you can.  I generally drink the mixture 4 - 6 times a day.  I spread them somewhat evenly throughout the day but find it helpful to listen to my bodies cravings.  If I feel hungry or am craving food, thats when I mix the cleanser up and it generally takes that craving away.\n\nGood luck!"

"3","What's the best way to remove hair (you know pubic hair)?","","Personally I used to wax, but OUCH!! Way too painful, definitly would not recommend that, unless you have a very high threshold for pain. But I would actually recommend checking out laser hair removal. It's starting to catch on and is really effective. But there are side effects like irritation from the laser, risk of pigment discolouration and pain. It works best if you have really dark, coarse-ish hair, and kinda light skin. If your dark, there's the risk or pigment discolouration where the area that's lasered becomes lighter than it's surrounding area. It is painful, I won't lie, but it only lasts as long as they're firing the gun. It just feels like lost of small elastics snapping your skin. And the cold cloth after feels SOOO good. But I've just finished up treatments for my bikini area and wow. I am amazed. It took about 5 treatments for the hair to be totally removed, and now it's completely smooth and I don't have to worry about it! It is pricey, so just be ready to spend close to $1000 for larger areas, like legs and arms, and $600 for bikini and underarms. But I say, if you can afford it, and are willing to, go for a consulation (they're generally free), and totally go for it. And that's my little plug for laser hair removal."

"3","Is it bad to crack your knuckles?","","if you crack your knuckles often enough, you can end up with swollen ligaments.\n\nA study looked at 300 people who had been cracking knuckle joints for 35 years. They had slightly swollen joints (which is no big deal). But the real surprise was that their hands were weaker - their grip strength was one quarter as strong as it should been!\n\nIt does NOT cause arthritis. In fact, it's not dangerous at all, said Dr. Jonathan Kay, clinical director of the rheumatology unit at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n""The cracking sound you hear when you pull on your fingers is caused by the release of negative pressure within the joint,"" he said. Inside every joint in the body, a gooey substance called synovial fluid coats the surfaces of cartilage to protect them. Just as two discs coated with mineral oil stick together and can only be pulled apart with a bit of force, so it is inside the joint. When you pull, you break the vacuum seal created by the synovial fluid and the breaking of that seal causes the popping sound -- from the bursting of bubbles of gases dissolved in the fluid.\nCuriously, it takes about 20 minutes for the seal to re-establish itself. So crack your knuckles all you want. You might stretch a few ligaments, but you will not give yourself arthritis. But it'll be no fun unless you wait 20 minutes between cracks."
"3","How many hours should you wait to eat before and after excercise?","","How many hours or minutes you should eat before exercising depends on each individual. I wait 30 to 50 minutes after eating before I exercise, but your body may not be able to wait 60 minutes. Listen to your body. If you feel sick after waiting 30 minutes, wait longer. If you feel like you don't have enough energy after waiting 60 minutes, exercise sooner.\n\nAs for after exercising, I've always heard that it's best to eat something 30 minutes to an hour after hydrating. However, just like eating before exercising, it probably depends on the person."

"1","Why do I never see or hear from the Jewish (the religion, not ethnicity)?","I've seen answers from Christians, atheists, a few from Muslims, and those who promote Buddhist philosophy. Actually, I don't hear anything about Hinduism, either, but I  hear NEVER about the Jewish religion or ever see them anywhere.","Several of us will pop up when we see the word Jewish, Judaism, Torah, etc. in the question.  I for example just found your question by putting the word ""Jewish"" in the search for open questions.  I used to scroll through all the questions but that has become too tedious lately and I don't answer on Christian or general Bible matters because I have no need to impose my beliefs on anyone else. \n\nPersonally I think it's time there were subcategories under R&S, so that we can all have a forum to discuss things without constantly being interrupted by people who are not respectful.  To me that's like someone going into a section on mathematics and saying ""i hate math"".  If you don't like the topic, just stay away.  For example when someone asks a question about Jesus, I don't think it's necessary for someone atheist to comment, ""he's a figment of your imagination"" and by the same token I as a Jew, would NOT comment ""he's not the messiah"" even if that's what I believe.  I don't feel it's my place and it is not relevant to the question being asked. Everyone has a right to their beliefs and I don't need to chime in with my opinion every two seconds.  In fact the ones who do this are probably insecure with their belief systems and feel a need to be loud about it.   \n\nAnd for questions asked about Judaism I only answer the ones asked respectfully.  You can tell when someone really wants to know or they just want to spout their own prejudices and are not open to answers. If you scroll through my answers you can see I have answered many questions on Judaism that were asked in a thoughtful and respectful manner.\n\nWell, I hope that answers your question somewhat... :)"

Low-income people spend all their savings in weedings and parties that they give to their relatives or extended family and even neighbours just because it gives them status... how silly!  I do not identify with that but I understand it.  Also mexicans are always 'worried' about the future and they daydream about winning the lottery... or that things will come from heaven... they never take their present and plan from it... they built up on water, as it were, and I'm not like that.  Also mexicans are too religious but they are religious because 'yes'... Do you believe in GOD? 'yes' Why? 'I don't know but I believe'... hmmm I'm not like that... Also mexicans say that it is better to do something even if it is not well done but it is done... and I think that if you are to do something (anything) you have to do it in the best possible way.  Also mexicans have a saying 'There's more time than life'... and they don't care if they arrive on time or not... as they see the future events as a 'question mark'... because of what I already said, they do not see unpunctuality as an offense and I do.\n\nI hope that answers what you're looking for."

"3","How many units of alcohol should a female consume in one week, what is the danger limit, and how many units is","","Units of alcohol. It has no scientific grounding. It was a group of doctors, who decided to set limits on what people should drink. Given that current unit measurements are massively inaccurate, that they were devised when a standard beer was under 4% abv, it's not so much the units drunk, but the pattern in which they are drunk. A couple of glasses of wine each night will cause few problems, but the same quantity in one night is much more problematic. \n\nThe reason why women can drink less than men, is because alcohol is water soluble, it is more easily absorbed into muscle tissue, which men naturally have more of. So, if you are a muscular woman, you can probably drink more than a very thin woman."

No medications.","acidophilus (spelling might be wrong) it's actually a bacteria that helps to replenish your normal flora so it can fight the yeast infection.  Cranberry Juice helps, just because it helps to make the area a deadly pH for yeast... but there's aways vagisil to help with the itching and burning while you wait... but the natural way will take longer than the MD way and it's not always guaranteed to work the first time... the key is prevention."

"1","How can a person be speaking in tongues without using the language center of their brains?","There's been some articles on studies done on persons Born Again and speaking in tongues. The studies show that the individuals aren't experiencing mental breakdowns or personality disorders that may result in hearing voices.\n\nTwo items of interest is that none of the test subjects spoke any known language, which was explained that they were speaking the language of the angels. But, when the Apostles received the Holy Spirit and spoke tongues, it was for a purpose, to spread God's Word to many nations, all with different languages.\n\nThe other item of interest was that the test subjects were not using the language centers of the human brain. You would assume, that regardless of what language they would be speaking, they would be using the language center of the brain, unless they were speaking gibberish.  \n\nI imagine someone has an explanation, but it seems to me that in everything, God uses what is available. Wouldn't he also use that portion of the brain meant for languages?","It seems that they are speaking gibberish, but that they don't know it.  They essentially trick themselves into having this religious experience.  This is not saying that someone CANNOT speak in tongues through the Holy Spirit, but only that if they did, only that the examples we see today do not appear to be actual supernatural experiences.  Every linguist who has studied various individuals speaking in tongues has stated that what is being spoken is not an actual language (not just a known language, but that it isn't language).  There are those also that believe they have the gift of interpreting these tongues.  But, when a recording of someone speaking in a tongue has been brought to several interpreters, the interpretations are not the same.  \n\nPeople can trick themselves into believing they are speaking in tongues, or that they understand these tongues, but when put to the test, these ""miracles"" do not seem to be miraculous at all.  These people are not bad people, just fooled."
"3","How to stop regretting so much?","I always worry and I always regret about almost everything that I've done. And also, after almost everyday at school or every social outing I would be tormented by my 'reflections' on every single bit of detail that has happened just now, e.g. 'oh i shouldn't have said that' or 'i said that. what would they think?' 'was i acting stupid by doing that?'\n\nSometimes it's so bad that it wakes me up at night and it disrupts me from concentrating on my work. I can't block them from my mind. Sometimes these thoughts would just flow though me and this would greatly affect my mood. Once I was driving and some of these thoughts were running thru my head and suddenly i just started crying a lot and got breathless and I had to stop the car because i couldn't see the road anymore. I also feel that this 'worrying thing' of mind has gotten worse...makes me overly cautious of people and this prevents me from making friends in the way that i used to. \n\nAdvice?

"2","Can anyone tell me that what is the total quantity of Uranium on Earth????","","Uranium is a naturally occurring element found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. This is the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth.\n\nIt is considered to be more plentiful than antimony, beryllium, cadmium, gold, mercury, silver, or tungsten and is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. It is found in many minerals including uraninite (also called pitchblende, most common uranium ore), autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from these sources).\n\nUranium is found to some extent in the majority of rocks and sediments making up the Earth's crust, but is never found in concentrated deposits. \n\nThe most common uranium ore is pitchblende, which consists of a mixture of UO2 with U3O8. The largest known source of pitchblende is located in the Leopolville mines, in Congo, Africa. \n\nOther uranium containing minerals are euxenite, carnotite, brannerite and coffinite. The largest deposits of these ores are located in the USA, Canada, Russia and France."

Determine the values of x in the domain of  f for which f(x) = 28.\n\nI am really stuck and would appreciate any help!  Thank you!","Since f(x) is a parabola that opens upward, you need the minimum value, which is the y-coordinate of the vertex.  The x-coordinate is -(-12)/(2•3) = 2.  So the minimum y is at 3(2)² - 12(2) + 13 = 1, and your range is y >= 1.\n\nFor the second part, just solve 3x² - 12x + 13 = 28.\n\n3x² - 12x - 15 = 0\nx² - 4x - 5 = 0\n(x-5)(x+1) = 0\nx = 5 or x = -1."

"3","do i have diabetes?","i eat healthy all day, but by sundown i NEED sugar. not want it. NEED it. i get shaky and jittery and paranoid, untill i eat it. help?","There's high and low sugar problems.   High sugar is craving sweets, rolls, breads, cakes, pizzas, which results in blurred vision, being ""foggy,"" temper outbursts and making some very bad decisions. \n\nPeople with true diabetes (not the ones who wail because their sugar went up to 130 because they ate an entire chocolate cake---those aren't diabetics, those are idiots), can have blood sugars ranging from 30 to 700.   On the same day.   Talk about being sick.\n\n Mine are usually extremely high, in the 400s.   The lowest mine has ever been was 30, and I was coherent enough to get help, but that was a very bad situation.   \n\nYours sounds like the low end, which can be remedied by diet.   Are you exercising a lot?   Burning more carbs than you're taking in?    That can bring it down to where you get nauseous, and feel like you're being vacuumed from the inside out.  Low blood sugars can also result if you have a few alcoholic drinks at the end of the day.   \n \nWhen you feel shaky, don't indulge in candy and cake.   Those are the wrong kind of sugars to balance you out.    Stick with fruits if at all possible.   Cantelopes are quick fixes.     Yes, Orange juice works, but milk is even better if you are REALLY low.   There are also glucose pills that you can carry with you easily, if you are active and away from all the good food.\n\nYou do need to get it checked, tho.   It certainly sounds like diabetes.    If it gets too low, you could pass out, wreck your car or hurt someone,  or go into a coma yourself.    It's not something to play around.   I didn't take it seriously for years, and now take four shots a day.    Take care of yourself!!!!!!!!!!"
"2","how many stars that i can see when its really dark, not there any more?","Like I’m not going to count like say there’s 100% that I can see what percents left and it there new ones and is that more than what I see or less?","There's a relative way to interpret your question as well.  \nWhen you look at the stars, you're seeing them because of the light that travels from them to you.  It takes time for the light to reach you.  So, you're not seeing the stars as they are ""now"".  You're seeing them as they were in the past.  They may not even be there any longer.  They may have gone nova or even supernova (if big enough), but the information of that event traveling at the speed of light hasn't reached us yet.  Just  remember it's all relative.  So, depeneding on which oberserver you ask and how you define certain terms...just how many stars that you can see are really there?"

"2","If x is an integer and 2<x<7, how many different triangles are there with sides of 2, 7, and x?","The answer to this question is One. Why is that?","The two smaller sides must always add up to more than the largest side (otherwise you can't make a triangle).  Since the sides must be *integer* sides, the only valid triangle is 2, 6 and 7.\n\nStated another way, here are the combinations:\n2-3-7, impossible triangle (try connecting the 2 and 3 sides together...)\n2-4-7, impossible triangle (try connecting the 2 and 4 sides together...)\n2-5-7, straight line, not a triangle\n2-6-7, valid triangle\n\nSo there is only one combination (2-6-7) that makes a triangle when x is an *integer* greater than 2 and less than 7."
"2","how do motion sensors detect movement?","","It really depends on the motion sensor. There are two types, active and passive. Active sensors include the sensors that open grocery store doors (these send out microwave radio energy then wait for it to bounce back), also alarms that emit beams of light (if the beam is broken the change in light is detected). Active sensors basically send something out into the environment and receive the changes. The motion sensor in most alarm systems are considered passive dectectors because they don't emit anything, but detect changes in energy such as infrared energy. These are usually set to detect small changes in the temperature of the human body. One cool experiment is if you stand behind a window, the motion sensors won't ""see"" you! This is because glass isn't a good conductor of infrared energy. Either way, these devices are interesting inventions!"

They usualy only come out at night.My second thought is that the feces and the garden thief may be 2 diff. animals. The feces with the fibers may be from an Owl or other large predatory bird that eats mice and other rodents, hence the fur or hair in the feces. Their are dogs that are known for being veg. thieves, my dog was a huge veg. thief. It may also be a Gopher tortoise which is unlikely. The coon is prob. your culprit.

""Unlike most other household power tools, welders and chain saws are two tools that may have a higher tendency to temporarily affect the normal function of your pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).  The spark discharge of the ignition system of a gasoline-powered chainsaw produces electromagnetic (EM) energy that may affect your pacemaker or ICD. Effects may be caused by current inadvertently conducted into your body (leakage current), or by the EM field. You may not feel the leakage current passing from one hand to the other through your body, but it may still interfere with the operation of your pacemaker or ICD. Gas chain saws that have the spark plug located near the handgrips pose a greater risk of conducting leakage current.\n\nYour pacemaker could continuously pace your heart if it were to detect either leakage current or the radiated EM field. This will result in an irregular heart rate if your heart were beating on its own. Your ICD could deliver a shock if it detects either leakage current or the radiated EM field.""\n\nMore at sites below.  First one is a site for a Pacemaker Club where you can ask questions and receive specific answers to pacemaker use.  Hope that helps!"
"1","question for liberals?","you claim to be against racism and constantly talk about how ugly and awful it is and how it's caused by lack of education and ignorance. my question is what do you think about these actual lyrics from black rappers?\n\n\n“Kill the white people; we gonna make them hurt; kill the white people; but buy my record first""\n\n“Niggas in the church say kill whitey all night long. . . . the white man is the devil. the CRIPS and Bloods are soldiers I’m recruiting with no dispute; drive-by shooting on this white genetic mutant. let’s go and kill some rednecks.""\n\n“A fight, a fight, a nigger and a white, if the nigger don’t win then we all jump in. smoking all America’s white boys” \n\n""I say kill whitey all nightey long.

I would kill a cracker for nothing, just for the fuck of it""\n\n“Won’t be satisfied until the devils.I see them all dead.my brother is sending me more guns from down South pale face.\n\n“He prays on old white ladies that drive the Mercedes""","Well, the problem happens when you start talking to people as groups rather than individuals. The singers of these lyrics do not represent ""The Black Race"" as a whole. Neither is there some monolithic group of ""Liberals"" who are all the same and all believe the same thing. Condemning lyrics you don't believe in makes sense, but you can't take that as having some kind of global implications for race relations. It's unfortunately a lot more complicated than that. The same way the rap singers are generalizing about ""America's white boys."""
"1","is Dante a black name or an italian name?","","Gender:\nMale \n\nEthnic Origin:\nItalian \n\nMeaning:\nA diminutive of Durante, the Italian form of Durand meaning enduring. Famous bearer: The poet Dante Alighieri wrote 'The Divine Comedy' with its graphic description of medieval Hell known as 'Dante's Inferno.'. \n\nDante is also used in Spanish speaking countries.\nAsking if it's a black name sounds kind of racist, asking if it's an ethnic based name sounds better.

"2","What is the difference between an ape and a gorilla?","Are they the same thing or two separate mammals within the same family?","There are two issues here. \nFirst, these terms refer to different logical classes. \nThe classification system that we use is based on inclusive (nested) categories and in that sense, the logical class ""ape"" includes the logical class ""gorilla"".\nBut there's another aspect to this.\nThe term gorilla refers to the animals belonging to one species, Gorilla gorilla (with different subspecies). In this case, the common word has a taxonomic equivalent.\n\nOn the contrary, ""ape"" does not have an exact equivalent in terms of systematic groupings or clades. In a general sense, ""apes"" are understood as Old World monkeys that lack a tail. They would include the families Pongidae (orangutan), Hominidae (chimpanzee, gorilla, man) and Hylobatidae (gibbons). However, for other people, the gibbons are ""lesser apes"" and the Pongidae are ""higher apes"". Many would also exclude man from the apes. Thus, for the authors of ""Planet of the Apes"", only the ""higher apes"" were included in the definition! \nIn consequence, there is no taxonomical equivalent for the common term ""ape"". A similar thing happens with ""monkeys"", that is, other Primates that have a long tail, are generally medium-sized and arboreal (including macaques, baboons, guenons, capuchins, marmosets, etc). This is another term that does not correspond to the systematic arrangement but rather includes several taxons."

I feel the pain in the skull in the upper part of skull over eyes. The pain is unbearable and I feel tremendous pressure in my head and nerves start heavily stretching. I feel that the nerves in the head will blast. Please note that I feel heavy pain in the area near to eyes both sides of the face. This happens only at the time of landing and not the take-off. I am really worried of this situation and I am scared of flying now. I've felt this type of pain eight times of out of nine times I flied. Please provide some suggestion what kind of problem it could be. Please let me know if you have any idea about what kind of problem I may have or if any more details regarding to my problem.","Airplanes are pressurized, but they aren't pefect.  Pressure inside the plane probably drops just a hair below atmospheric pressure as the plane ascends, and once again increases back to atmospheric pressure as it descends.\n\nYour head, especially the face, is full of air pockets called sinuses.  In addition to the sinuses that you see people complaining about in TV ads (i.e. the maxillary sinuses), there are the ethmoid sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, and frontal sinuses, plus others that I don't believe commmunicate with the external environment.  All of these sinuses are connected with the external environment via openings into your nose (you cannot see them, but an ENT physician deals with them all the time).  These openings allow the air pressure in the sinuses to equilibrate with the environment.  Furthermore, your middle ears are connected to the external environment via the Eustachian tubes which open into the nasopharynx.  Similarly, the pressure in the middle ear equilibrates with the pressure of the environment.\n\nSometimes, however, the openings of these sinuses in the nose can become obstructed for various reasons--infection being one of them.  Same situation with the Eustachain tubes.  I recall, as a child, having severe pain in my ears while on a plane.\n\nThis is where my knowledge is really lacking, but I'll give it a try.  I do know that middle ear infections are often very painful because of pressure accumilation due to obstructed Eustachian tubes (either obstructed or inflamed to the point where they no longer drain well into the nasopharynx).  Presumably the same applies to the sinuses in your face.  Inability to equilibrate with the environment, even if it's low pressure, may translate into pain.\n\nYou might want to ask your ENT about it, though."

Here is the map (which is a bit hard to understand- I admit- but those contour lines represent 2% changes in probability of a damaging earthquake):\nhttp://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/hazmaps/products_data/2002/2002October/CEUS/CEUSpga2500v3.gif\n\nNorthern Illinois is in an area that experiences relatively few earthquakes. The most recent earthquake in Illinois was a 3.6 magnitude quake near Harrisburg and Marion, Illinois, in the southern half of the state. The southern part of the state is within the hazard zone for the New Madrid Fault which is centered near New Madrid in southern Missouri, in the Bootheel. \n\nHere's the map for the Jan 2, 2006 earthquake near Harrisburg:\nhttp://neic.usgs.gov/neis/last_event_states/states_illinois.html\n\nTo give you an idea of what northern Illinois is like in terms of earthquakes, you might want to know that no earthquake over 3.5 magnitude has occurred in Wisconsin in the last 30 years. Likewise Iowa is almost as seismically quiet as Wisconsin. The map below from the University of Iowa shows the possible impact area of a large earthquake on the New Madrid Fault in Missouri. \n\nThere is also a fault zone along the Wabash River, on the eastern side of Illinois that occasionally has small earthquakes. \n\nIf you want to see some other maps similar to the one above go here:\nhttp://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/hazmaps/products_data/2002/ceus2002.php\n\nI'm a geologist (from southern Illinois)."

"2","i want to know the reason for bend test failure?","i need to know what test could be carried out to check the reason for bend test failure , the bend test failure occured on the FL of the weld and i need to know the actual reason by any test","If the failure occured on the weld, then chances are the weld was not of high quality, or the piece was poorly designed.  Take a cross section of the part at the failure point, and look at the mechanism of the fracture.  Compare what you find to pictures of known failures (brittle failure, crack propogation, etc).  This will show you how it failed, then you should be able to determine the reason for the failure, being that you have the loading data.  If the weld was good, but the break still occured here, it could be because of stress concentrations that were induced because of a poorly designed part.  To give you a better answer, I would need more specific information about the broken part, the load applied, and the material involved."

"2","What are limestone caves?Where are they found and how are they formed?","","Limestone caves are formed by erosion.  Rainwater is slightly acidic and this erodes limestone.  Can start off as rock eroding from a small underground aquifer and can become a large underground river.  The rainwater that percolates through the ground and into the caves erodes the calcium in the limestone.  Where it drips off the roof of the cave, some of the calcite is deposited and this eventually forms a stalicitite.  Where it hits the floor of the cave it becomes a stalicmite.  There are examples of Limestone caves open to the public in Co. Clare and Fermanagh in Ireland although there are many more cave systems in theses areas."
"3","how can i speed up my metabolism?","","Metabolism is the amount of calories your body burns to maintain itself and perform all its functions.\n\nThere are a few techniques to speed it up:\n\n1. Exercise!  When we exercise, our bodies require more energy and our metabolism increases in order to supply it\n\n2. Increase your lean muscle mass by doing weight training.  The addition of muscle mass on an individual will cause an increase in the number of calories that are utilized at rest.\n\n3. Eat regularly just smaller portions.  An ideal diet would be 3 healthy meals with healthy snacks in between.  It's good to take in around 1500-2200 calories a day for women, and 1800-2500 a day for men depending on your Age, Weight, and Energy needs. The idea is to eat frequently to prevent hunger pangs, and to keep your energy levels consistent which in turn will increase and speed up your metabolism."

"1","how do you do an effective lectio divina?","","THE ART of  lectio divina begins with cultivating the ability to listen deeply, to hear “with the ear of our hearts” as St. Benedict encourages us in the Prologue to the Rule. When we read the Scriptures we should try to imitate the prophet Elijah. We should allow ourselves to become women and men who are able to listen for the still, small voice of God (I Kings 19:12); the “faint murmuring sound” which is God's word for us, God's voice touching our hearts. This gentle listening is an “atunement” to the presence of God in that special part of God's creation which is the Scriptures.\n\nTHE CRY of the prophets to ancient Israel was the joy-filled command to “Listen!” “Sh'ma Israel: Hear, O Israel!” In lectio divina we, too, heed that command and turn to the Scriptures, knowing that we must “hear” - listen - to the voice of God, which often speaks very softly. In order to hear someone speaking softly we must learn to be silent. We must learn to love silence. If we are constantly speaking or if we are surrounded with noise, we cannot hear gentle sounds. The practice of lectio divina, therefore, requires that we first quiet down in order to hear God's word to us. This is the first step of lectio divina, appropriately called lectio - reading.\n\nTHE READING or listening which is the first step in lectio divina is very different from the speed reading which modern Christians apply to newspapers, books and even to the Bible. Lectio is reverential listening; listening both in a spirit of silence and of awe. We are listening for the still, small voice of God that will speak to us personally - not loudly, but intimately. In lectio we read slowly, attentively, gently listening to hear a word or phrase that is God's word for us this day."

"1","Why blame Judas? Why blame the Jews?","In the bible, Jesus gave his life for our sins. He knew in advance that he would be crucified, and according to the text it was Gods will that this be done.\n\nIf this is the case, why do we consider Judas a traitor - was he not carrying out God's will?\n\nWhy do so many blame the Jews for the crucifiction when it was God's intention that his son be sacrificed?","For the first part it is simple ...\nThink about this: we are all God's creation and one way or another we carry on God's will. One of the assets given to us is free-will, the will to do as we choose. God's purpose now is to guide us on the right path, but it is us who must walk it. Judas did not know God's will at the time, it was much later that people were aware of what Jesus' death actually ment.\nThe fact that God intended it doesn't excuse Judas' act. It was Judas' choice to betray his teacher and this alone makes his act evil, just like any treason. God doesn't mind-control anyone. He chose to betray Jesus to the romans, thus he is a traitor and his treachery is ten-fold since we are talking about the Son of God (something Judas really believed or he wouldn't be an Apostle).\nAlso the fact that he's a traitor doesn't mean christians should hold a grudge against Judas. After all, he was forgiven for his actions did lead on the right path.\n\nAs for the accusations against the Jews, whatever they had done then, it's all done and it subscribes to the same things I've said above."

This has the effect of slightly increasing your weight at the poles (since you are close to the centre of the Earth and the gravitational force depends on distance) and slightly decreasing it at the equator."

Do they contradict or complement each other?","When the Bible says that God created the rainbow you need to remember that up until the flood, no one ever saw a rainbow because it never rained on the earth until afterward. (The earth was watered by underground springs) God knew that rain was going to cause a refraction of the sunlight, so He ""established"" it as a reminder that He would never again destroy the earth by flood. It may be that at that time, God created the refraction process at the time of the flood. We have never seen or met God. It may just be that when God creates something, the scientific physics are created as well."

"2","On satellites and Newton's law?","How does say the Hubble telescope aim itself?\n\nEvery action creates an opposite reaction blah blah.  I would think that simply using an internal motor to swivel the camera would be fruitless.  \n\nI cannot imagine that thing having sufficient rocket propellant for it to operate for years between services.","The Hubble Telescope uses internal gyros to adjust the direction that it is facing.  The camera and the lens adjust the field of view and the distance of the focus.\n\nThe gyros inside the Hubble Telescope are spinning at a high rate of speed, they are kept spinning by motors, thus creating a lot of angular momentum.  We can't convert angular momentum into horizontal momentum (spindizzy space drive), but we can transfer that momentum to create angular momentum into something else.\n\nBy Newton’s laws of motion a quickly spinning small object can transmit its energy to slowly move a big object.  Once the gyroscopes do that they need to be spun up again.  The gyros stores the energy generated by the electric motors as rotational energy.  With a gyroscope in a vacuum, spinning on a diamond point then it will keep it's energy for a long time; it is rotating in a very low friction environment.  When the motors are put into contact with the gyros, but locked so they can't spin the spinning energy is then transmitted to the rest of the Space Telescope.\n\nWhen the operators, at the Jet Propulsion Center, want to rotate the Hubble Telescope they spin up the gyros with electric motors, then transfer that to the telescope itself.  The movment is very small, which is what the astronomers want.  If they want to make a big turn, then need to use the gyros several times.  Hubble has three gyroscopes on the up-down axis, and three gyroscopes on the port-starboard axis (NASA likes triple redundancy).  Four of those gyroscopes are not working anymore.\n\nAn internal motor can swing a small telescope, as long as it is mounted on a large object.  In this case the momentum generated by swinging the small telescope is transferred to the large object where it will have less effect, it may not even have enough effect to over power the objects inertia and so the large object remains in place.  This is the opposite of what happens in the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nYou are correct that it would be futile to try and spin a large object with a small motor more energy is required.  According to Newton’s Laws objects at rest tend to stay at rest, so you have to overcome inertia to get an object moving.  A motor doesn’t have enough energy to do that.  It takes a gyroscope with more energy imparted to it to overcome the inertia.  If the Hubble Telescope used motors to turn itself then these motors would just turn slowly until they burned out.  The movement that they would impart would be very small.  A gyroscope is repeatedly spun up to faster and faster speeds.  Its large energy is stored, ready to transmit it to the telescope.\n\nThe rockets on the Hubble are only used for position keeping and gross movement.  Their fuel is limited so they can't do this often.  The gyros are powered by electric motors using the power generated, by the sun, inside the solar cells.  To keep this power flow even, and to insure that there is enough power to operate things like the gyroscopes batteries are used.\n\nWhen an astronaut uses an electric screwdriver in space the small motor creates a high angular momentum.  The station is too large (has too much inertia) to be turned with the screwdriver so it spins the astronaut.  Special gearing and balancing, inside the screwdriver, is needed to prevent this.  If the astronaut tries to spin the screwdriver by hand then they are doing the same thing.  The resistance to the screw caused by the hull of the space station is strong enough to send the rotational energy right back into the astronaut.  The astronaut doesn’t have the ability to brace against the earth and use its inertia to stop them from rotating.  If the astronaut is in a braced position then they can use the inertia of the Space Station to prevent them from rotating, but this isn’t always a good position to work from.  The Hubble has a lot less mass and the gyros are positioned to work on one axis so it uses the energy more efficiently.  Movin"

"1","Is there really God?If is how many?If one God,how come there is a lot of different religion in the world?","I've been wondering this question since I little.I ask my parents but they couldn't answer that question too,they only answered,believe in what you believe now.And my catholic teacher told me that,there is really God,if not how the world and human be created?What is your opinion about the question above?","Do you really think anyone on Yahoo Answers has the answer to what many philosphers have been trying to figure out for thousands of years? Ehh... I'll try.\n\nI have spent countless nights trying to get some sort of answer myself. It's really hard for me accept that there is a God though. Either that, or it's hard for me to accept the God that my parents tried to drill into to my head since I was a baby. (They are fundamentalist Christians by the way. the outrageous ideas make me sad that there are more people out there like them.)\n\nI think there might a God because it seems very unlikely that such a complex life could have happened by accident, or by an explosion of matter. The way that DNA is constructed, cells, and just the way that the human body functions seems all too perfect for it to happen by some random chance. \n\nHowever, I as I said before, I don't know if I could ever believe in the Catholic or Christian God. Supposedly, God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. That means he is all-good, all-knowing, and all-powerful. I'm sure that you are well aware of the sorrow, suffering and pain that a billion people feel every day due to war,starvation, genocide, poverty, and most importantly evil. If God was all-good, he would not allow this to happen. If God is all-good, but he can't stop it, that means he is not all-powerful. If said God is not all-powerul, then he cannot be God. \n\nGod cannot be omnicent or all-knowing, because humans have free will, and those two are contridictory. One might argue that everything needs a creator. Even the Universe. Something cannot create itself. So God created the universe, but who or what created God? \n\nPerhaps there is a God, but it is likely that all of those rules, and dogmatic views that Christians teach is not accurate. The texts of the Bible have been PROVEN to be altered by numerous kings, who put into it what they wanted. Similar to how George W. Bush is running the country based on his morals. I don't know, you decide.\n\n The answer will probably never be solved, and people will always be kept wondering. I believe in God, but I don't believe in organized religion.\n\nRead this, you would find it interesting. It's a converstaion between an ordinary man and God.

I drive  a new Land rover, I have plently of money and have a large loving family of whom I am always surrounded by. All that said, I find it difficult to even get out of bed in a morning. I feel so depressed most of the time. I'm sure it is affecting things between me and my girlfriend. I've been to the doctors before and he has said it is not a problem that requires medication, just relax. It's gotton to the point now that I really don't see any way out.","I'll tell you the problem. It's your age. It is fairly well known that people all over the world get a little depressed at this age.\nTry a foreign holiday. Without anyone. Summertime is good, go now. Flying is exciting - and cheap. Try areas that you can speak the language fluently. Get as much beer as possible ( spirits may harm ). Travel light; take minimum - in most countries laundrettes are plentiful. Take change of footware. Write  home. Telephone only when happy. Talk to as many girls as makes you happy. Ignore all males - they are not natural nurses.\nJoin in what you are good at only when happy. Eat less, drink more. Do not worry about spending too much. Take all forms of obtaining money. Walk more. Think of evil things to do to your enemies. Put those off until they are legal. Do not insult the locals. Smile more. Be glad you are not working. A month works for me. Grit your teeth - it's everybody else that's the problem."

What should I expect?","Long-term issues include damage to the brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and just about everything else. (1)  However, there's still hope for a return to physical normality - one study suggests that the brain can heal itself from damage due to meth if given enough time. (2)  Similar non-drug-related studies point to regenerative properties for the heart even after a heart attack (3), as well as the lungs and other organs after cessation of smoking tobacco. (4)  So yes, there is hope.\n\nMore importantly, regardless of your physical health there is always an opportunity for reconciliation and forgiveness from God.  Jesus loves all of us, and he bore the penalty of our sins upon the cross to open the doors of God's Kingdom to anyone who professes genuine faith.  It's the broken sinners who acknowledge their flaws, not the self-righteous blowhards who feign perfection, that Jesus came to save.  Centers like Teen Challenge (which is hardly just for teens) offer an option for physical and spiritual treatment.

"3","What is anaphylaxis? What causes anaphylaxis?","","Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction due to a Type I Hypersensitivity reaction.  In this type of reaction, exposure to an allergen triggers mast cells to release large amounts of histamine.  This can cause shock and suffocation due to the closure of the airway, among other symptoms.  Diphenhydramine (Benedryl) can be used to treat anaphylactic shock.  Oral diphenhydramine is usually not fast-acting enough, so an injection is given.  Epinephrine can also be injected to counteract the affects of shock, maintaining blood flow to the body and opening the airways (via Beta-2 adrenergic stimulation to the airways)."

Took a pregnancy test a couple days ago and said im not pregnant. tho i havent gotten my period yet (didnt finish pack of bc yet) so do i have anything to worry about? Or did the bc just put off my period for a little while?","The morning after pill can affect the date of your next period. It is recommended that a pregnancy test be done if you have not had your period within 21 days.\n\nAs you have already done this it is doubtful that you are pregnant, pregnancy test are fairly accurate.\n\nIt is possible that your problem is due to starting BC 2 days after the incident. It is generally recommended that you start BC after your next period. It is also possible that stress and worry are a factor as suggested in a previous answer.\n\nI would suggest you wait a further week, if still nothing take a further pregnancy test and if still negative check with your doctor."

"3","How do help young children coup with a mentily ill parent?","","The easiest way is to get them in therapy. Children need to understand that what is wrong with their parents is not their fault and they are not responsible for their parents. The parent is the adult, not the child and sometimes the children of mentally ill parents have problems making that distinction. The trick is to put them in a group situation with other children going through the same thing that they are. The priority though is to always be honest with the child. Children can handle the truth. More often then not, when a child is lied to, they grow up to resent the lies and resent the parents or adults that lied to them."

She suffered for a much longer time than I would have put up with it.\n\nFinally they removed one ovary and scraped everything. She was told to have a child immediately or she would never have one. She got pregnant and had a healthy baby. Long story short, the cysts kept returning. Her life was not worth living and she was living on pain pills.\n\nThey didn't want to do a hysterectomy because she was 32 years old. They just kept going in and removing them when the pain was bad. FINALLY I went to the doctor and raised hell with him. We ended up having his female partner do the hysterectomy. He just couldn't do it. He didn't care how she felt, just how old she was. She had everything removed. She said (afterwards) she didn't realize how terrible she hurt until the surgery. She is in great health now, no more pain. She takes a pill daily for menopause."

"2","why do i have red eye in pictures?","","Red-eye is a phenomenon that happens only when taking photos using a flash. When taking photos in day light or when in high ambient light scenarios people’s eyes look normal. When taking pictures in low ambient light scenarios using a flash the result many times is redness in the people’s eyes.\n\nThe reason for the color red is simple – when flash light from the camera hits the eyes it penetrates and is reflected back from the retina. The color of the reflected light is red because the light is actually reflected from the red blood in the retina.\n\n(To read more, click the link below.)"

In 4–5 billion years, it will enter a red giant phase, its outer layers expanding as the hydrogen fuel in the core is consumed and the core contracts and heats up. Helium fusion will begin when the core temperature reaches about 3×108 K. While it is likely that the expansion of the outer layers of the Sun will reach the current position of Earth's orbit. Recent research suggests that mass lost from the Sun earlier in its red giant phase will cause the Earth's orbit to move further out, preventing it from being engulfed. Following the red giant phase, intense thermal pulsations will cause the Sun to throw off its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula. The Sun will then evolve into a white dwarf, slowly cooling over eons. At this stage the solar luminosity will be insufficient to support life on Earth."

""We couldn't see a uterus around the baby.""\n\nEmylea developed outside of the womb when a fertilized egg fell into her mother's abdominal cavity. The placenta that feeds the baby was planted outside of the uterus. \n\nThe baby was delivered during emergency surgery with minor disabilities.\n\n""She's the most beautiful child I could ever dream of having,"" said Emylea's mother, Lia Tharby. \n\nThe successful pregnancy without a womb raises questions as to whether a man could one day become pregnant.\n\n""Good Morning America"" medical contributor, Dr. David Katz, weighed in on the debate. He said men would need the female hormones necessary to sustain a pregnancy.\n\n""Could it be done? Yes,"" Katz said. ""But there would be unpleasant side effects for a guy. I wouldn't rush off to try that."""

I feel it when I wipe after going to the bathroom.  \n\nIt is uncomfortable during sex so I take it out before we start and put it back in right after.  This is less than 3 hours so it seems safe. \n\nHow can I tell if I have it in right?","Funny....I have been on the Nuvaring for 4 weeks now and just yesterday decided to take it out and try a different contraceptive.\n\nI had the same problem.  I could feel mine also.  My Dr told me to take a tampon applicator and push the ring up with that.  I tried that and it didnt work.  I tried pushing it up as far as I could with my own finger and still didnt work.  My husband and I had sex and when we finished it came out with him!  He said he felt like the game at the carnival with the pop bottle and the rings!  LOL  sorry had to throw that in....was too funny.\n\nAnyways, I also started to get other side effects.  Such as:\n\n*piercing headaches that Advil couldnt take away\n*sudden chills\n*emotional rollercoaster (like deppression)\n*pregnancy symptoms\n*nauseau\n*low low sex drive (which is unusual for me)\n*sharp chest pains\n\nIt was really really weried, because some of these side effects came at different times and I never put two and two together until I got on the intertnet and I started to research more on the Nuvaring.\n\nI found a helpful site where other ladies who have or who are using the ring have sent in messages to a message board.  \n\nOh yeah, and it also kept feeling like a baby kicking in my lower stomach area.  I also found out that it is another side effect.  Its called ""foreign body sensation"".  Weried, eh?  \n\nI was bummed because I really wanted the Nuvaring to work for me.\n\nI also read that if the ring keeps falling out and you can physical feel it when you wipe than you might have a prolapsed (drooped) uterus.  And they say you may have to try a different form of b.c.\n\nWell, good luck!"

I'll try to give an explanation: forgive me if I go over anything you already know. Alright, think of it this way: you know how to multiply fractions, correct? Alright, so when you multiply two fractions, such as 1/2 and 3/4, you multiply the numerators (those are on the top) (1x3) and the denominators (those are on the bottom) (2x4) and you have your answer: 1/2 x 3/4 = (1x3)/(2x4) = 3/8. Dividing is just the opposite of multiplication. So if you were dividing 1/2 by 3/4, you just flip over the second fraction and multiply: 1/2 / 3/4 = 1/2 x 4/3 = 4/6. \nHere's an answer that's a bit more advanced but might help you understand this better (at least it did for me): if you have some number, a, over some number, b, it can be written this way: a/b. Now, if you divide it by some other fraction, c/d, it can be written this way: \na/b x 1/(c/d). This is the same as saying that when you divide 6/1 by, say, 2 (which equals the fraction 2/1), it is the same as if you are multiplying 6/1 (6/1, or six divided by 1, equals 6) by 1/2. See for yourself: 6 / 2=3, 6 x 1/2= 6/1 x 1/2 = 6/2 which when you reduce (divide top and bottom by common factor, in this case 2) it equals 3/1, or 3. \n1/(c/d) is the reciprocal of (c/d). The reciprocal basically means you flip the top and bottom: for instance, the reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2, the reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1, or 2, the reciprocal of 4/1, or 4, is 1/4, etc. So if you flip over c/d, you get: a/b x d/c, which if a=1, b=2, c=3, and d=4, is exactly the same as what we had above."

"2","what happens when fuel is burned?","","You didn't specify the fuel but in general burning is a chemical reaction with oxygen or an oxidation process.  This process releases energy in some form.  Heat is one of those forms, mechanical motion, and light are others.\n\nThere is no requirement for carbon in the process of burning fuel as is stated by some other answerer's.  Let's, for example, consider burning hydrogen.  The hydrogen combines with the oxygen (oxidizes) which releases energy in the form of heat.  The Hindenburg disaster had very little carbon in its primary burn.\n\nSince this combining of 2 or more elements seems to be a requirement for burning (at least one of them being oxygen) it is possible to un-combine them by adding energy to revert to the initial elements.  Again for simplicity, let's use hydrogen and oxygen [so abundant on this planet].  When the hydrogen and oxygen are burned in proper balanced proportions (two atoms of hydrogen to one oxygen in stoichiometric proportions) there is only water and energy.  The energy we use to move things, light things, heat things, etc.  The water in this case is waste.  You can perform electrolysis on the water and separate the O2 and H2. You can then burn them again releasing the energy that you put back into the separation through electrolysis.  This is just un-burning the hydrogen and oxygen by adding energy.\n\nTypically one thinks of burning as a non-reversable process but only when you're talking about proteins...like un-frying an egg.  \n\nA string of hydrocarbons burned with ""air"" is also more complicated because we're using a large percentage of nitrogen along with our oxygen.  The ratio is roughly 80/20 Nitrogen to Oxygen. To maintain the balance of equations (that stoichiometric word) we'd be working with nitrogen oxides (burned nitrogen) like nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide and many carbon by-products like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.\n\nAll in all it's a big mess.\n\nI hope that fully answered your question."

"3","What is the average penis size?","","5-7"" when erect, regardless of race.\n\nYour penis is like an artist’s paintbrush.  It’s not how long it is that matters.  It’s how skillfully you use it and how many different brush strokes you know.\n\nThese penis size questions come up again and again on this site.  Women almost always say it doesn’t matter to them.  And if it actually does matter to a small minority of women, so what?  There are still plenty left who don’t think it’s very important.  \n\nWhat’s far more important is whether you’re skilled at using your penis to satisfy your woman.  Can you last as long as you want?  Can you vary the depth of your strokes, the pace of them, the angle of them, so that you can offer your woman a little teasing and unpredictability at times?  Are you skilled enough at other ways to pleasure her, so that penis-vagina intercourse is only one of the things on the menu you offer her?  \n\nEven if you can’t do all of these things at present, these are all things you can LEARN to do.  But you can’t learn to have a bigger penis.\n\nAnd let’s not forget, it’s usually the person attached to the penis that decides whether a woman finds you appealing or not.  You could be hung like a horse, but if you’re an inconsiderate jerk you still won’t be very attractive to women."

Anyone that thinks it is a choice is obviously mentally challenged. No one would choose to be ridiculed, beaten, or even killed just so they can have sex with the same gender. Do you think gay men sit around thinking, ""Gee, I'll go pack some fudge just to piss off my preacher?"" The medical and psychiatric communities have already figured out that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. It is not a condition, disease, or ailment and therefore cannot be cured, treated, vilified. These so called ex-gay religious groups fooling themselves. A person can choose who or what gender they engage in sex with, but they cannot choose who they are attracted to. These ex-gay converts are simply kissing the churches butt and being led like lemmings to the desired brainwashing outcome. It is no different than when gays have sex with the opposite gender to make mommie or daddie or the preacher man happy, although they are miserable."

"1","Nicolatians believe.....?","In the bible.","The doctrine of the Nicolaitans was mentioned in the Apocalypse of John to the churches of Pergamos and Ephesus of the seven churches of Asia in Revelation 2. It was a symbolic name of a party that represents the hierarchy of a ruling class over the rest of the people, developing a ""pecking order"" of fleshly leadership. Jesus hated this and warns the people to repent or else ""I will come upon you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth."" The same warning illustration is applied to those that abused grace, which led to licentiousness from the example of Balaam, seducing Christians to fornication and tampering with idolatry. The individual overcomer is allowed to eat of the hidden manna and given a white stone with a new name written in it.\nThe Early church father Iranaeus, identified the Nicolaitans in his treatise ""Against Heresies"" in the second century as they who are an ""offshoot of the knowledge which is falsely so-called,"" mentioning that they ""lead lives of unrestrained indulgence."" There is no absolute proof that the heretic Nicolas was the Deacon of the same name from Antioch of the seven deacons in the book of Acts, but Iranaeus supposed him to be so. Ignatius mentions the Nicolaitans also, so there was in fact a heretical group existing at that time. Nicolas the deacon was perhaps confused with another Nicolas, the bishop Nicolas of Samaria who was a heretic in the company of Simon Magus.\n\nThe root of the word Nicolaitans comes from Greek nikao, to conquer or overcome, and laos, which means people and which the word laity comes from. The two words together especially means the destruction of the people and refers to the earliest form of what we call a priestly order or clergy which later on in church history divided people and allowed for leadership other than those led by the spirit of the risen Lord Jesus Christ. A good translation of Nicolaitan would be ""those who prevail over the people."" This clerical system later developed into the papal hierarchy of priests and clergy lording over the flock. The Council of Trent stated, ""If anyone shall say that there is not in the Catholic Church a hierarchy established by the divine ordination, consisting of bishops, presbyters and ministers, let him be anathema."" It is not the question of the ministries but rather in the separation of them into a hierarchy over the people. This very idea was taken over by the Protestants with their own corruption of leadership roles and coverings. The Church of Ephesus was commended for hating the deeds of the Nicolaitans. The wrong separation of the clergy from the laity is a great evil in God's sight and He hates the lust for religious power. There is an ungodly spiritual authority in the Church today, which is nothing more than the prideful spirit of control, manipulation, domination and intimidation and a rebellion of the rightful authority of God.\n\nFaithful believers who have put on Christ Jesus, are all God's laity. Peter exhorted us to \n\nFeed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind. Neither as being lords over God's heritage but being examples to the flock. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.\nShepherds serve the sheep but the wolves that clothe themselves with so-called leadership and spiritual authority serve themselves, thinking that they serve God. In essence, this makes them false christs. Early church leaders were established as overseers, not a ruling hierarchy."

There are a few things you can look for and use for a pretty accurate self-diagnosis (and I'm sure it goes without saying that you should see a doctor, even though most doctors don't know what they are talking about when it comes to Candida). The first test is kind of gross; but if you spit into a glass of water, and you see the saliva traveling down the water to the bottom of the glass in spears, that is an indication of Candida present in the Saliva. Another symptom are fungal nails, and most of the time people who have Candida's breath will turn sour immediately after eating something sweet. \nI hope these help. Candida can be overcome pretty easily if you cut out simple carbohydrates, sugar and dairy, and take some pro-biotics like Acidophilus. You can also eat plain yogurt; it contains helpful pro-biotics that can set your stomach chemistry right again."

"2","Can you explain …whats acceleration due to gravity in simple terms with examples….I did not understand reading","","We will consider motion along a straight line as it is simple. As observed by us we can divide the motion into two categories. Motion with same speed and motion with changing speed. Speed changing is acceleration (this is what happens when the accelerator of a car is pressed). Acceleration is measured by how much speed changes in one second. Acceleration of a body is due to force applied on the body(higher the force higher is the acceleration).  When a body is falling its speed is changing at the rate of about ten metres per second per second. ie in every second the speed changes by 10m/s. If a body is dropped its initial speed is zero. After one second its speed will be 10m/s and after another second its speed will be 20m/s and so on. And this speed changing rate (acceleration) is constant for all bodies(big, small, hot ,cold etc). This speed changing (acceleration) is there because of the force due to earth which pulls everybody towards its centre. The exact value is 9.8m/s/s(varies slightly from place to place).  This speed changing rate or acceleration caused due to earth's pull is acceleration due to gravity. Acceleration due to gravity on the moon is less and acceleration due to gravity on Jupiter is more than that on earth."

The glucose level and protein level was normal. A Gram stain was negative for bacteria. Cerebrospinal fluid viral culture proved positive for an enterovirus.","The spinal fluid is useful but you left out WBC with diff. I would suggest an encephalitis of viral origins and since you didn't include history of patient, certain encephalitic infections are carried by various species of mosquitoes, it is possibly Japan B encephalitis, that is why history of the patient is vital....enterovirus are quite common and can cause meningitis without sequela...usually! If you are presenting, a AP/Lateral would be useful. Your description of 'extreme irritability' is vague...to sound, to touch, or restlessness. Emesis is common in infants but is it continuous, intermittent, after feeding? Nucchal rigidity is more important in older patients where the muscles have have time to strengthen but are no so diagnostic with infants. If indeed the diagnosis is encephalitis of enterovirus origin, since enterovirus are the second most common virus in many areas, it would be difficult to guess...but you need the history."

"2","Why do atoms join or react?","","The answer is simple. All elements (whose basic units are atoms) except the noble gases, have less than 8 electrons in their valence shells.  The rule that states that atoms should have 8 electrons to achieve stability is called The Octet Rule.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_rule\n\nThe way that they can attain 8 electrons is by forming BONDS: by either sharing electrons (covalent bond) or by gaining/losing electrons (ionic bond).   This is the main reason why atoms react: to attain 8 valence electrons.\n\nIf we look at it at another angle, we can say that atoms react in order to decrease energy.  This comes from the principle that bond formation results in loss of energy, and that stability comes from decreased energy.\n\nHope that helps."

Easter isn't about easter baskets and bunny rabbits that hop giving eggs and treats to kids and so forth. So when did the easter bunny become the spokes person for Easter instead of the real reason why we celebrate it... Jesus Christ?","EASTER A BRIEF HISTORY\n\nThe name “Easter” comes to America from Ostera or Eostre, the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring. The origin goes back to 2000 BC in Babylonia honoring the goddess of spring Ishtar. Ishtar the mother/wife of their god Tammuz brought him back from the underworld. In Phoenecia she became Astarte, in Greece Eostre, and in Germany Ostara. Consider also a Phrygian honoring Attis and Cybele or a heretic Israelite honoring the Canaanite Baal and Ashtoreth. All of these are fertility celebrations of death and resurrection.\n\nEASTER IN THE KING JAMES\n\nThe word “Easter” occurs in the King James Bible ONE TIME and is mistranslated. It should be translated PASSOVER.\n\nActs 12:4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. \n\nEaster G3957 pascha (pas'-khah) Of Chaldee origin (compare [H6453]); the Passover (the meal, the day, the festival or the special sacrifices connected with it): - Easter, Passover.\n\nH6453  pesach (peh'-sakh) From H6452; a pretermission, that is, exemption; used only technically of the Jewish Passover (the festival or the victim): - passover (offering).\n\nH6452 pasach (paw-sakh') A primitive root; to hop, that is, (figuratively) skip over (or spare); by implication to hesitate; also (literally) to limp, to dance: - halt, become lame, leap, pass over.\n\nTHE ORIGINAL PASSOVER A SHADOW\n\nExo.12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. Exo.12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. Exo.12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as He hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. Exo.12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? Exo.12:27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. \n\nWhat did it say in Exo.12:26? What mean ye by this service?\n\nWhat did it say in Exo.12:27? It is the SACRIFICE of the LORD'S Passover.\n\nThis was a shadow, that is a silhouette or likeness, of Christ’s crucifixion. Israel was in bondage to the Egyptians. We were in bondage to sin.\n\nCHRIST OUR PASSOVER\n\nI Cor.5:6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? I Cor.5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us: I Cor.5:8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. \n\nChrist our Passover is SACRIFICED for us.\n\nIT IS PROBABLY TRULY DISGUSTING TO FATHER \n\nAs with most Christian holidays, Easter has been secularized and commercialized. We have Easter bunnies, eggs, baskets, bonnets, parades and etc. \n\nKnowing now the origins of Easter, the fallacy of Easter and the sacrifice Christ made for us; I am truly ashamed of myself. We should not be celebrating Easter. We should be celebrating Christ our Passover with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. \n\nWhat is your answer to a child who asks, “What mean ye by this service?” I pray your answer is not Easter.\n\nWhat does God think, about what He sees and hears during this special time of year?"

"3","Am I actually fat?","I'm 16 and 1/2 yrs old, I am 5'5 and weigh about 134lbs... Is that normal? All my friends say I look normal, but I think 134lbs is too much for someone my height... I've struggled a bit with eating disorders in the past, so I'm not entirely sure that I can trust my opinion, but I'm also worried my friends are just trying not to hurt my feelings...\nWhen I look at myself, I see a girl who could definately lose 20-30 pounds and then I'd be an acceptable weight...","The way that doctors and other medical professionals determine if someone is a healthy weight is the Body Mass Index (BMI). Given your weight and height you have a BMI of 22.3. This number falls in the range of a healthy weight. Losing 20-30 pounds would put you into an underweight and unhealthy range. Losing 10-15 pounds would keep you in the range of a healthy weight, but it puts you very close to being underweight. I wouldn't suggest it. Your current weight is perfect for your height and will ensure that you are happier and healthier."

It happens when you don't have enough room in your mouth for the tooth to push through and it presses against your back teeth and puts pressure on your jaw.  It is very painful.  At the dentist they will have to take an xray to see if this is the case.  If you do have this going on they may have to cut them out, but don't worry they will give you a local anesthetic or maybe even sedate you completely before doing so."

On the outer side of the basement concrete, you must place water-proofing sheet before cementing them. However, since the water will give huge pressure to the basement, you have to divert the force by either using  submersible pump(s) to pump out the water automatically when it reaches certain level, or make drain(s) to the lower level, for example to the river down hill, if the situation is suitable."

"3","Is running 5 miles a day to lose weight enough?","I'm 25/female/london and I'm 5'5 and I weigh 155lbs...and I'd like to lose 30lbs....","You will eventually lose weight by running 5 miles each day.  It will also depend very much on what food you take in of course.  You will not lose weight if your intake of food increases, due to more exercise.  However, the problem with weight loss is that you expect it to be so instant.  If you run 5 miles every day for a whole week you feel you are really getting on top of the problem.  Not so.  You will probably put on weight.  Your legs are toning with muscle and also your tummy is tightening.  Do not expect to begin to actually lose weight until well into the second month, if not later.  Eventually though you will not only lose weight but also tone all of your muscles.  Running is extremely effective in the long term, as is walking.  The thing is if you don't run but walk you must walk hills.  This strenghens the leg muscles and tones you even more.  I would advocate long hill walks, this tones the legs and inner thighs.  You will lose weight, just stick at it.  Do not expect instant results.  Its a long term, life style changing exercise.  Good luck, I wish you well."

Last night, it was really inquisitive and was much closer to me and at one point I felt it was actually inches from my face. I felt it leave the room several times and I believe it went to my 12 month old sons room before returning to me. \nI told it to go to the light repeatedly but it wouldn't go. I asked it what message it was trying to give me, but recieved no answer.\nI don't feel that it is a negative(evil if you prefer) entity. I believe it is just very inquisitive. The thing is, I am quite scared of it, even though I know this is irrational and I haven't had a good nights sleep for two nights running.\nWHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS FOR GETTING IT TO CONVEY ITS MESSAGE IF IT HAS ONE OR TO LEAVE??","If this is the first time you have experienced something like this it can be quite scary. Mostly these apparitions are completely harmless, maybe a recently passed family member or friend or someone who you have not met that is simply lost or connected to your home in some way. To sense something is one thing but to actually see it is another. Different religions offer different remedies and I myself have tried a few with some sucess but never attempted to dispell a spirit unless it was obvious that it wanted to do someone harm. You should call some good friends that you trust in your support cirlce and do some research . Conduct yourself as the host and not the victim. This may very well resolve itself on its own.

A syndicate won quite a few million, l think about 10 employees got about £500'000 each at a local supermarket. But they haven't left their jobs because they feel the company have been good to them and have worked there for donkeys years.

"2","Which method, gravimetric analysis or volumetric analysis is more reliable and why?","I am looking at these methods used to determine metal content in a solution.","The previous responder brings up excellent points, particularly about the method relying on how good the analyst is.  This is highly true!   However I would add, that gravimetric methods are typically more ACCURATE for the following reasons:\n\n1.  Errors associated with volume measurement (loss in transfer, parallax, spillage, over-titration, etc.) are reduced in gravimetric measurements.  In most gravimetric measurements, you WEIGH a final product, which either IS the compound of interest, or is stoichiometrically related to it.\n\n2.  Gravimetric methods are less sensitive to temperature than volumetric methods.\n\n3.  While BOTH types of methods are subject to sample loss, gravimetic methods are less so.  (Note:  This is less true if the analyst is a clutz.   Goes very well with the previous poster's comment!)\n\n4.  A mass is easier to reproducibly determine than a concentration.   (Any day of the week!)\n\n5.  A mass is easier to STANDARDIZE than a concentration.  Again there are errors associated with both, we concede, but mass is generally easier to deal with.  \n\n6.  You will more likely encounter limits (of sensitivity) in volume measurements than you will in  mass measurements, depending on how your lab is equipped.  \n\nThese are a few thoughts, I'm sure there are others."

"2","explain how acids & bases act as buffers?","","Acidity is when an excess of H+ binds H2O as H3O+.  Strong acids are ones like HCl, which in solution will ionize completely--Cl-, being very soluble, will let go of H+ to make the solution acidic.  Other ""weak"" bases are ones that do not necessarily ionize completely.  Excess H+ will bind to sites in the weak acid molecule rather than binding to H20, meaning that the pH will not be as low (low pH < 7 = acidic).  In this way, a weak acid can act as a buffer--in pure water, it will ionize to a certain extent, but with excess H+, it will bind more H+, but the free H+ in solution will only change very little, and the pH remains rather stable."

"3","What do you think of Goji juice?","","Although I have not tried the juice personally, I do eat the actual berries and have done a great deal of research on goji products (I do not sell them!). I chose to eat the berries because they contain essential fatty acids in the seeds, which the juice does not include, and I have actually begun to grow my own goji plants. \n\nIt is true, the hype around goji juice is way over the top, but it is also true that there is a heck of a lot of research backing the berries as very useful natural anti-aging supplements. Probably the main reasons they are touted as having anti-cancer benefits are: there are several studies demonstrating that a component of the berries, the  polysaccharides, have anti-cancer properties and numerous other anti-aging benefits, and the ORAC score (a measure of antioxidants, which are well-known anti-cancer and anti-aging agents) of goji berries is quite high, at around 25,300 (some sources say over 30,000). The thing with the highest ORAC score that we eat traditionally is black raspberries, with a score of 7,700. Next, we have prunes at 5,770, bilberry at 4,460 and pomegranates at 3,307. These are all still very high scores, and it is important to get antioxidants from a variety of sources, as there are different types in different foods. \n\nI could go on about the nutrient and vitamin levels, but don't want to sound too overboard (they are ridiculously nutritious). I believe these fruit should be grown wherever possible (can be grown down to zone 6), and that people should be growing them themselves. The price of the juice is just too much for many people, so I recommend this option, or at least finding a good supply of organic berries instead. Bottom line: goji juice or goji berries may help with certain health conditions (as will eating any healthy food), but if you want to be healthy, you have to eat other healthy foods as well, including many other fruits and vegetables, and stay active!"

"2","Zoloft Overdosing?","Does anyone know about overdosing on Zoloft?","Among 634 overdoses in which sertraline hydrochloride was the only drug ingested, 8 resulted in fatal outcome, 75 completely recovered, and 27 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage to include alopecia, decreased libido, diarrhea, ejaculation disorder, fatigue, insomnia, somnolence and serotonin syndrome. The remaining 524 cases had an unknown outcome. The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal sertraline hydrochloride overdosage were somnolence, vomiting, tachycardia, nausea, dizziness, agitation and tremor. \n\nThe largest known ingestion was 13.5 grams in a patient who took sertraline hydrochloride alone and subsequently recovered. However, another patient who took 2.5 grams of sertraline hydrochloride alone experienced a fatal outcome. \n\nOther important adverse events reported with sertraline hydrochloride overdose (single or multiple drugs) include bradycardia, bundle branch block, coma, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations, hypertension, hypotension, manic reaction, pancreatitis, QT-interval prolongation, serotonin syndrome, stupor and syncope. \n\nOverdose Management -Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant. \n\nEnsure an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. \n\nActivated charcoal should be administered. Due to large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for sertraline are known. \n\nIn managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center on the treatment of any overdose.

"3","Does the concept of negative calories really work?","I was talking with a friend about dieting, and she told me that certain foods burn more calories (energy) to be digested than they add to your body, thus creating a negative calorie effect.  What I mean is, these foods don't add calories, they actually use calories to be able to be digested, but make you feel full at the same time. Has anyone tried a diet based on negative calorie foods, and was it effective?","There actually is a diet called the Negative Calorie Diet and believe it or not, it does work - sort of. I have an article on my website about this diet and why you don't want to follow it even though it works to a degree. I've provided the link to the article below. \n\nThe Negative Calorie Diet is based on the idea that some foods cause you to burn more calories digesting these foods than the actual calorie content of the food itself. \n\nIt's true that some foods raise your metabolic rate more than others do. Carbohydrate and protein, for example, contain about four calories per gram. But, the thermic effect of protein is far greater than that of carbohydrate. \n\nIn other words, some of the energy in each gram of protein is wasted as heat during the process of digestion and metabolism. While all this sounds great, here is the downfall of this diet.\n\nIf you rely on this diet alone, you will probably lose a little weight but it won't last long. The reason is because most of the weight you'll lose will be water and muscle - not fat (which is what you want to lose). The bottom line is this diet is just another ""fad diet"" that you should stay away from if you are looking for long term weight loss. \n\nTravis"

"3","shallow breathing?","since the dr has put up my dads morphine he hasnt been on his oxygen even though he has cynosis, the pulmonary edema has reached his lungs, his breathing is very shallow is their any reason for this","Morphine is a narcotic. Narcotics are pain relievers but the also slow down body processes. Respiration's always decrease with narcotics. It is the biggest concern, when administering narcotics, esp Morphine. Morphine is used intentionally at times to decrease respiration's and decrease body functions to allow the body to heal. Close attention is paid by the Md's and Nurses, to pulse rates and respiratory rates prior and during administration of narcotics. If the respiratory rate or pulse rate is to low, the meds are held. Talk with the doctor and he or she should be able to tell you specifics about the goals and target ranges for your father. I would guess that in this circumstance the MD does intentionally want your father to have decreased breathing and more ease of respiration's along with the goal to increase comfort."
"2","what is H2SO4?","","Sulpuric Acid. If you have heard of 'Acid Rain', this comes down on us around fossil fuel burning plants, which give off SO2 or Suphur Dioxide. When SO2 mixes with the rain water coming down on us, it creates H2SO4 in a diluted form. \n\nH2O + SO2 = H2SO4.\n\nNot harmful to us, but very damaging to buildings. That's why when you see old churches etc the carvings are often worn away.\n\nIn its pure form it is very dangerous and needs transporing by a police escort in a glass tank as it reacts with all other things.\n\nHope this helps."

My gynocologist suggested that I get a hymenectomy to aliviate this problem. However, the prospect of surgery down there is scary to me.

Anything you can tell me would really help! \nThanks!","I haven't had the procedure myself, but a good friend had a hymenectomy at age 16 and said it was a breeze.  In my opinion, it would be much better than having the area rip or tear from sex or a tampon, and it is over in such a short time...not a lifetime of discomfort.  My friend has said she was a little sore right after the outpatient surgery, but mostly just itchy and irritated from the few stitches.  Post-op for her consisted of ice packs for the first day, pain pills as needed (not often), a precautionary round of antibiotics, and some soothing cream for the area as it healed.  It must have worked well, because now 9 years later she's happily married and has a beautiful baby."

I would be convinced if God, with all his infinite power, proved His existence. So why wouldn't He just reveal Himself to people seeking Him? \n\nYou can't really have a relationship with the unproven.\nI keep hearing analogies like if your spouse went away for a week, but you still trust them. Well duh! You already know they exist! Christians, are there any better analogies?","Why doesn't he stand on the side of the road like a billboard?  He does, all of creation testifies to His existance. Study something as simple as a leaf- it's astounding the detail that goes into it.  You seem to like analogies- I do too- so look at it this way: if you see a beautiful Monet, you can admire the brushstrokes, the colors and the composition and no one has to try and convince you that there was an artist!  ""No, no,"" you might say, ""I believe that thousands of years ago all those colors were just thrown into the air and they happened to land on the canvas in this fashion.""  The creation (the painting) testifies to the existance of a painter (the creator)\n\nMatthew 7:7 says if you seek Him you will find Him.  A friend of mine grew up in an orphanage in India and as a small child, wanted to know if there was more to God.  Jesus appeared to Him in a vision and told Him who He was.  Then he began praying for a bible and miraculously enough, some missionaries (this was back in the 1950's- people didn't travel as much as they do today) happened to pass through their small villiage and visit the orphanage so he could have a bible.  He's a missionary now, going to my church and traveling back and forth to India.  \n\nWe have a relationship with God through the Holy Spirit.  It is the Holy Spirit that works on this earth.  I've seen people's deaf ears open. I took a drug dealer to church once, and the power of God there made him start to convulse on the floor- THE NEXT DAY 1.He called all his contacts, 2.quit selling and using drugs and 3. started a street evangelism ministry for the homeless in Houston.  I know God exists because He works in my life- the Holy Spirit can give me a check in my spirit and keep me from going places, and can teach me through revelation. \n\nI have personally prayed for people and God has shown me specific situations in their lives to talk to them about.  One woman I met in a Burger King (she was an employee there) God put it on my heart to pray for her.  As I began to pray I said, ""God let her be a light to Chris."" and she stopped me, took about 3 steps back and wide-eyed asked, ""how did you know my husband's name was Chris?""  Well, I didn't.  I had never met her before; I just prayed what God wanted me to- and He wanted to show her that He knew her, He saw her, He knew her situation and that He cared.  It was pretty cool!\n\n Just yesterday I was reading Psalm 2 about how God fights our battles for us, and I asked Him to do that for me.  Well last night we went to dinner at this restaurant, the food was awful, we were over charged for our meals, but it was such an exhausting day that I didn't feel like fighting our waiter. We still tipped him (since i was a waitress for years) Well the guy comes back with our check copy AND a bag of pasta (the pasta was the large size we'd been charged for, but had not recieved) saying ""the kitchen accidentally made this- you guys want it?""  fresh bread (he hadn't been refilling our bread basket as he should have) and our leftovers.  And my friend, without knowing about my conversation with God that morning said, ""Man, we didn't even have to fight him (the waiter)"" \n\n I know this is an insignificant story, I could tell you more miraculous ones, like how I was woken in the middle of the night to pray for my sister who was busy totaling her car (but walked away with only a small scratch on her knee after clearing a 5' tall fence!) how I was healed of a degenerative family disease, how the power of God has touched my home, but it is the daily testimonies, the small things, that grow our faith. He just wanted me to know yesterday (because of all the battles I'm going through right now) that He cares even for the smallest skirmishes. E-mail me if you want to know more.  I could tell you story after story of the miraculous things God has done.  "

All symbols.\n\nWhen you start using letters as symbolic *placeholders* for numbers, then you've moved up beyond 6th-grade arithmetic and can start using math for more interesting things."
"3","how dangerous is preeclampsia?","","Pre-eclampsia (previously called toxemia) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy.\n\nPre-eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure (two separate readings taken at least 6 hours apart of 140/90 or more) and 300 mg of protein in a 24 hour urine sample (proteinuria). \n\n\nPre-eclampsia is much more common in the first pregnancy (3-5% of births) and usually becomes evident in the third trimester (and virtually always after the 20th week of pregnancy). It is also more common in women who have preexisting hypertension, diabetes, or renal disease, in women with a family history of pre-eclampsia, and in women with a multiple gestation (twins, triplets and more).\n\nPre-eclampsia may also occur in the immediate post-partum period or up to 6-8 weeks post-partum. This is referred to as ""post partum pre-eclampsia"".\n\nCauses\n-----\nPre-eclampsia is thought to be caused by inflammatory mediators secreted by the placenta and acting on the vascular endothelium. If severe, it progresses to fulminant pre-eclampsia, with headaches and visual disturbances, and further to HELLP syndrome and eclampsia. These are life-threatening conditions for both the developing fetus and the mother.\n\nA few nontraditional theories have also been suggested as to the root cause of preeclampsia. Dr. Tom Brewer posits that protein deficiencies can lead to preeclampsia. Other research discovered low homocysteine levels in preeclamptic women, remedied in high-risk patients with folic acid and B6 supplementation."
"1","Imagine that you were not going to go to Heaven because you committed the unpardonable sin?","Would you still try your best to give glory to God and be thankful to Him for the life you have now?  I wonder how many so called Christians would turn their back on Him if they knew they were not going to Heaven.  Shouldn't we look at what we can do to give glory to God rather than just expecting God to do for us?","Jesus mentions a sin that is unforgivable in Matt. 12:31-32 and calls it blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.\n\nNo. A believer cannot commit the unforgivable sin. How can someone who has been born again (John 3:7), made a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17), and received eternal life (John 10:27-28) actually commit the unforgivable sin? He cannot. Jesus Himself said that we have eternal life, not conditional life: ""My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give eternal life to them, and they shall never perish; and no one shall snatch them out of My hand."" Besides, it says in 2 Cor. 5:17 that the Christian is a new creation in Christ. We are different, no longer slaves to the old nature (Rom. 6:14). We are regenerated by the Holy Spirit.\n     There is no biblical support for a believer committing this sin. It just hasn’t happened. Also, if you are worried that you may have committed the sin and can’t be forgiven, then don’t be concerned. If you are worrying about it, then you haven’t committed it. If you are worried about it, then that is a sign that you have not committed it. If you had, you wouldn’t be concerned."

Meanwhile I have taken a day off, drove there, and payed a copay.  Thats another story though.  If this is likely serious, that is nothing to me!  I just am not sure it is or not.  It does feel like it could be some type of muscle injury or maybe even very very severe gas.  I am becoming concerned thought because this is the third day.  The pain is more towards the right side of my body.  Thanks for any advice or suggestions as to the possible cause.","I would say the key to your question is that the pain intensifies with movement. This is usually not indicative of cardiac problems. Have you tried any over the counter meds for pain relief? If it is not relieved with meds I would suggest a trip to the Dr. but it does seem like muscle or back problem."
"2","What is the unsolvable equation?","","Usually, when people talk about solvable equations, they are talking about taking a polynomial and setting it to zero & then finding all of the roots of the equation.\n\nA linear equation (ax+b = 0) is easy to solve.\n\nA quadratic equation (ax^2+bx+c = 0) is not so hard.  You probably learned the quadratic equation in high school.  That formula has been around since the ancient Greeks.\n\nWhat about cubic equations?  (ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = 0)  It turns out that there is a formula that you can use to find the three roots of the equation.  It was discovered in the 1300s by Tartaglia.  It is a very complicated formula.\n\nThe obvious next choice is to see if we can solve fourth degree equations using a formula.  Legendre discovered the formula for this in the late 18th century.\n\nThen a few interesting things happened.  Gauss had already proven that every polynomial with integral coefficients has a solution in the complex numbers.  But in the early 1800s, Nicholas Abel proved that there is no general formula for solving equations of degree five or higher.  Sure -- we know that some can be solved (x^5-32=0 has five roots that can be found, including 2).  But there is no general formula.\n\nA few years later, a young Frenchman named Evariste Galois created a beautiful system that allows us to take any polynomial and through a series of steps tells us exactly which polynomial equations can be solved and which ones cannot be solved.  It took another 50 years for people to find out about his work, because he was killed in a duel before he turned 21.\n\nSo -- if you want to know if an equation is unsolvable, just use Galois' method."

Your heart rate does not need to be high for you to have a high metabolic rate.  Most runners and seasoned athletes have a high metabolism and a very low resting heart rate.\n\nRapid heart rate is not normal at rest in anyone.

"2","Why do automobile wheels look as if the wheels are going backwards when a car is moving forwards?","","For most people, they only look that way under certain conditions: in a movie or video recording, or at night under certain types of lights.\n   This effect is called aliasing, where one does not observe a continuous picture, but lots of snapshots at regular instances of time.  In movies or video, this occurs at the frame rate of the camera.  Under certain lights like Sodium lamps (and incandescents to a lesser degree), their brightness varies with the 50 or 60 HZ frequency of the AC power supplied to them.  This has the effect of also time-sampling the scene, to some degree, just like a strobe light freezes a moving scene. \n    Consider, for example, if the wheel has a regular pattern of spokes, and it is captured in a 30 frame per second movie.  If the speed of the wheel is just right so that the wheel rotates 1 spoke distance in the 1/30th of a second interval between frames, then in each frame the wheel will look the same.  Thus, in the movie, the wheel will appear to be still.  If the wheel speeds up just slightly from this rate, the spokes will appear in each frame just slightly ahead of the last (although you are really looking at a different spoke in each frame), and the wheel will appear to turn forward very slowly.  If the wheel slows down from this rate, the wheel will appear to turn backwards very slowly.\n   This effect is generally not observed in direct sunlight, but the wheel will appear as a continuous blur.  However, because it is a blur, the eye is quite sensititve to even very faint aliasing effects which allow the brain to perceive some stucture there.  Such faint aliasing can come from a variety of unexpected sources, such as the slight increase/decreases in ambient light level as a car drives beside a guardrail with a regular spacing of posts.  Near each post, the light will be slightly brighter or darker from the reflections or shadows of light off the post.  This will give a regular time varying brightness in the car's frame of reference, which may cause a faint aliasing pattern to become visible."
"1","Q about davinci code again....?","what is wrong with the idea that jesus christ was married? is it a sin? does it change him from being jesus christ","No, wouldn't change anything regarding His divinity.  The problem would be in the christians who couldn't accept the fact that He could have been a real man, which He was.  Not a normal man of course, but He was a man in ancient Israel at a time when it would have been extraordinary for any man of His age to have not been married and had kids.  The same principal as the one where Mary was suppose to have been a virgin all her life.  Wouldn't have made sense, especially since He had brothers and sisters, but for some reason, people want to believe that Joseph didn't get the marriage annuled if she'd never sleep with him.  Just kinda silly.\n\nJesus was divine, He rose from the dead and assended into heaven, and the concept that He could have been married and had kids would have nothing to do with that divinity.  I personally don't believe He did marry or have kids, but the idea that He may have would not destroy my faith.  I think a lot of christian's faith relies on what they were taught and they simply can't accept the idea."
"3","What is the difference btwn doing reps of an excerise and just doing as many as you can do at one time?","A lady at the gym saw me working out and told me not to do repititions, she told me that i should decrease the weight and do as many as i could do.  Like instead of doing 4 sets of 15 reps with 50 lbs, she said I should do as many reps as i could do with a lesser amount of weight.  She said the the sets build muscle mass, and the way she was telling me to do it was the way women should do it.  I dont understand, is this true?","I have heard so much stuff just like that in my 12 years of training.  You will hear one person say, do very heavy for 3-4 reps and you will also hear people talking about doing 30 reps like the lady who offered you (probably unsolicited) advice.  In the world of bodybuilding, sometimes the info we get on the street is more valuable that what is in the books.  \n\nI don't really recommend what that lady said.  I would stick with the 15 reps.  If you are going to build muscle, build muscle.  If you are doing cardio, do cardio.  Don't try to combine them. \n\nI truly think after all these years is that it is very important to FEEL the muscle contracting.  This is more important that pushing the weight.  The weight is only a tool to build the muscle, not the final goal.  You are training the muscle not moving the weight.  This is the concept.\n\nI think that with too many reps like 30, it is hard to ""feel"" it."

The Bible also talks of a New Heaven and a New Earth which will come into existence after Jesus returns in glory one day (Revelation 21).  Jesus died for sinners, bearing their guilt (1 Peter 2:24) and all who believe and trust in Him will have eternal life (John 3:16).\n\nJesus said:\n\n""I am the resurrection and the life.

What was man capable of knowing before he ate the fruit? After man ate the fruit what did he experience differently? Why did God forbid the fruit? A test? Maybe we passed and got free reign of our own destiny? Why did man have to leave Eden**** after eating the forbidden fruit, because we purposefully disobeyed God? Was leaving Eden the result of receiving reason? Did we know that that was the punishment? Did God make us aware of the complications of eating the forbidden fruit, or were we too ignorant to understand such a complicated concept? Did we do an “Awwww, Damn!” When we realized what we did, did Adam slap Eve. B-itch! Was the forbidden fruit, sex? Did Adam knock up Eve and gained reason when she missed a month. No wait. That was her punishment – the menstrual cycle and a painful child birth. Why would God give some women a death sentence, then? That’s not a loving god.

God is all things. whoever quoted the I Am scripture got it right.\n\nmale references:\n\n""Along with God as a father, there are other male images for God in the Bible. God is referred to as a shepherd in Psalm 23 and Ezekiel 34 (103). God is referred to as “. . . LORD Most High, the great King over all the earth” in Psalm 47:2 and a judge and king in Psalm 96:10 (103-104). God is portrayed to have great strength and courage. In Psalm 24:8, God is referenced as being a warrior. It says, “Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.”""\n\nfemale references:\n\n""God is also referred to in feminine aspects. In Isaiah 49:15, God is given the characteristics of a nursing mother. Isaiah 66:13, states that “As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem” (104). God is given the characteristics of a midwife in Psalm 22:9-10 and gives birth in Deuteronomy 32:18 and Isaiah 42:14. Characteristics of women by giving birth can also be found in John 3, when God gave his “only begotten son.”""\n\nanimal references:\n\n""God is also equated with animals throughout the Old and New Testaments. In Matthew 23, as well as Luke 13, God is spoken of as a mother hen gathering her chicks under her wings. In Deuteronomy 32 God is referenced to be a mother eagle, and then again a few animal references are made in Hosea 13:7-8. It states, “So I will come upon them like a lion, like a leopard I will lurk by the path. Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them and rip them open. Like a lion I will devour them; a wild animal will tear them apart” (98).""\n\ninanimate object references:\n\n""Throughout the Bible God is also referenced as inanimate objects. In Deuteronomy 4:24, God is “a consuming fire” and in Psalm 84 God is “a sun and shield” (98). In Deuteronomy 32, God is a rock. However, “‘Rock’ applied to God implies a set of qualities, particularly ones that focus on stability and reliability, that rose in the consciousness of the believing community at a particular time” (102).""\n\nit is also important to note that God's name, which is ""’ehyeh ‘asher ‘ehyeh,"" or roughly YHWH is found over 6,000 times in the old testament. it is roughly and most often translated as ""I am (who I am),"" and is a form of ""to be."" due to the fact that jews regarded God's name as sacred and should never have been spoken, they often substituted YHWH with ""Adonai"" (which is ""kyrios"" in greek and ""dominus"" in latin). all of those forms are masculine and translate as ""lord."" lord obviously has masculine, dominant conotations. since all these forms are masculine, the masculine idea of God was pushed over God's name. God is often also referred to as ""elohim"" which has no gender. the shortened, ""eloh,"" however is feminine and means goddess, so the addition of ""im"" at the end could make the translation of the word merely mean, “god,” “gods,” “goddess,” or “diety.”\n\nwhoever stated that the term for spirit was ruah and was feminine was also correct. it is important to note that the spiri"
"2","Why aren't there enough people in this world who can teach physics the easy way?","everybody is an asshole.","It's a good question, and I'm not really sure of the answer.  It may have something do do with the fact that some people are talented and motivated to be teachers, some are talented and motivated to be physicists, and there's no apparent reason to suspect a broad overlap of the two.  I've had several physics professors who are obviously physicists first, and teachers just because its part of their job description.  \n    \nOn the other hand, what is the 'easy way' to learn physics?  If you  want an overall aesthetic appreciation of the subject, listening to or watching some of the Feynman Lectures will do the trick (I recommend this, you may be able to find them for free online).  But if you want to be able to DO physics, you HAVE to learn the math involved; physics is inextricably linked to mathematics.  \n\nOne problem I see is that teachers do not provide enough opportunities for student feedback.  Most physics curricula are rigid, and alot of teachers (unfortunately) just try to push through the course, without stopping to check if everyone is on board.  And oftentimes it seems like they just don't care.  Everyone learns subjects differently, and physics is no exception.  Teachers ought to respect this in and out of the classroom.\n\nA guy named Paul Hewitt wrote a textbook and made some lecture videos called 'Conceptual Physics' that profess to be an alternative to the standard rigorous mathematics of college physics classes.  I've seen some of the videos.  They're good...but they're still physics lectures. \n\nPractical advice:  Work problem sets out with a friend, or see a tutor.  A different perspective helps fill in alot of the gaps.  \nAlso, post questions in yahoo! answers and other forums.  An army of sad losers is waiting to help."

I was sitting in bryant park on my lunch break today watching them and wondering; why?","Although the ""balance"" hypothesis sounds logical, experiments have determined that the head-bob of pigeons is rather related to vision.\n\nI'll quote myself (from the answer at the bottom link):\nHead bobbing has been hypothesized to be related to vision.\nWhen a bird's head is still, the images can form on the retina without the blur of motion. \nNow you're thinking: but the head is not still, it's bobbing! \nHowever, this is a visual effect, and in reality the head is keeping immobile, while the body moves. Head bobbing increases the stillness of the head during walking, running and landing. \nHead bobbing is not caused by an anatomical link of feet to neck or something like that; instead, it's synchronized with the movements of the feet, and although this could and has suggested a biomechanical function (balance, like our arm-swinging movements during walking), experiments have proven that head motions are determined by visual stimuli rather than biomechanical or inner-ear stimulation. \n\nThis is from a research paper:\nhttp://www.biomotionlab.ca/Text/TrojeFrost00.pdf"

"3","Cleaning up a broken fluorescent tube?","Hi there :)\n\nI accidently hit a glass fluorescent tube that was laying on a shelf in my office probably around 11PM - had to go somewhere though, so I just left it on the floor (it's split into two pieces now).  Upon getting back (about 3 hours later I'd say?), I started looking up how to clean the broken tube up - because I thought that I heard something that was dangerous involved with doing so.\n\nWell - from what I've read it's extremely dangerous to do so .. and that you shouldn't even attempt it yourself.  It's really just one light (it has not had power to it in at least a week...) -  it's just broken into two pieces on the floor (which is carpet).  With it being cold, I read that any mercury inside would be liquid, which would spread and contaminate anything around it.\n\nSo my question is: Should I be worried?  Or is all this just public safety hype, and can I just go on an at least get it out of my office into the (unused) garage?","You've read something completly wrong. Even if the mercury were liquid, which it isn't in this case, it would evaporate. The small amount in a lamp isn't enough to worry about and posses no health risks. Mercury is a strange metal in that it acts like liquid. That includes wanting to evaporate.\n\nNot getting cut on the glass is the real problem."

Thanks, again.","I was in the Air Force driving 1000 miles to go home for a month leave. While I was driving in the high mountains around Reno, I fell asleep. I was traveling about 85 mph. My truck veered off the highway. As soon as I felt the truck leave the highway, I woke up and found I was heading downward on the gravel part of the side of the highway. My truck seemed to be driving itself I was in shock. The steering wheel was moving under my hands. I can't describe it any better than this. As the truck moved back up to the highway, I pulled over and tried to calm down. It was a really frightening moment. What was even more frightening was just 1/4 mile more and the side of the highway no longer had gravel. There were large boulders. I still get chills thinking about it.\n\nTill the day I die, I know I was not the one driving my truck at that moment.\n\nbtw - I have had several other experiences where the circumstances involved other than human interaction. I guess I am just one of the few to have been fortunate enough to experience it."
"2","are  there any other universes around ours ?","","It's possible according to Brane theory.  Brane theory is a hyperdimensional theory in which all of reality consists of 11 dimensions.  In this theory, our universe is a ""membrane,"" having the physical laws and constants necessary for life as we know it to exists.\n\nIn Brane theory, there are infinite numbers of parallel ""membranes,"" or universes if you will, existing beneath visible reality.  These membranes may be incredibly like our own or so different that life as we know it can not exist because of the difference between physical laws and constants.\n\nIf brane theory holds true, then there are parallel universes that exist just beyond our reach.  There's even talk of trying to recreate the conditions of the big bang, because in theory, it would spark another universe, without affecting our own."

"1","at what point in time and why did Queen Elizabeth's Mother's surnames Bowes and Lyon become hyphenated?","I'm related to the Bowes side, as well as being the 6th Great Niece of the late Princess Diana's 6th Great Aunt, through marriage.","The Bowes-Lyon family is descended from Robert II, King of Scotland from 1371 to 1390, whose daughter Lady Jean Stewart married his Chamberlain, Sir John Lyon of Forteviot, in 1376.\n  \nIn 1372 Sir John had been granted the Royal estate of Glamis (home of Macbeth in the eleventh century) along with the title of Thane of Glamis. His grandson, Patrick, was created Baron Glamis in 1445 and the 9th Lord Glamis was created Earl of Kinghorne in 1606.  \n\nThe 3rd Earl, a Lord of the Treasury and an Extraordinary Lord of Session, was created Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon, Lord Glamis, Tannadyce, Sidlaw and Strathdichtie in 1677.  \n\nThe family, once the richest in Scotland, spent its fortune in the English Civil War. In the 18th century, it recovered when the 9th Earl married a wealthy heiress by the name of Mary Eleanor Bowes. The family name was then changed from Lyon to Bowes. But as soon as the first Bowes died, the 11th Earl changed the name to Lyon-Bowes. The 13th Earl eventually changed it to Bowes-Lyon."

All the pastors ever did was talk about how if we did one bad thing and did not ask forgiveness, we were going to ""hell"". People who did not accept Jesus...""going to hell"". \n\nSame thing with Islam. ""Non-beleivers"", oh, they get to kill us by law of their Qu'ran, PLUS we all go to hell. Double Jeapordy!\n\nI read a portion of the Upanishads that speaks of a hell for the unfaithful and/or unbeleivers. Wow.\n\nI beleive in a Supreme Being, ""God"" if you will. Why would that Great Being create us Human Man, and desire for us to be divided by  worship? It makes no sense. All these things were put here for all of us on Earth, and yet, we war and fight in the name of religions, divided by our view of ""GOD"", even the lack thereof.  Shouldn't this quest be a personal one? Shouldn't one's relationship with their creator be divine unto itself, and need no restrictive guideline to fall into?","Yes, I totally agree that organized religion is divisive and exclusive.  And that our spirituality and quest for a relationship with God is personal.\n\nOrganized religions teach us to live fear-based lives in order to control the masses and advance their own agenda.  They teach people to be mindless sheep and just accept what they are told without question.  They teach us to hate people who follow other religions.  Hate is not God.  Love is God.  We are all on different paths and different points on those paths to the same place.  God.\n\nI feel that if we are really to follow Christ's teaching we will love our neighbour as ourself and leave the judgments to God.  I don't personally believe in a place called hell.  \n\nI think we create our own hell for ourselves within ourselves.  Hell is here on earth.  Where people kill in the name of God (or whatever name they give God).  \n\nI can never accept within my heart that God loves some and not others or that God loves some more than others.  No.  God created us all and loves all of her creations.  \n\nAs far as hell goes, I think that if people believe in hell, they will get it, because our beliefs are powerful creators of our own reality.\n\nI believe in God/Life/Love.  I am trying to live a love-based life, and not a fear-based one as taught by organized religion."

"1","Da Vinci Code...should I read the book? watch the movie? or neither?","I am trying to decide if I should stay away from the hype, but it's every where.","The book is an excellent mystery that will keep you turning the pages.  I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie because the movie may be hard to follow if you have not read the book.  At least for me it would have been.\n\nFirst thing you must realize if you are going to read the book, is that it is fiction, and should be taken as FICTION ONLY.  Even though there may be parts which ARE true, you should not get your information about history, religion, and art from a book of fiction.  Absolutely assume that it is all fiction.  Then if you want to later find out where the truth is, you'll just have to do the work of consulting scholarly works, history books, and the Bible as well as the other Gospels that did not make it into the Bible.\n\nSo if you are looking for a good fiction and awesome mystery story, read it and see it.  If you are looking only for historical truth on the matters covered, then do not read it or see it, because it is a terrible source for factual information.  As I say, even though some of the information may be true, you won't be able to know the truth from the falsehood, and there is DEFINITELY falsehood in the book.  Afterall, it IS a fiction novel."

A belief in God (as depicted in the Bible) has ABSOLUTELY NO ROOM for macroevolution.  Similarly, a belief in macroevolution has NO PLACE for God.  \n\nSome individuals try to merge the two, saying that God used macroevolution as THE CREATION MACHINERY.

I am asking cause again, I dont' want to go there, but my mind is like this is the only way, then once I get to my goal weight I will be okay and can eat NORMALLY again....","Look child.  F that.  Stop trying to be a stick.  You did not gain weight over night and you will not loose it over night.  It will probably take you 3 times and long to loose it as it did to gain it.  I know.  I used to be super skinny, and I an now like a size 14/16.  I would love to loose 40-50 pounds and be a size 8, but I must learn to love myself no matter what weight I am.  I have lost and gained over the years, but I have learned from all success and failure.  You will derail your efforts if you stop eating or start throwing up.  Not only will you loose fat, but you will loose muscle.  You need to build up your muscle first by doing some resistance training so that you will burn more fat while you are at rest.  You may also need to try a diet program like weight watchers or myonlinefooddiary.com.  Remember we gain and loose sometimes because of stress or depression.  You need to heal your inside first before you focus on your outside.  Once you love yourself being big, you will see how many other people love big women too.  Be good, and think about it please."

"2","who can give me some info about Pluto ?","","the planet?Pluto is the farthest planet from the Sun (usually) and by far the smallest. Pluto is smaller than seven of the solar system's moons (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan and Triton). \n\n        orbit:    5,913,520,000 km (39.5 AU) from the Sun (average)\n        diameter: 2274 km\n        mass:     1.27e22 kg\nIn Roman mythology, Pluto (Greek: Hades) is the god of the underworld. The planet received this name (after many other suggestions) perhaps because it's so far from the Sun that it is in perpetual darkness and perhaps because ""PL"" are the initials of Percival Lowell. \nPluto was discovered in 1930 by a fortunate accident. Calculations which later turned out to be in error had predicted a planet beyond Neptune, based on the motions of Uranus and Neptune. Not knowing of the error, Clyde W. Tombaugh at Lowell Observatory in Arizona did a very careful sky survey which turned up Pluto anyway. \nAfter the discovery of Pluto, it was quickly determined that Pluto was too small to account for the discrepancies in the orbits of the other planets. The search for Planet X continued but nothing was found. Nor is it likely that it ever will be: the discrepancies vanish if the mass of Neptune determined from the Voyager 2 encounter with Neptune is used. There is no Planet X. But that doesn't mean there aren't other objects out there, only that there isn't a relatively large and close one like Planet X was assumed to be. In fact, we now know that there are a very large number of smaller objects in the Kuiper Belt beyond the orbit of Neptune. \nPluto is the only planet that has not been visited by a spacecraft. Even the Hubble Space Telescope can resolve only the largest features on its surface (left and above). A spacecraft called New Horizons was launched in January 2006. If all goes well it should reach Pluto in 2015. \nFortunately, Pluto has a satellite, Charon. By good fortune, Charon was discovered (in 1978) just before its orbital plane moved edge-on toward the inner solar system. It was therefore possible to observe many transits of Pluto over Charon and vice versa. By carefully calculating which portions of which body would be covered at what times, and watching brightness curves, astronomers were able to construct a rough map of light and dark areas on both bodies. \nIn late 2005, a team using the Hubble Space Telescope discovered two additional tiny moons orbiting Pluto. Provisionally designated S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2, they will be assigned real names when the discovery is confirmed. They are estimated to be between 60 and 200 kilometers in diameter. \nPluto's radius is not well known. JPL's value of 1137 is given with an error of +/-8, almost one percent. \nThough the sum of the masses of Pluto and Charon is known pretty well (it can be determined from careful measurements of the period and radius of Charon's orbit and basic physics) the individual masses of Pluto and Charon are difficult to determine because that requires determining their mutual motions around the center of mass of the system which requires much finer measurements -- they're so small and far away that even HST has difficulty. The ratio of their masses is probably somewhere between 0.084 and 0.157; more observations are underway but we won't get really accurate data until a spacecraft is sent. \nPluto is the second most contrasty body in the Solar System (after Iapetus). \nThere are some who think Pluto would be better classified as a large asteroid or comet rather than as a planet. Some consider it to be one of the larger Kuiper Belt objects (also known as Trans-Neptunian Objects). There is considerable merit to the latter position, but historically Pluto has been classified as a planet and it is very likely to remain so. Further complicating the situation, one such object (2003UB313) was recently discovered that is almost certainly larger than Pluto. Should it, too, be classified as"

"2","Why infrared signal can be detected by ccd camera?","Why it looks white?","CCDs are naturally sensitive out to about 1000 nm (nanometers), while the human eye can't see much past 760 nm. CCD cameras have infrared blocking filters, but some of them still let a fair amount of infrared in. A quick test of whether your camera is infrared sensitive is to point your TV remote at it and push a button. If it's sensitive, you'll see the IR LED light up in the LCD viewer.\n\nA CCD camera uses red, green, and blue filtered pixels to form a color image. Infrared looks white because apparently all of these pixel filters let IR through."

"1","Where is the missing link between Apes and Humans?","Is it possible that the missing link is in fact an alien hybrid?","Humans did not evolve from apes nor the other way around.  However humans and apes do share a common ancestor.  This ancestor was not human or ape but it was the foundation from which they both evolved on two separate and distinct paths (evolutionary tracts). In fact most people have heard the apes are the closest species related to humans, but the truth is, Chimpanzees are the closet to us, genetically, physically and in mental capabilities. Apes and Humans diverged on separate evolutionary tracks about 8 million years ago while Humans and Chimps only diverged at about 5 million yrs ago.\nThere is a 4% genetic-sequence difference between chimps and Humans, which means that our DNA is 96% identical. But we did not evolve from one another, we just shared a distant, now extinct relative.  Hope this clears things up."

Note though that you cannot have a full moon in the sky during the day since a full moon means that the earth, sun and moon all line up. You can have a new moon in the sky during the day since the moon is then between us and the sun and all we see is the dark side."
"3","what is love?","what is it and how can you tell if you are in love?","""Love"" is a very subjective term...we use the word love for many things, such as: I love my cat; I love coffee; I love my mother. The question that you have to ask is this; is your coffee on the same platform as your cat, and is your cat on the same platform as your mother? The answer is usually no, I love my cat more than my coffee, and I love my mother more than my cat(hence the USUALLY in there).\nBut what ""love"" actually is, the actual happening of ""being in love"", is a chemical reaction that happens within the brain at the meeting of someone that enhances said chemicals therein. You then get the physical signs of butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms, and so on and so forth. Also through that comes arousal and then the ""urge"" to...um...procreate. That is the ""physical"" side of love.\nThe ""mental"" or ""psychological"" love comes from a deep connection with another person where you feel safe, secure, and otherwise happier. You feel relaxed, are open to communication and debate, and you feel a deep sense of self. That is the ""mental"" love...\nBut love within itself is hard to pin down and hard to describe. If you are ""in-love"" you're in love, no matter what anyone else tells you. I suggest that to find love, you must know yourself; only through that can you be ""open"" enough for true fulfillment from another person."

In Kindergarten I admit to staring at her hands all the time, especially when she played piano. ""HOW did she do it?"" But, over the years, I stopped even noticing (as did the other students). It became normal to us.\n\nShe still teaches music to this day at the same school and my own son has had her for music. He has yet to say a word about her missing fingers.\n\nI admire how she did what she loved no matter what. She must have had to work extra hard, but it didn't show.

They are not an MD, but like any professional medical program (psychologists, pharmacists, etc.) must attend a school specific to their field to earn their doctorate.  The Board of Chiropractic Examiners regulates the practice of chiropractic\nand grants licenses to Chiropractors who meet educational requirements and\npass the state board examination.  The board also requires practitioners to\ncomplete annual postgraduate study for license renewal.  Currently, the \nState of California requires that candidates complete at least two years of\npre-chiropractic education plus 4,400 hours of course work in a recognized\nchiropractic school or have a valid license from another state.\n Chiropractors/Doctors of Chiropractic take patient histories, conduct\nphysical examinations, diagnose and give treatments for illness and injury.\nBecause of the emphasis on the spine and its position, most Chiropractors\nuse x-rays to help locate the source of patients' difficulties and also to\nrule out fractures or disease.\n\nChiropractors treat patients primarily by manual adjustments, especially of\nthe spinal column.  They use different therapies including massage, water,\nlight, ultrasound, electric, cold and heat to aid in the healing of the\nmuscles, joints, and nerves.  They may make dietary and nutritional\nrecommendations, advise on exercise and sleeping habits and also may suggest\nand apply the use of supports such as straps, tapes, bandages, and braces if\ndeemed necessary.\n\nSome Chiropractors specialize in athletic injuries, neurology, orthopedics,\nnutrition, and internal disorders.  Others specialize in taking and\ninterpreting X-rays and other diagnostic images.\n\nChiropractors do not prescribe drugs or perform surgery.  If they discover\nevidence of disease, injury or condition which is outside their scope of\npractice, they must refer the patient to an appropriate health care\nprovider."

I have listed some info on Insomnia and Acne for you that I give to my patients. Hope this helps you out.\n\n \nDifficulty in falling or staying asleep. Insomnia affects almost one third of the population.\n\nSymptoms\n\nInability to fall asleep\n\nWaking up throughout the night and not being able to get back to sleep\n\nWaking up too early\n\nSymptoms of tiredness and irritability are commonly experienced during the day due to lack of sleep\n\n\n\nCauses\nOccasional and temporary disturbance of one's normal sleeping pattern is normal and not cause for concern - anxiety, depression, worry or excitement are the most common causes, and the insomnia goes away when the cause is resolved.\nOther causes include excessive pain, caffeine consumption, abuse of alcohol, certain recreational and medicinal drugs, and poor sleeping habits (such as excessive napping during the day, or doing shift work) .\n\n\nPhysical ailments that can interfere with your sleep include disorders of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and digestive system. \n\n\n\nInsomnia, sometimes in conjunction with night sweats, can also be one of the symptoms of menopause. \nNatural Therapies\n\n\nValerian, Passionflower and Hops are sedative herbs that can help you to sleep; they should be taken approximately one hour before going to bed\n\nHelping your body to cope with stress commonly results in better sleeping patterns; try taking a B group vitamin complex supplement, preferably with magnesium, during the day to help your sleep at night time\n\nHypericum can help if depression is associated with insomnia \n\nPrevention\nA well-balanced lifestyle incorporating a healthy diet with regular exercise and relaxation is the best prevention from insomnia.\n\n\nEnsure your bedroom is quiet, dark and well-ventilated. Ear plugs and eye-shades may help to reduce noise and light, and are particularly valuable for shift workers.\n\nACNE\n\nAcne is usually considered an adolescent affliction affecting up to 80 percent of teenagers. Although acne occurs most commonly in adolescent males, it can affect people of any age.\n\nSymptoms\nAcne vulgaris, the most common form of acne, consists of whiteheads, blackheads, pimples and deep cysts that appear mainly on the face and to a lesser extent on the chest, shoulders and back. \n\nAcne is often worse during winter, improving during summer. \n\n\nCauses\nAcne commences when the sebaceous ducts in the skin become blocked by skin overgrowth to form a whitehead, or by plugs of sebum which darken on exposure to air forming a blackhead. \n\n\nWhen the sebum trapped in the whitehead or blackhead is forced into the deeper skin layers, an inflammatory reaction causes a red lump called a papule. If infection follows, pus collects and the classic pimple (pustule) is seen. When the inflammatory condition is severe, large, painful cysts may form.\n\n\nAcne is associated with hormonal imbalance, and will typically develop during puberty when hormonal activity increases the size and activity of the sebaceous glands. Some women also experience acne as a component of pre-menstrual syndrome.\n\n\nThe naturopathic view is that acne is aggravated by ineffective elimination from the body, which may be related to a build up of toxins in the system due to an inability of the liver to effectively break down circulatory toxins. It can also be initiated by food sensitivities, poor diet and stress.\n\n\n\nNatural Therapies\n\n\n\n\nZinc is an essential mineral used for wound healing and the normal oil gland function of the skin. It is also involved in the maintenance of vitamin A levels, transport and usage; for protein synthesis, (particularly collagen synthesis); and to help maintain hormonal balance. \n\nBeta-carotene is transformed into vitamin A in the body. These two nutrients act as skin antioxidants, and may be of assistance in the treatment of acne, other skin conditions, and the healing of wounds. \n\nSulphur is traditionally indic"
"1","why do people from mexico hate being called mexicans?","","I know several people from Mexico, and they are proud to be Mexican. Yet people from Mexico dislike being called Mexicans in a context which indicates them as being stupid, incompetent, or ""lesser"" than another person or race (wouldn't you?). This is especially common in the United States. It's not right, but it happens nonetheless."
"2","Explain Gastrulation in human embryos?","my main concern is to know about morphogenetic movement.","Gastrulation in Human Embryo\n\nDelamination precedes gastrulation separating ICM into epiblast & hypoblast \nGastrulation occurs in epiblast (future embryo) \nGastrulation involves several types of movements and shape changes \nEnd product is three germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm \nThe expression of certain genes regulates the formation of the embryonic axes & the organization of the embryo \nThe Timing of Gastrulation and Subsequent Events\nGastrulation begins about 15 days of development and is followed by neurulation and the start of development of several major organ systems \n\nRole of Gastrulation\nGastrulation will covert the bilaminate epiblast into the three primary embryonic germ layers \nEctoderm: outside; this embryonic layer more or less surrounds the other germ layers \nMesoderm: middle; this germ layer lies between the ectoderm and mesoderm \nEndoderm: inside; this germ layer lies at the most interior of the embryo \nSubsequently neurulation will form epithelial and neural ectoderm from the ectoderm \n\nDuring human gastrulation, cells move over the blastodisc surface, enter the primitive streak and move internally. On the surface they move in association with other cells but once they turn the corner around the lip of the primitive streak the cells separate as individuals to migrate internally to form the mesoderm and endoderm. These are just some of the types of cell movements that occur in animal embryos. Here's a full list\n\nIngression: cells break away from the tissue and migrate as individuals \nDelamination: layers of cells separate from each others more or less as sheets of cells \nIntercalation: two cell layers interlace with each other \nEpiboly: a form of cell spreading in which cells flatten out; this allows them to cover a much larger surface area (1st detailed in frog development). \nInvagination (Evagination): a tissue layer folds in (out) \nInvolution: cells move over a lip of tissue and into the interior \nConvergent Extension: cells reorganize to form less layers allowing the cells to extend out from a point. \nNot all of these morphogenetic movements have been detailed in humans but they all have been shown to occur in other animals. Also remember, one type of cellular rearrangement does not exclude another with several different types of movement potentially occurring at the same time."

Imagine a village where the needs of the village include fishing, home building, cooking, pottery making, weaving, hunting, etc. We could imagine everyone trying to do everything, but we'd soon see that it just makes more sense for some people to spend more time doing the things they are good at. But for them to trade this gets difficult. A close-knit village might manage it, but a larger group needs some way of keeping track of who does what. Some systems just have everyone pitch in. This can be a logistical challenge. Other systems, like capitalism, allow people to earn their own living. They need currency to make trading more efficient. (otherwise you'd have to try to pay the home-builder in fish, and a person can only handle so many fish.)"

For instance, I worked with Americans for most of my working life, and I found the people I worked with to be intelligent and hard-working.  I was always amazed by their sheer enthusiasm and stamina.  I had good energy levels, but they left me behind.  So ..... I would say that from my own experience I made lots of friends (I still e-mail friends on the East and West coast to this day).\n\nHowever, there is a broad concept in the British Isles that most Americans are dumb and loud-mouthed.  That they are war-mongerers, and greedy.  That they pollute the planet with their gas-guzzling cars and will not sign the Kyoti Agreement because it will affect their lives too dramatically.  In London the American Embassy has refused to pay the London traffic congestion charge because they have deemed it a tax ... notwithstanding that every single Londoner has to pay this charge and it is more in the way of a toll than a tax.  So .... all around me I hear complaints about Americans, but I have nothing but good experiences.\n\nMost people here (as in America I am sure) generalise.

I am a Classics Major, and have participated in Archaeological digs. I appreciate any bit of history. Aha! Keyword there- history. Just because you found something that could be an ark does not prove God exists. I'm sorry. The bible was written by man, therefore is loaded with flaws and corruption. It is mans interpretation of what was supposed to be God's word. Therefore, it is WRITTEN HISTORY. Of course some of the stories hold truths, because they were written by men! Of course they will include something like a MASSIVE FLOOD. It still doesn't prove God exists.  It could prove there was a massive flood(which we already know has happened on several occasions..melting of the ice caps, perhaps?) and ""Noah"" built it to stay safe. And, maybe Noah did exist.

"1","What do you consider taking up an offence?","In the Bible we are told to not take up an offence.  I have always found it interesting that if you follow the command to take up your cross you would have to lay it down to take up the offence.  As a Christian, laying down my cross is something I don't want to do, so I try very hard to not take up an offence.","Quiet Warrior,\n\nYou have a very good way to look at it. I am reminded that Jesus said, “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.” He was certainly asking His Father not to charge His judges and tormentors and executioners with their offenses against Him, but also they REALLY didn’t understand what they were doing.\n\nIt is very easy to see that they offended Him, but not quite so easy to see that they really didn’t understand what they were doing. Pilate seemed to have a sense that he condemned an innocent man; the high priest uttered prophetically, “It is better for one man to die for all the people,” and the crowd shouted, “His blood be upon us and our children.” One of the thieves realized that Jesus was a good man, and even one of the Roman soldiers realized after Jesus died that He was really the Son of God.\n\nHowever, none of them really understood the significance of what they were doing. That is also true of the people who offend us no matter how deliberate or shrewd they are. If people really understood the nature of their acts, then they wouldn’t do them.\n\nWe all look at an event like 9/11 and are horrified by the carnage, and it is incredible to us that anyone could commit such acts. Osama bin Laden and the other masterminds and perpetrators, in spite of their obvious planning and forethought, had no real concept of what they were doing. If they had your understanding, then they couldn’t have done it, could they?\n\nI can’t understand serial killers or child molesters or rapists or men who hit women, etc. The only way to really understand those things is to be capable of doing them, so I’m thankful that I don’t understand the way they think. By the same token, they don’t understand the way you or I think. It is foreign to them. If they really understood what they were doing then they couldn’t do it, could they?\n\nAnyway, this line of thinking helps me to forgive just as yours does. It is also good to see that if I don’t forgive others, then God can’t forgive me. That’s a really good motivator.\n\nGod bless."

"1","Where did the F word originate and was it originally used as another word for sex?","","F**k is an English word which, when used literally as a verb, means ""to engage in sexual intercourse"". It is generally considered to be an offensive profanity. Its origins may be Germanic, akin to the synonymous German ""ficken"", which had the original meaning, ""to strike"".\n\nIt is unclear whether the word has always been considered vulgar, and if not, when it first started to be considered vulgar. Some evidence indicates that in some English-speaking locales it was considered acceptable as late as the 17th century meaning ""to strike"" or ""to penetrate"". Other evidence indicates that it may have become vulgar as early as the 16th century in England, although neither set of evidence is inherently contradictory to the other, since many words have multiple connotations. The etymology (origin) of the word is uncertain.\n\nThere are several urban-legend false etymologies postulating an acronymic origin for the word. One legend holds that the word f**k came from Irish law. If a couple were caught committing adultery they would be punished ""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge In the Nude"", with ""F U C K I N'"" written on the stocks above them to denote the crime."

Do in sets of three-five ranging any where from 15-20 reps.  Leg Curls with a lot of weight. Concentrate on the Flex part of the exercise control on the way down, do more weight less reps. I can't tell you exactly because I don't know what your current range is. Squats are okay, but most people do them wrong. When squatting push from your heels also keep your feet slightly forward of your body toes pointing straight out. Concentrate on the push, really blast it out (going up) hold tension on the way down, (slowly return) Also, here more weight less reps. Also on squats you do not go all the way down you don't go more than 45 degrees. Going to far with out training can do harm. Work towards getting deeper don't just jump into it.\nStadiums are really good for your bum as well.

"3","What is the best way to rebuild the digestive track after taking antibiotics?","","This is one of the few medical questions I am fully qualified to answer. I expect you're referring to the c-diff (clostridium difficile) toxin and the resulting horrors when it takes over the colon and begins to destroy healthy gut flora (this is the healthy and necessary bacteria which resides in our digestive tracts and allows us to process and digest food). Antibiotics CAUSE this deadly condition and we still overuse and abuse them. Astonishing!\n\nI very nearly died of the resulting disease process (pseudomembranous enterocolitis) 15 years ago and was in and out of hospital for six months. It was the worst and most frightening experience of my life but I survived it and am a healthier and in many respects a better person for having endured that ordeal. Enough of that.\n\nWhat you need to know is this: Avoid antiobiotics like the plague unless your illness is life-threatening (I haven't touched them in 15 years and I've had plenty of bouts with bronchitis, et al). If you are obliged to take them, don't just focus on rebuilding your normal gut flora after the fact; try to keep it strong throughout the period you are actually taking the antibiotics. \n\nThe best method is to ingest probiotics like lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidus. You can find these naturally in yogurt, but make sure the label indicates the presence of ""live and active cultures"" in whatever brand you buy or it will be worthless. You can also find acidophilus milk at many grocery stores. Both lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidus, as well as some other beneficial probiotics, can be found as supplements in health food stores, usually in capsule or powder form which needs to be refrigerated. \n\nI hope this helps. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask by using the ""Add Details"" link on your original question page. Good luck!"

"2","what is chondromalacia?","","It is the wearing away and/or softening of the articular cartilage. \n\nThe articular cartilage is a connective tissue that covers and protects the underside of the patella, the bottom end of the femur, and top end of the tibia. It absorbs stress to the knee joint and allows the patella to track smoothly in its femoral groove.\n\nCauses typically include excessive running or similar activity can wear down the articular cartilage over time. This can occur due to the patella not tracking smoothly in its femoral groove.\n\nThe symptoms include pain around the patella (kneecap), usually occurring on the medial (inner) side and below (inferior aspect of the patella).\n\nRecommended Treatment would be R.I.C.E. - Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. Reduce activity to promote healing. Avoid downhill runs especially. Strengthen surrounding muscles with a professionally recommended program. Apply Ice for 10-15 minutes after each workout to reduce inflammation and pain. (If any skin irritation or adverse reaction occurs due to icing, see your medical doctor). A proper stretching (Quadriceps, Iliotibial Band) routine is highly recommended pre and post workouts. As with any orthopedic injury, a consultation with a sports medicine professional is recommended."

"2","How much scientific proof is there for evolution?","","The short answer: a lot!\n\nThe long answer:\n\nScience is not about finding a single piece of evidence to conclusively prove a theory. It's about constructing theories to fit the existing evidence and gathering new evidence that supports or refutes existing theories. Evolution is supported by a preponderance of evidence. While no one point conclusively proves it, when all the evidence is considered in the context of existing scientific knowledge evolution is a well substantiated theory. Intelligent design is not.  What follows are brief explanations of some of the evidence that supports the theory of evolution.\n\n1. Vestigial structures\n\nOne example of a vestigial structure in humans is the appendix. It has no function. Removing it is harmful only in so far as any surgery is associated with certain risks (so I wouldn't have it removed just for fun, but it's because of the surgery not the absence of the appendix). An appendix is found in several mammals. In humans it is small and has no known function. In rabbits and many other herbivores it is large and is used in the digestion of cellulose.\n\nAnother example of a vestigial structure is the hipbones of snakes. Snakes evolved from quadrupeds, and some species still retain not on pelvises, but tiny protrusions of bone in a location that corresponds to the location of the legs in other quadrupeds.\n\n2. Microevolution can be observed in both a controlled laboratory setting and in nature.\n\nCreationists will tell you that microevolution does not prove macroevolution.  This is true.  However, it does provide evidence that macroevolution may be possible. Taken in the context of the other evidence for evolution, microevolution provides a mechanism by which macroevolution could occur. On its own, it doesn't prove that macroevolution occurs, but it does suggest that it is possible.\n\n3. The fossil record.\n\nAlthough the fossil record does not provide a “complete” record as fossils form only under certain conditions, it does show a gradual change in the morphology of species as well as numerous extinct species.  There are a number of methods used to date fossils, and the time period from which a fossil comes can be determined with reasonable accuracy.\n\n4. Imperfect structures (the blind spot of the mammalian eye, for example).\n\nI want to mention the bind-spot of the mammalian eye specifically because creationists often hold up the human eye up as an example of something that is too perfect to occur by ""chance"" (i.e. as the result of the natural selection of beneficial changes among random mutations).\n\nThere are also numerous examples where the morphology of a species is constrained by similar patterns in its ancestors (quadrupeds, vertebrates, etc.).\n\n5. Developmental biology reflects evolutionary lineage.\n\nCreationists like to bring up a man named Haeckel in response to this argument.  Haeckel suggested that development reflects evolutionary origin.  It was later discovered that several of the sketches he used as evidence over-exaggerated certain features, and some were of different embryos all together. However, many of his sketches do accurately reflect the morphology of the embryo. Haeckel's methods were sometimes wrong and his ethics were poor, but it just so happens that his theory turned out to be fairly accurate.\n\nAny developmental biologist can tell you that embryos of related species show similar morphology in the early stages of development. The point at which their development begins to diverge shows a strong correlation with the relative point at which the evolution of the two species diverged. Human embryos look similar to chimpanzee embryos for a lot longer than they look similar to cat embryos, but all three develop similar structures in the early stages of development. The early embryos of humans, chimps, and cats are similar to each other but quite different from, say, a sea urchin embryo. This is based on photograp"

"2","where to learn how to Balance Equations?","I was just wondering, besides using a Chemisty or any kind of book, what internet site can i use that will help teach me how to balance equations in 48 hours. I already know what ""ions, radicalals"" and stuff are. I just need the steps on how to Balance an equation.","Balancing Chemical Equations is absolutely essential if you want to determine quantities of reactants or products. An unbalanced Chemical Equation gives only the identify of the beginning reactants and the final products using the appropriate formulas as well as the conditions of temperature, physical state, and pressure conditions under which the reaction is to operate under. However an unbalanced equation can say nothing about the quantities involved until the equation has been balanced. A balanced equation assures that the Conservation Law of matter is obeyed. The total mass of reactants must equal the total mass of products. A balanced equation is like a recipe. It tells you the proportional quantities of each substance involved. The coefficients that appear to the left of each formula can be interpreted as mole units or molecules, but for practical purposes, the coefficients will be interpreted as mole units. No coefficient is interpreted as 1 mole. The following principles should be employed when balancing a Chemical Equation by inspection:\n\n   1. Never touch subscripts when balancing equations since that will change the composition and therefore the substance itself.\n   2. Check to be sure that you have included all sources of a particular element that you are balancing on a particular side since there may be two or more compounds that contain the same element on a given side of an equation.\n   3. I would suggest that you adjust the coefficient of mono atomic elements near the end of the balancing act since any change in their coefficient will not affect the balance of other elements\n   4. When there are a group of atoms that are acting as a unit such as a polyatomic ion and they appear intact on both sides of the equation, it is best to balance them as a self contaned group. For example, if there are Phosphate groups, PO4-3, that appear on both sides, balance the phosphates as a group instead of separating the Phosphorus and Oxygens. It can be done either way, but there is less likely of a mistake if they are balanced as Phosphate groups.\n\nConsider the example of:\n\n(NH4)2CO3 ---> NH3 + CO2 + H2O\n\nThe first thing to do is choose a starting point. If we choose the carbon as the starting point, we go nowhere, since there is already one carbon on each side. Choosing oxygen is not good, because the oxygen is divided between two species on the right side. The interesting part is in the ammonium (NH4) ion. If we start with the nitrogen on the left (in the ammonium ion), we see that there are two nitrogens and therefore we must put at ""2"" in front of the ammonia on the right side.\n\n(NH4)2CO3 ---> 2 NH3 + CO2 + H2O\n\nSince we are already working with the ammonia, now consider the hydrogens that make up the rest of the molecule: the six hydrogens in the ammonia plus the two hydrogens in the water make eight hydrogens. Bouncing back across to the left side, we count eight hydrogens; since no other atomic species have been changed, we can count up everything and see that the reaction is now balanced:\n\n2 N, 8 H, 1 C, and 3 O on each side.\n\nNotice how the reaction itself led us through the steps of the balancing process. A more complex reaction would have involved more steps, but the process would have been the same.\n\nThis ""inspection method"" is the first one tried by chemists in the real world. Only when it fails to work, as in the case of many oxidation-reduction reactions, for example, are more complex procedures used.\n\nHere is another example:\n\nFe2(SO4)3 + K(SCN) ----> K3Fe(SCN)6 + K2SO4\n\nK3Fe(SCN)6 is pretty complicated. Now look at it and see what ions are in it that are not shared on the same side of the reaction. These are SCN and Fe.\n\nWe start to balance these\n\nFe2(SO4)3 + 6 K(SCN) ---> K3Fe(SCN)6 + K2SO4 Now we go left to right.\n\nThe irons are messed up, two on the Left, and one on the right. We adjust\n\nFe2(SO4)3 + 6 K(SCN) -- 2 K3Fe(SCN)6 + K2SO4 .\n\nNow t"

"3","Seasonale birth control?","Is it healthy? Any side effects besides the normal?\nhow much per month did/does it cost you.\n\nPreferably all the info i can get and hopefully from people on it or used to be.","My doctor said that Seasonale is perfectly safe as long as you have your normal periods and are healthy. I am taking my first packet now. It cost me $50.00 for 3 months with my insurance. I believe it is about $120.00 without insurance. I have not had any spotting at all. It is nice not having a period for so long, but I feel more emotional now. I used to be on Yasmin, and I believe Seasonale is higher in hormones. I can definately tell. I just feel a little moody all the time. It does have some pros though. When I took the Depo shot, I had a decreased sexual drive. I was worried about the same with the Seasonale, but I did not experience any decrease at all. Also, I gained about 3 pounds the first month, but it came back off the next month. I didn't feel bloated, like some birth control can make you feel. Overall, Seasonale is a good choice. Hopefully, they will come out with a lower hormone version soon. Then it will be a perfect pill."

"1","The legacy of colonization?","Are the problems of modern Africa the result of colonization by the European powers in the late 19th century, or did Africa derive more benefit than harm from colonization?","Yes. Europeans imported the concept of nationalism to Africa, which is meaningless to people that have expressed loyalty toward their own ethnic group or culture than their ""nation"". If you look at a place like Nigeria, there are several different languages spoken there besides English.\n  At the Berlin Conference of 1888, when European nations carved up Africa for themselves, that did it irregardless of the cultures in the region. Nationalism is one issue that African nations are going to adjust to.\n  Also, I would have to agree with the first answer, European customs have done away with the modes of government that have worked for them, long before Europe was even interested in African colonization.\n  Another issue is the issue of education. Europe used Africa for raw goods and resources and left Africans in a poor position to function well on their own. One example is the Congo. The Belgians robbed the Congo of their natural resources( Congo is one of the most resource abundant nations on Earth, yet it is one of the poorest) and left the Congelese uneducated. All of the professionals in the Congo such as doctors, etc were all Belgian.By analogy, Botswana also was colonized by Britain, and they are well-educated and have incorporated ancient customs with Western ideas.\n  In short, nationalism, education, and erosion of some of Africa's ancient forms of government are some of the causes of the problems in Africa today."
"3","Who has Bipolar Disorder? How long have you had it?","","As a child I would experience mood swings - happy one minute and sad the next minute. I started cutting my skin because of the sadness I felt inside. Since we were poor, my parents laughed me off - they didn't take me to see a doctor and instead blamed my moodiness on self-inflicted temper tantrums. While in school, I would always panic before taking tests and my palms would sweat. At age 21-25 I noticed a strange feeling of being too happy and all I wanted to do was spend, spend, spend and became unhappy when all the money was gone. I then sunk into deep depression blaming myself for anything. I was crying all the time even when I was happy.   When I finally turned 40yrs old, I became violent towards myself and of course, towards others. I was abusive. Then one day, I just jumped out of my car and ran down the railroad tracks... I wanted to kill myself - but for what and Why?  Today, I can't believe that I had done such a thing.  Anyway, at 40yrs I experirenced a major bout with depression and had to be hospitalized. After the usual tests were conducted, it was discovered that I had Rapid Cycling Bipolar. Was placed on Prozac, Paxil, and finally Valporic Acid = Depekote at 1000mg per day.  I'm 57yrs now, and sometimes feel so good that I don't take my medication... which is not good.  In other words, when I don't take my meds my seritonin attacks my system, so I must contiually remind myself that the meds are my friend and will help keep my brain balanced and help me to live one more day. A day without ups and downs.  A day of strength.  Yes, I have been diagnosed with Bipolar for 17 years, but really all my life.   If you are Bipolar please don't play doctor... take your medications and live a long life. You might even help someone like me - who is using this forum to answer your qustions.  This is good for my brain.... yeah?"
"3","how to make our teeth strong?","","Ingested fluoride is important until all your adult teeth are formed to help make the teeth strong.  To keep them strong and healthy brush at least 2 times a day for at least 2 minutes with a soft bristle brush.  The brush should be angled at 45 degrees and you should start at the gums and ""vibrate"" the brush.  Don't scrub back and forth.  This can cause recession and wear the enamel.  If this sounds like a lot of work think about a Sonicare toothbrush.  Floss daily.  Make sure you get under the gumline and wrap the floss like a ""C"" around each side.  You can also use an antimicrobial mouthwash like Listerine to keep the gums healthy.  Or you could use a fluoride mouthwash like ACT to help remineralize the enamel.  Also regular cleaning and exams (once every six months will be sufficient if you have no existing periodontal conditions or other dental problems) are very important to maintaining dental health."

"2","What is a neutron bomb and how it works?","","""Tactical neutron bombs are primarily intended to kill soldiers who are protected by armor. Armored vehicles are very resistant to blast and heat produced by nuclear weapons, but steel armor can reduce neutron radiation only by a modest amount so the lethal range from neutrons greatly exceeds that of other weapon effects. The lethal range for tactical neutron bombs can exceed the lethal range for blast and heat even for unprotected troops. Armor can absorb neutrons and neutron energy, thus reducing the neutron radiation to which the tank crew is exposed, but this offset to some extent by the fact that armor can also react harmfully with neutrons. Alloy steels for example can develop induced radioactivity that remains dangerous for some time. When fast neutrons are slowed down, the energy lost can show up as x-rays. Some types of armor, like that of the M-1 tank, employ depleted uranium which can undergo fast fission, generating additional neutrons and becoming radioactive. Special neutron absorbing armor techniques have also been developed, such as armors containing boronated plastics and the use of vehicle fuel as a shield.""\n\nreference: http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Outlaws/faq1\n\n""Also called ENHANCED RADIATION WARHEAD, specialized type of small thermonuclear weapon that produces minimal blast and heat but which releases large amounts of lethal radiation. The neutron bomb delivers blast and heat effects that are confined to an area of only a few hundred yards in radius. But within a somewhat larger area it throws off a massive wave of neutron and gamma radiation, which can penetrate armour or several feet of earth. This radiation is extremely destructive to living tissue. Because of its short-range destructiveness and the absence of long-range effect, the neutron bomb would be highly effective against tank and infantry formations on the battlefield but would not endanger cities or other population centres only a few miles away. It can be carried in a Lance missile or delivered by an 8-inch (200-millimetre) howitzer, or possibly by attack aircraft.\n\nIn strategic terms, the neutron bomb has a theoretical deterrent effect: discouraging an armoured ground assault by arousing the fear of neutron bomb counterattack. The bomb would disable enemy tank crews in minutes, and those exposed would die within days. U.S. production of the bomb was postponed in 1978 and resumed in 1981.""\n\nreference: http://www.britannica.com/seo/n/neutron-bomb/"

"2","explain how unstable nuclei become stable by releasing radiation?","","Atoms are most stable at certain energy levels.  If an atom goes above a particular level, it will release energy to go back.  Most of the time, this occurs as electromagnetic radiation, where an electron drops to a lower shell and releases heat (infrared light), light, or more energetic radiation (like x-rays).\n\nIn the case of radioactive decay or nuclear fission, the released radiation is in the form of nuclear particles: alpha particles are helium nuclei (no electrons) and have low energy, and beta particles are electrons, which are higher energy.  Gamma rays are electromeagnetic, not particulate, so they are just photons, and have very high energy."
"2","the plant cell is organized into two major compartments. what are they?","","The non-living cell wall surrounds the living protoplast. Within the cell wall the cell membrane encloses the cytoplasm containing organelles (chloroplasts, mitochondria, nucleus, etc.) and a vacuole.\nThe vacuole contains many chemicals dissolved in water. Osmotic pressure within the vacuole squashes the cytoplasm against the cell wall when the cell is turgid to provide shape and support.\nThe two major compartments of the living part of a plant cell are the cytoplasm and the vacuole."

We see billions of colors. We see many more colors, the world's many more colors, and we are anywhere from orange (the oompa loompa's) to red (burned)to purple (bruised), to blue(choking), to green (again bruised) to brown (or black), to tan or peach (whites).\n\nSo I guess the answer to your question is we're not green, the world is not blue, and we don't only see red... oh and the world is not blue (for the second time)"

"2","I have a science project that has to be the shape of a volcano, it has to be eatable and it has to erupt?","","Edible Volcano\n\nBefore \nAfter, showing pump and tube\n\nMany students build a volcano as a school project. This one looks great, works well, and is edible too!\n\nA small plastic bottle forms a container for the lava. Choose a bottle appropriate for the size of volcano you are making. Realize that it takes lots of mountain material to build a large volcano! The volcano picture above was made with 5 batches.\n\nA small hand-held water balloon pump, available at toy stores, is attached to a piece of flexible plastic tubing, available at hardware stores, pet shops, etc.\n\nThis tube can simply pass under the mountain, or for better appearance mount the volcano on a large flat cardboard box and pass the tubing through the box and out the side. IF you are using a box, make holes and pass the tubing through the box now.\n\nThe tubing passes through a small hole in the bottle. Pass it all the way up through and out the top, where you can attach a balloon. The pull the tube back down so the balloon is in the bottom of the bottle. Fix the tube in place and seal the opening with wax, hot glue, or similar. If you intend to eat the results, seal it with something non-toxic.\n\nThe main mountain material is Rice Krispy Treats. The recipe can be found on any cereal box of at the Rice Krispies web site. The mountain is shaped from this material, and then coated with peanut butter playdough (recipe below) and/or frosting. Use chocolate and vanilla frosting in various mixtures to create a variety of shades of color. Other edible materials can be used as well. Spray frosting, available in the cake decorating section of many grocery stores, comes in green and can be used to spray on realistic looking green colors.\n\nThe lava can be a variety of materials including honey colored red with food coloring, strawberry flavored ice cream topping, whipped topping thinned and dyed red, etc. Red sprinkles, red colored sugar, bits of marshmallow cream, or other ""additives"" gane give it a chuhnky, textured look if desired.\n\nFill the bottle with lava material, and pump up the ballon with the hand pump, pushing the lava out of the bottle and down the sides of the volcano.\n\n\nPEANUT BUTTER DOUGH INGREDIENTS:\n\n* 3 1/2 cups peanut butter\n* 4 cups confectioners' sugar\n* 3 1/2 cups honey\n* 4 cups dry milk powder\nHome\n\n© Copyright 2004 by Bill Lovegrove.

"3","What is the cost of Stereotactic Radio Surgery  ?","","Many patients travel from United States of America and UK to get low cost of Stereotactic Radio Surgery in India. One of the most frequently asked questions when considering Stereotactic Radio Surgery is ""how much?"" and “what is the price of surgery in India?”\n\n\nOftentimes, patients choose their surgeon on the basis of price. \nThe cost of Stereotactic Radio Surgery is very affordable in India and costs are much lower when compared to the United States, UK and other countries. However, since the success of your surgery is largely dependent on your choice of surgeon, cost should not be your main consideration for your decision to undergo Stereotactic Radio Surgery in India.\n\nI checked out the website of Forerunners Healthcare –which is the premier most medical tourism company in India offering low cost surgery in India to International Patients. They have served more than 400 International patients from across the globe (specially US and UK) to get low cost affordable surgery in India at the best Hospitals and Medical Institutions. And the general price of the Stereotactic Radio Surgery is as follows-\n\nThe Cost of Stereotactic Radio Surgery in India is $ 4,900.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\n\nIn India, any licensed medical doctor can perform Stereotactic Radio Surgery. To avoid unsatisfactory results, it is best to choose a surgeon who has completed an accredited residency-training program in Stereotactic Radio Surgery. He should have extensive experience in the procedure you will undergo. That’s when Forerunners Healthcare come into picture-helping you get the best surgeon for your surgery at the most affordable prices in the best Hospitals of India.\n\nYour surgeon's skill can make all the difference between a good and an average result. Thus, although it is understandable that price is one of the considerations in your choice of surgeon, it is important to remember that the main consideration should be your surgeon's professional qualifications and experience.\n\nBesides that you should look into other issues related to traveling abroad, which is your visa, passport, climate, cultural issues and language barrier. Although language is not a problem in India –as most of the people are well verse in English. But you should make sure that you have a reliable hand holding person to guide you through the various steps of getting medical treatment and surgery in India.\n\n\nHope this helps."

"1","textbook for advanced grammar/composition in Spanish?","do you know of any textbook used at american universities in advanced grammar/composition courses for Spanish majors/minors?? (not lower level courses).","I haven't taken any such course in Spanish, but I have for other languages.  Advanced courses frequently don't have textbooks because textbooks explain grammar and have short readings and exercises.  At the higher levels of language, you're expected to know the grammar, so you might use a grammar *reference* but not a textbook, and you'll probably be reading real literature instead of readings constructed to use limited vocabulary.  And your composition assignments will probably be defined by the teacher.  \n\nI can recommend this book for advanced grammar reference: A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish, by John Butt and Carmen Benjamin."
"1","When you're in a shopping mall, is it easy to tell what city or state you're in?","If you were to walk into four shopping malls in vastly different areas of the US, would it be easy for you tell--for example if you were in Buffalo, Minneapolis, Denver, Seattle or Mobile?","Except for speech patterns of the customers, and the obvious difference in apparel--like tons of winter stuff up north and none of it down here in the south--today's malls are clones.   Even the strip malls look the same.  \n\nI travel a lot, and it's almost impossible to tell where I am anymore by the interior or exterior of a mall.   The newer strip malls in Florida all strive to look like Miami-cool, even in Pensacola or St. Augustine.   I think it's a shame that they don't play up the differences and uniqueness of a city, but these malls are apparently also the work of the developers who spin out the cookie cutter housing developments.    Ever tried to find a specific house in a new development where you can't see the house numbers?  \n\nIn Florida, just look for the split level, pink/gray or sand color stucco exterior with white trim, with requisite garage as you first turn in the driveway.....good luck.   I like the older neighborhoods that have a little character.  I also like it better when the post offices were in older buildings, instead of the blue and brick clone, and when I could tell if I was in California or Florida or Detroit.\n\nOh well.   They say older folks don't adapt well to change.   This isn't change, this is overbearing sameness."

Even many parents don't know that a staph infection can cause a rash.\n\nAs a child, the only time we ever knew my oldest son had a strep throat was when he got a rash!  He never complained of a sore throat, ate normally and had no fever!  He was misdiagnosed a few times too until the pediatrician figured it out.  After that, the minute I saw the rash, we all knew what it was.\n\nI never saw it as a reason to change pediatricians.  Medicine is  not an exact science as all people are different and all manifest disease in different ways.  Doctors are human and will make mistakes too.

As pine stripe notes it depends on when they were blinded. People blinded after about 5 years of age have no problems. People blinded before that have difficulty re-adjusting.\n\nPeople blind from birth are really quite interesting when their site is restored. They never have any ability to judge perspective. They can recognise small cubes up close for example, but they see cubic buildings and truncated pyramids. That's because a building looks like it gets smaller at the top due to perspective. A person blind from birth can never learn to recognise that that is just an illusion. they literally see the building with a small top and large base. They also see railway tracts as converging lines and are fooled by similar tricks of perspective that sighted people automatically adjust for.\n\nWeird stuff."

"3","How can a person get rid of a sty (in their eye) ?","","Styes are very irritating and painful and the temptation is great to squeeze them to get rid of them. But this is not recommended as it will only worsen the infection possibly causing it to spread to other parts of the eyelid. Squeezing a stye is counterproductive and should be avoided. \n\n\nTo soften the head on the stye and to ease the pain, use warm compresses several times a day. Take a clean wash cloth and run it under very warm, but not hot, water and place it on the infected eye for 10 minutes. Do this between three and six times a day. \n\n\nMake sure you wash your hands thoroughly after using a compress or even touching the stye. The staphylococcus bacteria in the stye can spread causing more styes. Do not rub an eye with a stye. If you touch the infected eye and then touch your other eye, you will spread the infection to the other eye. It is not uncommon for a child to have a bout with several styes in their eyes over several months from spreading the infection. \n\n\nStyes should go away in about 3 or 4 days. If, however, the stye does not go away and seems to be getting worse see a doctor. You may need an opthalmalic antibiotic solution. \n\nFor more information and more solutions, check the website below. Good luck!!!"

There are treatments for that but one of the best ones is to expand your natural lung capacity with gradual-paced, regular cardiovascular exercise, going slowly until you can push yourself harder...\n\nIf it isn't a breathing issue, you may want to ask about synecope (pronounced sin-EH-coh-pee).  This is what happens when your blood pressure is in the low end of the normal range, and changes in your bodily posture end up causing sudden drops in upper-body blood pressure (do you get dizzy if you have to get up *straight* to your feet in the morning from your bed?

I have felt the great effects of improved mood from the sun, and I have read a lot about the large amount of vitamin D that the skin produces from the sun.\n\nBut is is one heck of a moisturizer.\n\nBe sure to get the organic kind, like a health food store has."
"2","Can someone/anyone describe 'Electricity'?","","Electricity is a property of matter that results from the presence or movement of electric charge. Together with magnetism, it constitutes the fundamental interaction known as electromagnetism. Electricity is responsible for many well-known physical phenomena such as lightning, electric fields and electric currents, and is put to use in industrial applications such as electronics and electric power."
"2","Evaluate the integral. Use Integration by Parts.?","The integral of  t sin2t dt. \n\nPlease show your work...Thanks. :)","The integration by parts formula is:\nintegral(f'g) = fg - integral(fg').\nIf we make f' = sin2t and g = t, then that second integral will only involve sin, and it should make everything easier.\nSo, that means f = -0.5cos2t, and g = t. Then g' = 1, so we get:\nintegral(t sin 2t) = -0.5tcos2t - integral(-0.5cos2t * 1)\nThat last integral now just becomes -0.25sin2t.\nSo the answer is -0.5tcos 2t + 0.25sin2t (+c)."

"1","Why does church take some books so offensively if, sometimes, they are fiction?","","I think the church has a lot of different motivations for why they take offense to certain books.  There is the simple offense, where people deem certain content inappropriate because it is morally questionable.  For example, a group of parents discover a book that includes violence or sex inappropriate for their children and want to protest or boycott to have the offensive content removed.  The motivation is straight forward not surreptitious.  The solution is to restrict expose for the children you are responsible for, but it is extreme to try to decide what is appropriate for other people.  The second reason is not so pure.  The church may fear the challenge of different ideas.  They may feel that it weakens their power or control over people and situations.  Case in point, literature that is pro-birth control or not anti-abortion may be banned by the church because it challenges what they say and they may loose control over people when individuals read the information and become educated by the information.  The church used to only allow the Bible to be translated into Latin so that only a select few could read it and they would only share ideas that they wanted people to be exposed to.  This gave them control to manipulate the masses; it robbed people of their right to make their own decisions and to educate themselves.  I believe the church still engages in this practice and it is manifested in the church becoming offended and banning."
"3","Re: Cough Medicines?","I recently read that teenagers these days use cough medicine for a ""high"".  Has anyone else heard this?  It is pretty scary what teens will do today!","Yes it sure is! There are a number of items in the household you wouldn't think would be harmful or a threat. But in this day and age it's unbelievable the extremes kids will go through to get high. Some measures are even used as 'games'.  There is a game call the pass out game. It's where you hang yourself until the point you pass out, however some have lost their lives doing this. I don't find these games fun, nor amusing. Parents need to be aware of what your children are doing! You can NEVER be too cautious!! \nIf you have teens you need to keep meds locked up in a cabinet that only you can access. This might seem a little extreme. Also if you talk with your teen regarding the dangers of any of the activities you have a good chance of preventing a disaster from occurring.

You can go to the pharmacist and get lice treatment, however these are extremely hard on the hair and can only be used once every week.  Lice are becoming resistant to these treatments as well!  There are a few remedies that you can whip up at home and can be used daily if needed. One is a mineral oil and vinegar treatment, another is mayo treatment, also lice don't seem to like an ingredient in tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner.  Make sure that you buy a nit comb tho for the stubborn eggs, do make sure the whole house is cleaned, and bedding, toys etc are cleaned as well.  By simply throwing bedding, etc in a dryer on the high heat setting for at least a 1/2 hour it should kill the bugs.  Look on the net for recipes for treatment the natural way or simply go talk to a public health nurse for information, they should have recipes onhand!!

"3","Best and easiest lice removal, preferably without pesticides.?","","The easiest way that I found for getting rid of the problem when my kids brought them home from school, was to use hair conditioner. I washed their hair thoroughly. After it had dried completely, I applied hair conditioner to it until it was saturated.(The type for dry hair is best, any brand.) Than I combed the hair with a fine toothed comb, (you can buy them especially for this purpose) and let it dry again. Don't remove the conditioner. Put your kids hair in braids or cut it short until this is over. Reapply the conditioner every time you wash your child's hair. You should not see any more adult lice as they will die on hatching if you have put enough conditioner on the hair. Comb frequently to get rid of the nits on the hair. If the hair is hard to comb, add more conditioner. Once the lice problem is finished with (about 2 weeks), every time you wash your children's (or your own) hair, put conditioner on before the final rinse. It makes the hair shaft too slippery for adult lice to attach their nits. Worked for me. I only had the problem once, with my kids. I was given this bit of advice by a friend who was a hair stylist."

Where can I find information about it???","1)  Christianity was NOT the first religion.  \n2)  Judaism was technically not the first religion, either.  Judaism did not come about until Moses.  While God was worshiped before Moses, as we read in the Bible, there was no formal religion.  Adam, Noah, Joshua, etc., had no formal religion as we typically think of; therefore, when Pagans claim that their religion is the oldest, technically they are correct, and the Bible confirms it.\n3)  Other religions start for various reasons.  L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology) and Joseph Smith (Mormonism) seemed to be financially motivated.  Islam seemed to be more racially motivated.  Most New Age and modern Pagan beliefs seem to be motivated by the desire to BE God (they desire ""special power"").  That is really what almost all false beliefs (including most false religious sects) are about...  getting to be God.  Deciding for one self what is right and wrong.  Wanting to be like God.  That is what Satan tempted Eve with in the Garden, and that is what drives us away today."

What do you think would be found?","Well, I don't know if you meant Universe's or a Gaalaxy, but assuming you meant Universes...\n\nThe word Universe is used to to describe the entire physical world. Meaning everything that is in space, every planet, star, comet, etc. is all part of the Universe.\n\nWhat some physicists have speculated, is that there may be ""alternate universes"". Universes that we cannot see because they are in different dimensions then we are. \n\nWe live in a four dimensional world. We have the three dimensions of 1. up an down, 2. right and left, 3.back and forth, and 4. time. \n\nIt is hard to comprehend extra dimensions, but some physicts have speculated that the extra dimensions may be incredibly small, and every time we move, we push them aside, but not into them.\n\nIt get's rather complicated, but this theory is used in some modern physics theories, such as String Theory.\n\nWe cannot access alternate universes even if they do exist, because we do not live in those dimensions. So as far as we know, the answer is no.\n\nYou also have to realize how incredibly vast space is. Astronomers use ""light-years"" to measure distance in space. 1 light-year is the distance light would travel in 1 earth year. That is a very, very large distance. So it is difficult to send spacecraft anywhere far even in our own universe.\n\nI am no expert though, and would reccomend searching wikipedia.org for answers.\n\nGood luck!"
"1","Which religion has the most ""Soldiers of God"" ?","","Islam and Christianity both have a history of using religion to justify violence, ethnic cleansing, and war.  I would find it hard to claim one is more bloody than the other.\n\nOf course, Islamic extremists would justify the perception that jihad - ""holy war"" makes Islam the religion with the most ""soldiers of god"" today.\n\nBut looking back in history, Christianity was used to justify the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and colonization and ethnic cleansing of Native Americans.\n\nBoth religions are just as bloody.  And I would probably say that Christianity has been used to justify the deaths of more people than Islam.  Terrorists pluck off a few at a time, maybe a thousand in a big attack.  Wars fought by Christians killed many, many more."

"2","How does ionic radius affect the solubility of a salt?","","It determines the number of ligands the ion can be surrounded with, both in the crystal and in solution. (Electronic configuration dictates the likely geometry.)\n\nThere is no direct correlation. Stability of the salt depends among other factors from the ionic character of the salt - some of the badly soluble sulfides have bonds with covalent character.\n\nThe energy gain from dissolving the salt (allowing free movement of formerly ordered crystals) has to be greater than the energy required to leave the crystal. Usually the ionic ligands in the salt crystal are replaced by water molecules."
"3","how many calories a day should a 14 year old teen have daily?","im 5'2 a little bit of a belly im trying to lose im 115 pounds and not very muscualer also will people lose more wieght on a low calorie diet or a low fat diet","If you are trying to lose fat, you want both a low fat and low cal diet. Don't count on losing weight if you exercise though because you are likly to put on more pounds than you lose. \n\nIt takes around 500 calories to burn off one pound of fat, but fat is the last reserve of your body, so it takes a lot to get to it. \n\nTo get an estimate of how much you burn each day, consider that if you did nothing but sit, with some minimal walking, you would burn about 2000 calories. If you do the same thing, except for getting about 2 hours of heavy exercise, you'll burn about 3000 calories. You need about 2500 calories a day to avoid being hungery and to stay healthy.\n\nSo, a smart diet (around 2500 calories), and more than an hour of exercise daily, and you should slowly start seeing a difference. Don't expect it to go fast though. It takes about 3 months for your body to adjust to major changes in diet and exercise, and get to peak preformance."

Since bovine insulin might have some slow virus contamination, this would be a conservative recommendation to avoid any possible cow products of any kind."

"2","How and why do lava lamps work?","This is for my Science NCEA level, so I really need as many different reasons as possible, and not the stuff from Wikipedia, as I've alreadt got that.","The lamp consists of an illuminating bulb, and a glass bottle containing a transparent liquid, translucent wax, and a metallic wire coil. The glass bottle sits on top of the bulb, which heats its contents. The metallic wire coil is hidden in the base of the lamp, which the glass bottle is sitting on.\n\nThe wax is slightly denser than the liquid at room temperature, and slightly less dense than the liquid under marginally warmer conditions. This happens because the wax expands more than the liquid when heated.\n\nThe light bulb heats the container at the bottom, and due to heat exchange with the atmosphere, the container eventually dissipates the introduced heat. This method of heat transfer is called convection.\n\nWax at the bottom heats until it melts, and eventually becomes less dense than the liquid above it. At this time, a portion of the wax rises towards the top of the container. Near the top, away from the heat source, the wax cools, contracts, and as its density increases it begins to fall through the liquid towards the bottom of the container again. The difference in temperature between the top and bottom of the globe is only a few degrees.\n\nOne mass of wax may rise as another falls. The metal coil at the bottom helps to overcome the surface tension of the individual wax droplets, causing the descending blobs to agglomerate into a single molten wax mass at the bottom of the container. The cycle of rising and falling wax droplets continues so long as the bottom of the container remains warm and the top of the container remains cool. Operating temperatures of lava lamps vary, but are normally around 60 °C (140 °F). If too low or too high a wattage bulb is used in the base, the ""lava"" ceases to circulate, either remaining quiescent at the bottom (too cold) or all rising to the top (too hot).\n\nChaotic behaviour makes the movement of the wax unpredictable—hence lava lamps can aid in the generation of one-time pads for cryptographic use.\n\nThe colour of the wax and the liquid often varies and can be found in many different combinations."

"2","what is really in the bermuda triangle?","","Under the ocean floor all over the world, there are pockets of Methane. When this methane erupts and bubbles to the surface, it lowers the density of the water, causing a floating ship to sink instantly to the bottom of the column of gas and water and into the hole from where the gas emerged. When the sand settles, it settles into the hole, back over the ship, so no wreckage is found.\n\nAs for planes, the column of methane travels skyward, lowering the density of the air, and the same principle applies, complete with a quick trip to the bottom and a watery grave. No wreckage.\n\nThe Bermuda Triangle has twice the methane deposits of the rest of the world.\n\nJust a theory, but what do you think?\n\nkeptcompany@yahoo.com"

"1","Are people basically good or evil and why do you think this is so?","","I think that all people are good. For some reasons some of them follow the good some others evil or bad. It deppens on their life, religion, mind, education e.t.c Theories of goodness inquire into what sorts of things are good, and what the word ""good"" really means in the abstract.\nAll religions and most philosophical movements have been concerned with good to some degree. It can define ""good"" and ""bad"" for a community or society. It affects everyone's life, and maybe all life on Earth, in the way people organize themselves in societies, and even how they think.\n\nThe duality of 'good versus evil' is expressed, in some form or another, by many cultures. This concept describes a hierarchy of moral standards applied to human behaviour. In more casual  use, the word ""evil"" can characterize people and behaviours that are hurtful, ruinous, or disastrous. Those who believe in the duality theory of evil believe that evil cannot exist without good, nor good without evil, as they are both objective states and opposite ends of the same scale.\n\nIn modern slang, ""bad"" has become a synonym for ""good"", as in ""Man, that's a bad piece of music.""  The ability to choose between good and evil is also a major theme of the philosophy. \nIn our life we have this abbility and we try to follow the better way. Usually our good is not your good.\nIf you want to learn more see Wikipedia"

"2","where does the sky end and space begin?","","The earth's atmosphere does not abrubtly stop.  It gradually gets thinner and thinner.  For example, satellites in low earth orbits -- arguably in ""space"" -- experience much more drag than satellites in higher, geosynchronous orbits.  So, you just have to define a distance as the edge of the sky and the beginning of space.  Here is a commonly accepted definition; read the rest of the article by following the link:\n\n""The Kármán line is an internationally designated altitude commonly used to define outer space. According to definitions by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the Karman or Kármán line lies at a height of 100 km (about 62 miles) above Earth's surface (ie. in technical terms 100 km above mean sea level). It was named after Theodore von Kármán.\n\nAround this altitude the Earth's atmosphere becomes negligible for aeronautic purposes, and there is an abrupt increase in atmospheric temperature and interaction with solar radiation...."""
"1","Why is agnosticism the fastest growing ""Religion"" in the world?","Objective reasons only, please. No sermons.","I am sorry you have received some really harsh answers to this question.  I believe your answer can be found in the definition of agnosticism.  \n\nThe doctrine that certainty about first principles or absolute truth is unattainable and that only perceptual phenomena are objects of exact knowledge. \n\nThe belief that there can be no proof either that God exists or that God does not exist.\n\nAsk yourself one more question, especially in regards to the root of all churches, the Catholic Church.  What is it they claim their Holy Trinity to be?  He or They are the answer to all questions.  The beginning to understanding and the end to suffering.  This to me is a wonderful belief to hold.  It gives some a sense of comfort.  However, this belief for many is difficult to understand given scientific reasoning, current global situations, and the reputation of the Christian faith.\n\nAgnostics are easy to equate in this manner.  Say you had been blind your entire life, and all your life everyone told you the sky was blue.  You would form this idea of an unidentified ""blue.""  Then one-day science comes along with a cure for your ailment.  The first thing you want to see is the sky.  When you look at it, it looks nothing like your idea of ""blue.""  Had you been wrong your entire life?  No.  Your concept of the idea of ""blue"" has no shifted from an idea to a reality.  Same thing with agnostics.  They have an idea of a higher power.  Yet since they have not physical proof of this power, it remains an idea.  Nothing more than that.\n\nI hope this helps."

I'm so confused.","OK, first let's try to figure out the arctan part.  Arctan(-1) means the angle whose tangent is -1, right?  And the tangent is the sine divided by the cosine.  So you're looking for angles whose sines and cosines are equal, but with opposite signs.  They point out to the right and down, or out to the left and up, at 45-degree angles.  That means the angles are 135 degrees and 315 degrees, or 3pi/4 and 7pi/4 radians.\n\nNow, the question asked you to find the sines of these two angles.  The sine of 3pi/4 is sqrt(2)/2, and the sine of 7pi/4 is -sqrt(2)/2.  So your answer is +/- sqrt(2)/2."

That's a good point about destructive interference.  I hadn't thought about that.  However, from what I understand, there should be gravity waves generated by two co-orbiting large bodies.  If you think about it, their gravity would increase and decrease if that was the case, but always remain far above zero.  So....if you could cancel it with a gravity wave generated by another source that was identical and just out-of-phase, you should still have a baseline gravity that was nonzero.  \n       In other words, no negative gravity (that I know of) so when it cancels, it's not zero."

"2","Why we see stars in black and white, not living color  ????","","The color of the star as we perceive it depends on two factors: the intrinsic color of the star and the sensitivity of the human eye. The star can have all kinds of colors from dull red (the coolest stars) via yellow and green to blue (the hottest stars). However, our eye is evolved in the light of the sun and is most sensitive to yellow.\n\nThe result is that we perceive most stars as white, with a few exceptions. Some stars look red, bluish? For instance in the constellation Orion, Betelgeuse is a bright red star at the top left corner, and Rigel is the bright blue star at the bottom right corner. You may want to use binoculars to see the colors more clearly."

The mesophyll cells are between the bundle-sheath cells and the leaf surface, and are rather loosely arranged.\n\nI think the answers are slightly weird, because the Calvin cycle is only occurring in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath. The reason that C4 plants are more efficient is that the mesophyll cells incorporate carbon dioxide into organic compounds, effectively pumping carbon dioxide into the bundle sheath, which keeps the carbon dioxide concentration in the bundle-sheath cells high enough for the Calvin cycle to function properly.\n\nIn any event, the answer is definitely not A, B, or D."

Assuming uniform density p, we have M(r) = (4/3)*Pi*r^3*p, so a(r) = G*(4/3)*Pi*r*p. If we let k = G*(4/3)*Pi*p, which is a constant, we get the ubiquitous equation a(r) = k*r, or d^2r/dt^2 = k*r, which we all know the solution to as the simple harmonic oscillator r(t)=A*cos(Sqrt[k]*t + B) where in our case A is the radius of the Earth and B=0.\nTo complicate matters, due to the presence of some pretty dense air, it will be necessary to add dampening conditions to the differential equation, giving a damped oscillator.\nAlso, the Earth is spinning and since the ball is not rigidly connected to it, it experiences a Coriolis ""force"" towards the tunnel walls in addition to its oscillation, which will surely cause it to at least stop prematurely.\nIt is more likely the ball will be destroyed by hitting the sides of the tunnel at high velocity. ;)"

It's something I think about quite a lot. Where I come from to work is kind of a privledge and a pain in the ass at the same time, but taxes do take a sizeable chunk out of anyone's income. People on a benefit admittedly do not receive a large income, but it's a pain in the ass when they say that they should be on one because ""boo hoo"" they are a single parent or whatever. And when the people who are working and basically, apart from all the rest of it, paying for them through their taxes, quite possibly have things which they could choose to say ""boo hoo"" about also.

A friend of mine explained her experience to me. She discribed it as a solid black figure, tall, standing on her stair case. She also explained it as wearing a cape (later on I found out that it is common for shadow people to be discribed as hooded) I had at the time never heard of anything like this before. Then a few months later another friend brought it up... this time he knew something about them. After that I did my own research... The stories check out... but the question remains- What are they? Most interestingly they are a relitively recent phenomenon. I am thinking that they are something quite separate from ghosts... I have never heard of someone being physically harmed by a shadow person.. but people do find them terrorfying. Who knows what they are!

"3","I have migranes that are killing me have seen specialist & nothing much has been done, how do i help myself?","","My migraines (fairly infrequent, thank GOD) are caused mainly by massive stress, flashing lights, or lack of sleep.  What you should really do is keep a headache diary - this is how I narrowed down my triggers.  Keep a notebook by your bed and every night before you go to sleep make a note of what you ate, your stress level, how you're sleeping, anything out of the ordinary.  You may find common threads.\n\nAs for while you're suffering - for me the trick is catching it early.  I have to take some sort of analgesic when I start getting the tunnel vision and the metallic taste in my mouth or I'm in for a world of hurt later.  If I don't catch it in time then keeping my hands extra-warm seems to help.  (I don't know why - I just go with what works.)\n\nMy best to you - I feel your pain.

I flew over there to visit, about 7 years ago...and everywhere I went, I met the most awesome people!  Australia was originally a penal colony, a place where England/Great Britain sent their convicts.  The Australians are a people founded on that, and many spend years tracing their roots, hoping to find that one of their ancestors WAS a convict.  They've taken that penal colony, and made it into a really great country, with the openess and democracy of American combined with the strength, fortitude and resolve of the Brits.  They're a strong, proud people, and if you ever get the chance to visit....you'll be like me, and not want to go home!  They share a dual-citizenship status with America, unlike Britain, who doesn't.  Every year, there are around 500 Americans who become Australian citizens and spend the rest of their lives there.  The country is beautiful, and you can be in the mountains one minute, and an hour later, be lazing on the beach!  They embrace the Aborigine culture, and you see it wherever you go in artwork, in names of cities, towns, streets, etc. (Wollongong, Parrametta, Coolangotta).  Their towns and cities and highways are clean, trash-free, and while there, I went through all areas of Sydney, and saw NO slums, NO graffiti, NO homeless, NO crime.  One of the friendliest nations in the world, and well worth the money spent to visit, if you get the chance!  And my having a southern accent (from Georgia in the US) seemed to be so cool to them! :)"

Why did her headache stump doctors? Why should one spend money to get  tests done if one is going to be sent home with over the counter drugs?","Headaches can have different causes, naming them is not the scope of this forum.  The role of a physician is to determine the cause of the headache.  If the headache's cause is an underlying disease (for example, high blood pressure, sinus infections, tumors, etc), then, that is what one treats.  If it is determined that is a migraine, then you treat it as a migraine.  Most of the time headaches have no organic cause and have no specific therapy other than pain medications.  Our role as MD's is to discover the cause of the headaches.  If there is none, then you treat the pain. It has nothing to do with being ""stumped"".  Your family member should be glad that the tests done are normal and she does not have an underlying dangerous illness."

The wear and tear on my left hip for my life has caused me to wear out my cartilage and now have arthritis.  I have hip pain on most days.  I am very active, workout 5 days a week, bike ride, etc.  I am 37 andhaven't heard of too many people my age having hip replacement.  I will definetely need it at some point, now or later is up to me.","It sounds as though you are still active.  Some considerations to make regarding your acitivity include lessening your impact with your physical fitness...changing to biking and swimming  as opposed to running or jogging...eating a well-balanced diet that included plenty of water and avoids caffiene and alcholol (dehydrates your body).  When you find that even with these modifications that your acitivty is still limited, then it is a good time to consider joint replacement.  \n\nJoint replacements continue to improve in technology and technique and I imagine they will only continue to improve.  Some surgeons now perform the minimally invasive technique which only requires about a 4 to 6 inch scar and usually only requires an overnight hospital stay.  Pain and recovery time is lessened with this technique, but not all candidates qualify for this approach.  \n\nIf you are at the point where you cannot carry on your normal acitivities and are having a cosultation for a hip replacement, don't let anyone tell you that you are ""too young""...yes, you will probably need a revision(s) in the future...but better to do it when you are younger rather than put it off another 20 years until you are so disabled that you've lost all your strength, cannot exercise, have developed a heart condition, have become obese due to lack of exercise, etc.  \n\nThere are people your age who undergo hip replacement, but it is rare.  When it limits your acitivities even with the modifications listed above, that's the time to consider it...otherwise, let the technology continue to progress!"
"3","Can you identify one case of death with irrefutible evidence that second-hand smoke was the cause?","Clearly, smoking cigarettes is not a healthy choice.  Many long time smokers have developed lung cancer.  However, many long time smokers never developed any cancer, and lived a long life. Likewise, some lung cancer victims have never smoked.  This is obviously not conclusive scientific evidence that second-hand smoke caused their ailment.  Could it be possible that there is either a genetic predisposition that puts people at risk regardless of their exposure to cigarette smoke, or perhaps some other factors that can trigger the onset of lung cancer?\nSide Note:  Most non-smokers are understandably offended by the pungent odor of cigarette smoke.  And, like any other undesireable circumstance, exposure should be avoidable.  It is common sense and common courtesy to be aware of one's surroundings, to avoid adverse situations and be considerate of others around you.","NO"
"3","Does anyone know a home remedy for shingles???? Goin Crazy Here! Help?","","Capsaicin cream or ointment. Capsaicin is the chemical in red pepper responsible for heat \nCayenne or red pepper is not the only ""herbal"" remedy which appears to be somewhat effective. The homeopathic remedies developed for Shingles are numerous. For example, Arsenicum album can be taken if the pain of the blisters seems to be relieved by heat and if the pain is worse at night. Iris versicolor is often helpful with shingles infection that is accompanied by gastro-intestinal problems and bumps which appear on the abdomen. If the patient is restless and the rash is itchy rather than burns, Rhus Toxicodendron can be taken in a low potency. All three of these remedies, though many claim to have found them helpful, have never been clinically tested. These remedies are probably best used in conjunction with other types of treatment\n\n\nA tea or hot compress can be made from Saint Johns Wort and Lavender, both of which are thought to be good restoratives for the nervous system . The reason that Saint Johns Wort is thought to help is that it contains compounds that act as manomire-oxidase enzyme inhibitors. A warm lotion made from the flowers and leaves may also relieve the burning of the Shingles blisters"
"3","What is immune system?","","The immune system is the system of specialized cells and organs that protect an organism from outside biological influences. (Though in a broad sense, almost every organ has a protective function - for example, the tight seal of the skin or the acidic environment of the stomach.) When the immune system is functioning properly, it protects the body against bacteria and viral infections, destroying cancer cells and foreign substances. If the immune system weakens, its ability to defend the body also weakens, allowing pathogens, including viruses that cause common colds and flu, to grow and flourish in the body. The immune system also performs surveillance of tumor cells, and immune suppression has been reported to increase the risk of certain types of cancer."

With the help of Richard Simmons ""Sweatin to the oldies"" 3 times a day and slimfast, I got down to 220 in a matter of 6 months - I was getting all my vitamins and minerals from the slimfast, and when It said to eat a sensible dinner, that's exactly what I did. My stomach shrunk from the size of a basketball down to the the size of my fist (for the first time in years). I met the man of my dreams when I was 19, got pregnant 2 months later, and since then, I have had 3 Children, back to back - they are 8months, 1 1/2, and 2 1/2, so of course, i gained ALL of my weight back, because I used the excuse of being pregnant, to eat all I wanted. Now, I'm paying for it!! I've decided it's time to take control of my life - Im just wondering if it is possible to lose 150 - 200 lbs in 1 year? Not by taking silly pills, but by exercising and such?? You guys are so great and have awesome advice, so I decided I would ask!! Looking for insperation as well :o)","I've gained some weight also from having kids.  I had my daughter when I was 23, I gained about 100 pounds and I lost all but about 30 pounds.  Two years ago, I had a son and I got down to 206, I'm 6'1.  Then when he was 9 months old, I got pregnant with twins.  I gained alot of weight.  I lost most and now I weigh about 225.  I joined LA weight loss in Febuary and my goal is to get down to 190 by my 30th birthday in July.  It is so hard to lose weight especially after childbirth.  It really changes your body.  With 8 month twins, two year old, seven year old and a four year old step son it is soo hard to exercise.  I would you try slimfast again.  If it worked so well the first time, try it again.  I ordered the exercise glider and it should be coming in the mail soon.  It's only twenty dollars and I ordered it off the internet.  It's these things you put under your feet and you slide to these dvd's that they send you.  I also ordered some diet pills called hoodia 911.  I know you said no diet pills but look them up on the internet, they are suppose to be healthy for you.  They were on  20/20 and Oprah.  I said I wasn't going to buy anymore diet pills, but I seen these and decided to try these.  I guess it is possible to lose that much weight in a year, you done it!!!  What not try that same approach?  I know your body has changed over the years with childbirth.  Email me and share your diet progress.  I would love to see how you do.  We can share with each other."

"2","If we evolved from monkeys, how come monkeys themselves didn't evolve and we still have monkeys on this earth?","I'm not being creationist, but I was thinking the other day about how we came to be. If we evolved from monkeys and we share 99% of our genes with apes (I think), then how is it we evolved into humans and they got 'stuck' as monkeys?!","Sorry to be picky, but we didn't evolve from monkeys, we evolved from apes!\n\nModern monkeys aren't the same as our and their common ancestors, they have evolved too! They've just changed in different ways to adapt to their environment. Evolution has made them very well adapted to living in trees, e.g. long prehensile tails and both ""hands"" and ""feet"" that can grip. Note that humans don't have these marvellous adaptations!\n\nWe got bigger brains, tool-making and language skills, and the ability to walk upright, which enabled us to thrive in environments that monkeys would struggle to survive in. But you try living in a tree and eating bananas all day and see how well adapted you are to that! Evolution has just treated us differently, that's all."

"2","Why are fruits mostly roung/round-ish?","Is there a reason why fruits are in general a round or round type shape?","The main purpose of plants having fruits is to reproduce. So fruits are generally round so that it will roll a longer distance when it's ripped and drop from the tree. This ensures that the fruit will have a higher chance of survival."
"1","Why do believers of god feel the need to force their beliefs on others?","I know not all of them do, but most of the people who believe in god that I have encountered say ""If you don't serve god you, serve the devil."" I belive in freedom of religion. And I don't have one. Why is that such a bad thing for religious people? Same with people who believe in the devil. They say the same thing. Why is religion such an important thing? It only seperates different religious people. This is the same as racism in a sense. Racism is when you think one race is better than the other and with religion believers of god believe they are better than people who dont have a religion. I don't understand how they are better if they are like this. Religion should be a choice, not a neccesity. Noone should have to be told what they belive in. Why does the USA revolve around god? They right IN GOD WE TRUST on money and make you swear to god in court. I don't have anything against people with a religion, but it bothers me that they try to force it on others.","God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to."

"1","How do you decide on what topics you do not want to ignorant in and topics you would like to stay uninformed?","","To me, I think that we should all be informed of all topics.  This keeps people from being as ignorant, and keeps conversations lively.  Not only that, but if you stay uninformed, then you let someone else make a decision for you.  If you choose not to know about a president, then you are either being narrow minded or letting someone else choose who will be our next president for you.  In the end, you should not have to decide."

Typically Plant managers should be very knowledgeable about their plant processes (hence the need to understand chemical engineering) and be a good administrator.  \n\nUnfortunately, some senior management thinks that if you are good engineer that you'll make a good administrator.  This is not true as good administration involves a clear understanding of business practices.  Therefore an MBA together with a ChE degree would position you for plant manager.\n\nHope this helps"

So I refuse to be near them. So ... Am I going to die? Help?","It sounds like you need to take a trip to the health department and talk to a nutritionist. \n\nYou can take a vitamin, but most of the time they don't absorb very well.  \n\nIt's alot better to just eat your vegetables.  You probably feel like crap.  You should definitely get a colon cleanse, and start drinking alot of water.  Eating mainly meat isn't that great for you -- especially when you're eating meat that has toxins.  It's mildly okay if it's not your mainstay.  But if it's pretty much all you eat (with some carbs thrown in) then your body will collect all the pesticides, antibiotics, etc. that the animals were exposed to and that was concentrated in their bodies.  So now it's getting concentrated in you.\n\nDefinitely do a colon cleanse.  Start excercising.  \nTake your vitamins.  Drink lots of water.  And look into veggie burger type stuff to replace some of what you're eating.  Also, try replacing some of the meat with beans.\n\nYou can eat veggies and have them taste good.  You just have to experiment.  I'm a vegetarian, but there are alot of vegetables I don't like.  \n\nI'm a sweet tooth.  You might like this, I call it ""sweet salad"".\n\nI take :1/2 cup of spinach\n        halved grapes\n        almonds, walnuts, or pecans\n        cherry tomatoes \n        another random fruit around the house\n        dried apricots\n        local honey\n\nI mix it all together.  I don't really like spinach that much, but it's got so many more vitamins (and more Vitamin A -- Beta Carotene) than even carrots have, I've found that honey is sweet, satisfying, and makes it tolerable.  \n\nSo experiment.  I've found ways, and you can find yours.\n\nIt's worth improving your lifestyle to improve your health.  You have to live with your body for the rest of your life -- take care of it."

I never got the white-ish discharge or anything... but there is kinda a bad smell down there... Also.. my period is over 3 weeks late... and this has never happened...\n\nShould i be worried?? I mean i know, i should treat it, but i told my mother it was itchy down there and she was like.. Have u been washing it? i, of course, answered yes.. then she said something about how maybe im allergic to something? she had to go.. and i havnt asked anything since then... What could be causing my period to not happen? What would happen if i didnt treat this yeast infection??\n\nI read on a medical site, that when ur period comes, it raises the PH, which treats the yeast infection.. which is why i didnt take any further action..but now my period hasnt come?","Funny how two males answered first when you asked them not to.\n\nOK - yeast is only one kind of infection you could get.  Different ones can cause different kinds of discharge, and/or different kinds of smells.  Many of them can cause itching.\n\nI really do think you should see a nurse or doctor about this. \n \nBut until you do:\n- always wipe from front to back so you don't get bacteria from your anal area in your vaginal area\n- wash daily.  Use only the most basic of soap (or none if you might be sensitive).  Washing morning and night is OK too.\n- DO NOT use a douche - if you have unfriendly bacteria it can push it further up inside you and cause infection there\n(for now, I'd avoid using tampons for the same reason)\n- try to wear cotton, not polyester or nylon underwear\n- if using a pantyliner, try for one with a cottony feel, not a plastic-like weave on the covering\n- don't wear jeans or pants that are tight against your crotch  (""Camel toe"" is not an attractive look, anyway!  Nobody needs to see your ""M"".)\n\nAs for your period - you are young, and it's normal to have a period that isn't always regular in the first few years of menstruating.  But if if doesn't come soon, talk to your doctor. \n\nMine came anywhere from 4 -6 weeks apart when I was your age, but by age 18 I once skipped 8 or 9 months (I was a virgin too).  It turned out I had an imbalance of the various hormones that regulate different phases of the cycle.

"2","How does salt afffect the boiling point of water?","","To turn liquid water into steam the weak bonds between the molecules have to be broken and the molecules accelerated enough to leave the water surface and become vapour. This requires energy supplied by heating. \n\nNow add salt.\n\nThe salt consists of NaCl crystals. In water these dissolve into Na+ and Cl- ions. These ions will become surrounded by water molecules that are attracted to them, forming large clumps of molecules. To break these bonds requires more energy than in the case where the salt was absent.\n\nWe have to supply this extra energy and the result is boiling at a higher temperature."
"2","Who discovered the atom oxygen?","","Oxygen was first discovered by Michał Sędziwój, Polish alchemist and philosopher in late 16th century. Sędziwój assumed the existence of oxygen by warming nitre (saltpeter). He thought of the gas given off as ""the elixir of life"".\n\nOxygen was again discovered by the Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele sometime before 1773, but the discovery was not published until after the independent discovery by Joseph Priestley on August 1, 1774, who called the gas dephlogisticated air (see phlogiston theory). Priestley published his discoveries in 1775 and Scheele in 1777; consequently Priestley is usually given the credit. It was named by Antoine Laurent Lavoisier after Priestley's publication in 1775."

"3","How do I increase my weight?","Im 108lbs and would like to be atleaste 115 lbs. What are some things I could do to increase my body weight?","My answer is quite direct. First, make sure that your meals are balanced. Second, increase intake of carbohydrate and protein foods but not fatty foods! The reason is simply because once  carbohydrate and protein foods are consumed into the body, and the body has utilised them, the excess will be converted to fats and are stored in the body. However, if you were to consume fatty foods (since the word fatty suggests 'fats' and you would know that it gives 'fats' to the body), it is unhealthy to consume in excess. High in fatty foods can cause health problems like coronary heart disease, diabetes, etc. \n\nSo, I guess, if possible, you might want to consult a dietician for more tips and information.

But there is a debate about the safety of such measures for instance there are claims that it increases them risk of cancer. \nFluoridation: Benefits vs. Risks\nby Mark Bornfeld, DDS\n\nSince the early 20th century, the town of Hereford, in Deaf Smith County, Texas, was known as ""the town without a toothache"". Public health officials searched for a reason why this town had rates of dental decay that were significantly lower than average. It took nearly 12 years (from 1933 to 1945) for researchers to conclude through epidemiologic studies that it was the high naturally occurring levels of fluoride in its water that was responsible for this salutary effect on the residents of this town. On January 25, 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan became the first city to intentionally introduce fluoride to its public water supply. Since that time, fluoridation of drinking water has become acknowledged by the Centers for Disease Control as one of the ten greatest public health accomplishments (see CDC / MMWR Report: Ten Great Public Health Achievements – United States, 1900-1999 at http://fluoride.oralhealth.org/papers/00056796.htm) Almost from the time of its introduction, however, the use of fluoride, especially in public water supplies, has been a topic of controversy. \n\nDespite some dissension on this issue by non-dentists (and a minority of dentists), most researchers believe the literature supports the purported benefits of the use of fluoride as a public health measure. (Not a scientific fact but an empirical observation: during the years that I maintained a practice in Lindenhurst, a small village in Long Island with demographics similar to those of my current practice in Brooklyn, I noticed an incidence of dental decay MANY orders of magnitude greater than that encountered in Brooklyn. The only factor which I could see to account for this difference was that Brooklyn was fluoridated and Lindenhurst was not.) I remain convinced of the value of fluoridation.\n\nFluoride can be applied to teeth in one of two ways: \nby application to the surface of the teeth (topically) through the use of fluoride-containing toothpastes, rinses, or professionally applied fluoride treatments, or \nsystemically, through fluoridation of drinking water or fluoride dietary supplementation. \nThe systemic application of fluoride is thought to benefit children whose teeth are still in the process of formation, because the fluoride introduced into the body can still be incorporated into the structure of the teeth. Since tooth enamel formation is generally completed by age 14 or 15, systemic fluoride is not thought to confer any benefit for those above this age. \n\nIn either method of application, fluoride becomes a part of the enamel structure. The main inorganic structural element of enamel, hydroxyapatite, becomes fluorinated: i.e., fluoride becomes an intrinsic part of its crystalline structure. This is postulated to combat decay by a combination of three possible mechanisms: \n\nEnamel becomes more resistant to softening by acid from decay-forming bacteria; \nEnamel develops an anti-bacterial quality, inhibiting growth of decay-forming bacteria; or \nEnamel develops a smoother surface that resists the accumulation of decay-forming bacterial plaque. \nRegardless of the mechanism or the efficacy of water fluoridation, its implementation required some assurance of safety, and therein lies the root of the controversy. Even before Jack D. Ripper declared (in the Stanley Kubrick movie Dr. Strangelove, 1964) that fluoridation was a ""Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids"", fluoridation ran into heavy opposition, and still does. Beyond the paranoia of the conspiracy theorists, there are legitimate questions that must be addressed, as they must for every therapeutic measure: do the benefits"

"3","How do I lose ""water weight"" quickly.  I need to lose about 1.5 inches in 3 days.?","I just started taking a diuretic supplement called Xpel.

The bottle says 6-8 glasses per day,  but the guy at the store told me to drink only about 40oz per day since I'm trying to lose 1.5 inches in 3 days.  I have heard that you have to drink more water to lose this water weight so your body doesn't think it's being depleted of water.  Please clarify what I should be doing.  Thanks in advance.","Losing water weight is actually not that difficult. But i'm not quite sure if losing water weight will make a substantial difference when it comes to losing inches. I was a wrestler in high school, and when i had to lose weight for the scales a day before a match, i used to put on about 5 sweatshirts on myself, and 2 shorts, a pair of jeans, 2 pairs of socks, and thick shoes on top of all this. Wearing these clothes i used to go out and run for atleast an hour to two hours, which reduced my weight for about 5lbs. Which was enough for me to help me with the scales at the match. But i've never known to losing inches when i lost water weight. Also, water weight comes back in a week after you lose it."

Do these things affect air travel or space flight? thanks... i need easy to understand details...","Well I do not think that the Mpemba effect depends on superheating or supercooling. Superheating is dangerous to try at home but probably needs distilled water. Supercooling is probably also hard to achieve at home and probably also should be done with distilled water. I do not know what hot ice is. \n\nThere are places on the web where you can read about the Mpemba effect, and lots of experiments to test this. I do not think you need distilled water to try it yourself, but since we do not really understand the Mpemba effect, it might work better with distilled water. That would be an interesting hypothesis to test. \n\nI do not think that the Mpemba effect has a huge effect on air travel or space flight. Supercooling has a big effect on air travel because supercooled moisture can suddenly cause ice on an airplane. I do not think it has much of an effect on space flight, except as the rocket or space vehicle is traveling through the atmosphere. \n\nThere appear to be a number of applications of superheating in aerospace engineering, in materials proecessing and fuel systems. A little web searching quickly reveals a huge number of sites associated with aerospace and superheating."
"1","Does Morality Depend Upon Religion?","Would like to know if Religion fosters morality or is morality inherant in human being?","Wow, what a great question.  Let's first see if we can 'agree' on what morality means.  The traditional definition is that morality means a system or set of beliefs that define what is good or bad.\n\nTo that end, religion and religious traditions, whether Eastern or Wester, certainly due provide a system of beliefs in what is right or wrong - or morality.\n\nThe real question, is this . . . which religious tradition (i.e., Judeo-Christian, Hindu, Islamic, etc.,) provides the ""best"" system for morality? To answer that question ones must become familiar with the sacred writing and teachings of a given relgious tradition.\n\nMust morality depnd on religion exclusively?  Not necessarily, but it is hard to think of one signficant moral tradition or belief (e.g., don't steal, don't kill) that is not rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition.\n\nI believe the statement that morality is relative is simply ridiculous.  Moral traditions created by man are relative; but the Judeo-Christian view is that God gave the Law and thus Judeo-Christian morality is based on the character and nature of God, which is anything but relative.  God is absolute, and the final authroity on what is true, good or not."
"2","what is helium? im doing a science project!?","for my science fair project.","Helium (from Greek Hêlios: god of the sun) is a chemical element; its atomic symbol is He. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and nearly inert monatomic that heads the noble gas series in the periodic table. Its atomic number is 2 and its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements. It exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions. Extreme conditions are also needed to create the small handful of helium compounds, which are all unstable at standard temperature and pressure. Its most abundant stable isotope is helium-4 and it has a rare stable isotope, helium-3. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two different states—helium I and helium II—is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the phenomenon of superfluidity) and those looking at the effects that near absolute zero temperatures have on matter (such as superconductivity).\n\nHelium is the second most abundant element in the known Universe and second lightest element in the periodic table. In the modern Universe almost all new helium is created as a result of the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth it is created by the radioactive decay of much heavier elements (alpha particles are helium-4 nuclei produced by alpha-decay).\n\nEvidence of helium was first detected on August 18, 1868 as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometres in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun, by French astronomer Pierre Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 line, for it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium, and concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. He and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (helios)."

Clusters can occur in families or among the institutionalized.  \n\nMost infested persons have no symptoms, and the worms cause few long-term problems.  Anal itching is the most common reported symptom (occasionally scratching can lead to excoriation in the area). Patients may also rarely have insomnia, irritability, anorexia, and weight loss.  \n\nHumans are the only host for this worm. Infestation is by fecal-oral route; ingested eggs hatch in the stomach and the larvae migrate to the colon where they mature.  Female worms migrate to the peri-anal skin at night, lay their eggs there, and die. The eggs cause itching; scratching causes egg deposition under fingernails, from where they can cause further contamination.\n\nThe medications typically used are Mebendazole and Pyrantel Pamoate.  Mebendazole is pregnancy category C (meaning that harmful effects are not fully known) and is CONTRAINDICATED in the first trimester of pregnancy.  Pyrantel Pamoate is probably safe in pregnancy, but you should seek the advice of your obstetrician before taking it."

"2","based on odds, how many hours might it take to shuffle a deck of cards back into order?","In order of number and suit, just as if you openned the deck for the first time. Also assuming that you aren't really trying to shuffle them into order. Based on the odds of this being a happenstance.","Shuffling is pretty complex as you probably mean a riffle shuffle or something like that.  But let's assume you're shuffling by spreading out all the cards on the table, and randomly picking them.\n\nAssuming you want the cards in a specific order, then for each card, you'd have to randomly select the ""right"" card.  For the first card, you have 52 to choose from, and a 1/52 chance of getting it right.  For the second card, you now have 51 to choose from and thus a 1/51 chance of getting it right...on down to the last card.\n\nSo your odds are:\n\n1/52 * 1/51 * 1/50 * 1/49 * ... * 1/3 * 1/2 * 1/1\n\nor 1/52! or about 1/8*10^69.

Dan Brown's book claims Jesus in not divine or God, and the gospels as we know them, have been changed, and after Jesus stay here on earth, men raised his status to the level of God. Could any of this be true?\n\nAncient secrets of the Church, hidden for centuries have actually been revealed and published in books prior to the fictional writings of Brown in the Da Vinci Code. Baigent and Leigh have produced other books from researchers point of view over the last two decades, including ""Dead Sea Scrolls Deception"", ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"", and ""Messianic Legacy."" These books were the talk of the religious communities when they came out in the early 90's and certianly they have fueled an ongoing interest into just exactly who was this man Jesus, what was his message and what happened to him?\n\nIslam claims to ""break the code"" so to speak, over 1,400 years ago. The answer, according to Muslm scholars has been in the Quran for over fourteen hundred years \n\nSome may be surprised to learn, Muslims believe in the miracle birth and other miracles associated with Jesus. They actually consider him as the ""Messiah"" and they even say, ""peace be upon him"" when mentioning his name. However, they are quick to negate any connection between God and Jesus as a partnership or God-head, and they rule out the notion of God having any son (or daughter for that matter).\n\nHere is how Muslim scholars present their understanding and ""break the code"": \n\nHow Muslim scholars ""broke the code"": \n\nCreation itself tells us there is a creator and from the beginning of time – Allah, (the One God in Arabic) alone is to be worshiped. This is clear teaching throughout the Old testament (Torah), the scriptures that Jesus himself read and taught from. God is one not one of three; for example: ‘He is God; there is no other besides Him’. (Deuteronomy 4:35). The same is mentioned in the book of Mark in the New Testament, chapter 12, verse 29, when Jesus, peace be upon him, had been asked about the Greatest Commandment he replied, ""To know, O Israel, the Lord your God is One Lord; and you have to love Him with all your heart and all your mind and all your strength.""\n\nAccording to the oldest and most authentic copies of manuscipts and scrolls available throughout the centuries, Jesus, peace be upon him, never claimed to be God, or the creator, or the One to pray to, nor did he tell his followers to revere him as God. These notions appear on the lips of others who came along decades and even centuries later. \n\nWhile Jesus was on earth he did not claim to be the creator or ask us to revere him as God. His miraculous birth is a sign of his prophethood: “Verily, the likeness of Jesus before Allah, is the likeness of Adam. He (Allah) created him from dust and said “Be!” and he was” (Quran 3:59). Like all the great and noble prophets of Allah such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, Isaac and David, Jesus came with one message: Worship, love, obey and submit to the one true God, Allah, the creator of everything and do not worship anything besides Allah.\n\nThroughout history, people have taken to worship things or people alongside Allah, or just worshiping something else like power, status or money. Even the names of religions seem have more to do with the creation and less or nothing to do with the Creator. For example: Buddhism – Buddha (the name of a man), Confucianism – Confucius (the name of a man), Hinduism – Hind (the name of an area), Judaism – Judah (the name of a tribe) and Christianity – Christ (the name of a great prophet).\n\nIslam is different. Islam is a word coming from the verb ""aslama"" and it carries the meaning of ""surrender"", ""submission"", ""obedience"", ""sincerity"" and ""peace"" between you and Almighty Alla"

They mate when its time but it isn't the same partner, are we not a superior being to animals? I just wanted to know what evolutionist believe when it comes to relating humans and animals. Again not criticizing just thoughts?","Some animals have only one partner their whole life (humans are more promiscuous than say penguins).\nSome animals live in society (some even are more organized than humans and do what they have to do).\nSome animals kill to eat (that includes humans).\n\nEvery animal behave according to their specie, so, it's a mistake to think a fish has to act like an ant, or that a human has to act like a lion. We are not vegetables, nor minerals, we are animals and animals do not behave like other animals of another specie.\n\nFear and anger are instincts. Try hitting someone and see if they'll be stoic waiting for your first and not even blink.\n\nWheter you believe in evolution or not, you can't deny instincts.

(ABS)?","I got an oright body, but i want noticeable abs, so when im walking on the beach and a hot chick stares at me, i dont want her to be thinking, damn he's hot... only if he had abs :D","First and foremost, stay away from any ab machine you see on TV as they are simply a waste of money and barely effective.\n\nThe abdominal muscles work just like any other muscle and have to be challenged as such. If you want muscular abdominals, you have to challenge them with resistance and good form just like you would your chest, your back or any other muscle for that matter. Targeting the correct energy system is imperative. This means you should never enter into the aerobic phase of this exercise, ideally keeping it under 2 minutes at most. \n\nThink of rolling a carpet and contracting fully on the top of the movement and squeeze. If you do them correctly, you shouldn't be able to do more than 30 crunches. Any more than that, and you're probably doing them half-azz, incorrectly or with a partial range of motion.\n\nFor the upper abs, focus on crunches which effectively work the abdominals better than sit-ups or any machine on the market.\n\nFor the lower abs, keep in mind there is very little muscle tissue there so decreasing levels of body fat is the most effective way to bring out the best in this area. Hanging leg raises, v-situps and reverse curls are among some of the best exercise for this region. Always make sure your pelvis curls up to maximize lower abdominal contraction during these exercises.\n\nAs far as fat loss and getting ripped goes, cardio, cardio, cardio. Abdominal exercises alone will never burn fat from your abdominal area. You must do cardiovascular exercise to accomplish this. Cardio is best in the morning, on an empty stomach at about 70-80% of your maximum heart rate for about 30-45 minutes. This combined with a common sense diet will quickly shed body fat so you can actually see those abs you've developed. \n\nI would encourage you to seek the advice and guidance of a personal trainer in your area for further education on these principles. Please ensure you start off at a very basic level for crunches and cardio if you are a beginner.\n\nHere's a good list of ab exercises:\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/Strength_Exercises_abdominals.html \n\n.\n."
"2","How age of fossils calculated?","","No, no, no!   It is *not* carbon dating!  This is a common misconception (happily encouraged by creationists).\n\nCarbon dating (or radiocarbon dating) is just one of *many* forms of radiometric dating (but only useful up to about 60,000 years ago and thus is practically useless for most fossils).\n\nAnd radiometric dating is just one of *many* forms of dating fossils and rocks.\n\nBesides radiometric dating, other methods are dendrochronology (matching tree rings in wooden artifacts), paleomagnetic dating (the reversals in the earth's magnetic field), ice cores, varves (counting layers of sedimentary deposits), superposition, stratigraphy, etc. etc.  All of these are good for dating overlapping time ranges ... and where the ranges overlap they confirm and calibrate each other.  (My first link under Sources gives a great overview of many of these different methods.)\n\nCarbon dating is used for dating once-living tissue like bones or wood (*not* fossils) and is very accurate, but only to about 50,000 to 60,000 years ago ... much younger than most fossils.  Why?  Because carbon-14 decays with a very short half-life of only 5,730 years (which is why it is so accurate).  For dating older artifacts like fossils, we use isotopes of radioactive materials that decay with a much longer half-life.  Each technique is named after an atom that decays at a known rate (half-life) into another atom.  For example, potassium-argon dating measures the decay of potassium-40 to argon-40 with a half life of 1.26 *billion* years.  There are literally dozens of other methods, and again, because they overlap, they all confirm and calibrate each other."
"1","Mormon High Priests grant salvation?","Doctrine & Covenants 68\n12 And of as many as the Father shall bear record, to you shall be given power to seal them up unto eternal life. Amen.\n\n15 Wherefore they shall be high priests who are worthy, and they shall be appointed by the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood, \n\nJoseph Smith said, ""The order of the High-Priesthood is that they have power given to them to seal up the Saints unto Eternal Life"" (October 1831 General Conference meeting in Orange, Ohio.)\n\nHow do Mormons invoke this power?  ...must be in the secret temple ritual somehow... shouldn't everyone know this, though?","according to #12 in your question, the power is given only to ""seal"" up to eternal life those persons identified by the God the Father, in otherwords, God is directing the process, and anything contrary to what He appoints doesn't count. - sealing is not really the same thing as granting salvation.  Salvation comes through the Lord.\n\nAs for temple rites, they are not secret.  They are SACRED.  that means very special and important, and of God - so they ought not to be spoken of carelessly.  everyone is welcome to go to the temple, as soon as they have prepared.\n\n[as for that stuff on tv, etc (that some individuals answering earlier have referred to) - please.  that stuff is so not true.  and the people perpetuating those false ideas know it.  and God knows it, and he knows they know it.\n\nif you want to learn about mormonism, inquire from current authorities in mormonism.  to use an analogy, what kind of information about american history or culture do you think you would get if, instead of talking to americans, you asked Al Qaida?  come on, now, people.]\n\nGod lives.  He is concerned about my welfare and yours, and wants us to do well and be happy.   He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to suffer and die on our behalf, and who was resurrected, so that we would have the opportunities of salvation.  Only through Christ we all will live again, and we can, if we follow him, obtain joy and happiness for eternity.\n\nBest Wishes on your journey."
"1","Going Crazy..?","I am a 27 year old male and a crossdresser. I am surprised to even find myself doing this.\nI feel stupid to say ""I dont know if im gay or not"". I have fantasies about men (being a girl and not), and got off to a few guys before. I've never actually had physical contact with another guy. If I find out I'm not, I will be devastated because I will have felt I was faking it all these years. WTF DO I DO? And please, It's not a sin for all the close-minded, just in case you'd like to know. I don't think people would kill themselves because of what they CHOOSE to be. Just makes sense to me. Thank you.","Dude, if you're going to be that explicit, don't be so vague in the title.  That was disgusting for me to read, and I didn't even finish the whole thing.  ""Going crazy?"" seems like something completely different.  \n\nLook, I'm not trying to trash you though.  Maybe you have vagina-envy.  If it feels natural, you should think about pursuing a sexual relationship with a man, and seeing.  Cross-dressing does not mean you are gay, but it definately doesn't mean that you're not.  You should find out yourself, because no one else can answer this for you and just accept yourself for whatever you are.  There's nothing wrong with being gay, and there's nothing wrong with being not gay.\n\nIf you find that simply fantasizing about being a woman(sorry hard for me to think about) and having men is all you like, and actually don't like being with a man, that's ok, too.  Keep on fantasizing if you like it.  You may find that you are a female trapped in a man's body.  There's no way to tell.  The reason for all the confusion is because you're telling yourself that you need to be a certain way, which is rubbish.  Thinking you need to be a certain way is purely influence and it's not natural.  We are what we are, and the only way to be wrong in what you are is living a lie.  Find the truth, and love it because the truth is beautiful, no matter what the truth is.  The truth will set you free.  This may be a cliche, but it's true.  \n\nKnow this;  Most things you believe to be a necessity, you find later to be unnecessary.  Mentally, be water and take the shape of whatever container you are.  You can do no wrong when you are honest."
"2","What is the distance in miles from the north pole to the south pole?","Please use around the earth not thru.","The pole of inaccessibility marks a location that is the most challenging to reach owing to its remoteness from geographical features which could provide access. The term is a geographic construct, not an actual physical phenomenon, and is of interest mostly to explorers and conspiracy theorists.\n\nNorthern Pole of Inaccessibility (84°03′N 174°51′W). Located on the Arctic Ocean pack ice at a distance farthest from any land mass. It is 661 km (411 statute miles) from the North Pole, 1453 km (903 mi) north of Barrow, Alaska, and equidistant from the closest landmasses, Ellesmere Island and Franz-Josef Land, 1094 km (680 mi) away. It was reached by Sir Hubert Wilkins in 1927 by aircraft. Due to the constant motion of the pack ice, no permanent structure exists at the pole. \nSouthern Pole of Inaccessibility (85°50′S 65°47′E). A spot on Antarctica at a point most distant from the surrounding ocean. It is located 463 km (288 statute miles) from the South Pole. The surface elevation is 3718 m (12,198 ft). It was reached in 1957 by a Soviet Antarctic Expedition for International Geophysical Year research work: see Pole of inaccessibility (Antarctic research station). Today a building still remains at this site, marked by a statue of Vladimir Lenin, and is protected as a historical site. Note that there are several possible definitions [1], depending on whether the ""coast"" is measured to the grounding line, or to the ice shelves. \nPacific Pole of Inaccessibility, also called Point Nemo (48°50′S 123°20′W) is the place in the ocean that is farthest from land.

"1","why do people celebrate Christmas if its not even mention in the bible?","","THE ORIGIN OF CHRISTMAS\n\nIt was not until several hundred years after Jesus lived on the earth that people began to commemorate his birth on December 25. But that was not the date of Jesus’ birth.\n\nConsider the weather conditions at that time of the year in Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The Jewish month of Chislev (corresponding to November/December) was a month with cold and rainy weather. The month after that was Tebeth (December/January). It saw the lowest temperatures of the year, with occasional snows in the highlands. Let us see what the Bible tells us about the climate of that region.\nThe Bible writer Ezra shows that Chislev was indeed a month known for cold and rainy weather. After stating that a crowd had gathered in Jerusalem “in the ninth month [Chislev] on the twentieth day of the month,” Ezra reports that people were “shivering . . . on account of the showers of rain.” Concerning weather conditions at that time of the year, the congregated people themselves said: “It is the season of showers of rain, and it is not possible to stand outside.” (Ezra 10:9, 13; Jeremiah 36:22) No wonder shepherds living in that part of the world made sure that they and their flocks were no longer out of doors at night when December came around!\nThe Bible reports, however, that shepherds were in the fields tending their flocks on the night of Jesus’ birth. In fact, the Bible writer Luke shows that at that time, shepherds were “living out of doors and keeping watches in the night over their flocks” near Bethlehem. (Luke 2:8-12) Notice that the shepherds were actually living out of doors, not just strolling outside during the day. They had their flocks in the fields at night. Does that description of outdoor living fit the chilly and rainy weather conditions of Bethlehem in December? No, it does not. So the circumstances surrounding Jesus’ birth indicate that he was not born in December.\n\nSo why was December 25 chosen? Some who later claimed to be Christian likely “wished the date to coincide with the pagan Roman festival marking the ‘birthday of the unconquered sun.’” (The New Encyclopædia Britannica) In winter, when the sun seemed weakest, pagans held ceremonies to get this source of warmth and light to come back from its distant travels. December 25 was thought to be the day that the sun began its return. In an effort to convert pagans, religious leaders adopted this festival and tried to make it seem “Christian.”\n\nThe pagan roots of Christmas have long been recognized. Because of its unscriptural origin, Christmas was banned in England and in some of the American colonies during the 17th century. Anyone who even stayed home from work on Christmas day had to pay a penalty. Soon, though, the old customs were back, and some new ones were added. Christmas once again became a big holiday, and that is what it still is in many lands. Because of the connections that Christmas has with false religion, however, those who want to please God do not celebrate it or any other holiday that has its roots in pagan worship.\n\nhttp://www.watchtower.org/library/w/2000/12/15/article_01.htm\n\n\n."

An of course the food is excellent!  I have been travelling though Indonesia for two months and I had a great time. I went to Java, where I visited Jakarta, a very busy city with a rich history. I also went to Bandung, where you can buy custom made jeans, really great! Yogjakarta is a beautiful town as well, with a lot of culture, really the cultural capital of Java! I also visited Bali. Bali is partly very touristic, for example the beach resorts Kuta, Sanur of Jimbaran. However, I loved the seafood in Jimbaran and had a great time in Kuta. I also enjoyed my time in Ubud, an artistic village in the middle of rice fields on Bali. Beautiful sights and I was fascinated by the Balinese culture and their religion, Hinduism. The Gili islands are great for diving and snorkeling. For peace and quiet, visit Gili Meno or Gili Air, if you want some more action, Gili Trawangan is maybe more for you. Anyway, all three islands look like real Bounty islands and you feel as if you are in the add...\nI would recommend everyone to visit Flores. What a beautiful island, with not that much tourism yet. People are very friendly, nature is breathtaking (for example watching the sunrise on the Kelimutu volcano, a great experience!) and the sights are so interesting.\nI really love Indonesia and find it a very diverse country. I was very sorry to hear about the earthquake and I really hope that Indonesia will have less problems with nature and disasters in the future, it definetly does not deserve it."

My second child was a year later, a boy who was 4 months premature, he managed to live for two days by being hooked up to machines. I watched them preform CPR on him several times from the moment he was born.On the 2nd day they informed us that it would be best for him to just unhook the machines and let him go.  I had to give them permission to unhook the machines & could do nothing but hold him as he he died in my arms. Even though they convinced me it was best for him, I cant get over the fact that I basically let him die. Every single day I relive both of these events but I have to  push my grief down,pretend to be happy - like neither happened. My husband & mother simply say to ""let it go"", ""get over it, they're gone""...!

"1","Why is it that...?","When I ask ""How would God feel about one person on His planet calling another person on His planet an 'illegal alien' ?"" ...I get a lot of answers that state: He would agree with that, because God wants us to follow to laws of the country...\n\nBut when it's about gay marriage, it's all of a sudden allowed to try to use God's Word to change the laws of the country.\n\nWhy that double standard?","you do understand that being against illegal immigration, and gay marriage is a consistant   stance.  Both are against the laws.  Many state constitutions make sodomy illegal.  This does not make some same sex relations outlawed  but when marriage laws were made it was for a hetero sexual relationship, and not consumated until they had sex.\n\nI disagree about God's position that a person would be somehow illegal.  While He gives us free will to govern and make our own decisions but that does not entail Him agreeing what we do is a good idea.  God did for some reason disperse us and have different languages given to us.  He never how ever made us draw lines in the sand and say this is mine stay out.  \n\nSomething you might find interesting is the study of linguistics.  They have found there are over 7 core languages which would not be true if man had developed along the lines proposed by evolutionary types of progress. It is evidence that either there were over 7 iniyial groups or there was some type of Tower of Babel type incident in our past.  Certainly there maybe explanations we have not yet thought of,  but it is another one of those discoverys which back the Biblical account,  though not proof.\n\nMany of God's rules had to do with stopping diseases from spreading.  Paul it is my opinion calls attention to the prostititis desease associated with anal sex.  There are others.  So far other than using Biblical guidance we have not found a way to stop STDS.\n\nI have no Biblical direction on Illegal immigration other than to call attention to the fact that If we just limited any persons income to say 1000 times the lowest income then borders would not be a problem for labor.  Jesus did point out it is wrong to accumulate as capitalists seem to think it is their God given right to do.\n\nNo way should any person be allowed to accumulate so much wealth that the only thing left for them to buy is power.   If this were the rule (limited income) then the whole immegration problem as well as many other problems would disappear.  Therefor God has expressed a directive (2 actually including no charging interest) which has to do with immigration and if it were not ignored we would not be having this problem\n\nso do what God says and decrease desease and increase fair distribution.\n\nHe just has this knack for bringing these things back to the basics.\nwhose picture is on this coin??\ntoo tired to be coherant\nyeah Dems. boo bush"

"2","How can gravity be explained in a simple nutshell?","I am pretty intelligent, but I have a hard time understanding how and why gravity exists.","As mentioned in other replies, physicists don't yet have all of the ""how"" questions answered. Einstein, in the General Theory of Relativity, pretty much nailed the underpinnings of the current theoretical understanding of gravity. Here is my attempt at the ""nutshell."" I'll start with an analogy. Let's say you are driving somewhere in the midwest or plains states--essentially flat ground, with a few rolling hills. Let's say you stop your car at the top of a slight rise. As you look around you, you see flat land in every direction. You're sitting on essentially a two-dimensional plane. Taking your foot off the brake, you notice the car starting to roll forward. Your initial observation about the 2-dimensional ""space"" you were sitting on isn't quite accurate. The 3rd dimension (altitude) has come into play, and gravity is pulling your car into the swale. What Einstein said (and how he came up with this back in the early 1900's is incredible) was that our THREE dimensions are really a slightly inaccurate description of the world (and universe) we inhabit. A fourth dimension, time, is part of the ""fabric"" of our surroundings. As in the case of that slight ""warp"" in the 2-dimensional farmland that led to a noticeable effect on your car, Einstein said that warps in the space-time continuum are experienced as gravity. As you know, Einstein was into the ""energy = mass"" thing big time, and you know that mass is tied up with gravity as well. If you want to get more cozy with these related concepts, I strongly recommend David Bodanis' book, ""E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation"" -- available as a ""BooksOnTape."" It's exciting, full of cool anecdotes about the heroes of 20th century physics, and... NO MATH, just concepts. Best of luck!"

"2","what is the molecular formula for ethanol?","","C2H5OH\n\nThe end (-anol) tells you it's an alcohol, which means it has an OH group somewhere.  The begining (eth-) is the prefix used in organic chemistry to mean two, which tells you there are two carbons.  The two carbons are bonded to each other (that's just how alcohols work, because of the electronegativities of the atoms), and each one can bond to three other things.  If it were an alkane (the simple ones that are just a carbon chain surrounded by the maximum possible hydrogen atoms), it would be two carbons with six hydrogens around it (which is called ethane), but since it's an alcohol, there has to be an OH group somewhere, which is added basically by sticking an oxygen between one of the carbon-hydrogen bonds in the alkane.  That leaves you with two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom, giving a molecular forumla of C2H6O.  But because the OH is basically one thing, it's generally written like that is a single atom, so the molecular forumla for ethanol is given as C2H5OH."

We simply expect to feel chilly, therefore we do.  It is really simple to just put on a sweater, wear a sweatshirt, even wear a jacket so we will not feel chilly.  Then when we ""warm up,"" take off whatever we had on.  The initial problem, though, is that when we take off the sweater, for example, we will feel chilled again after a short time UNLESS we are doing something physical.  Just sitting around gets to us and can make us feel chilly.\n\nThe best way to get over feeling chilly is to do something physical, walk around the house, go outside and walk around, take out the trash, do dishes, most anything.  Doing even the mildest physical activity will resolve any feeling of chills."

We have several more 'dwarf planets.'  \n\nThe difference is that, during planet formation, a planet's gravity will pull in all the material around it, leaving a planet surrounded \nby empty space.  This is referred to as 'clearing the neighborhood.'  A dwarf planet's gravity is not sufficient to pull in all the material around it, so it does not clear its neighborhood.  \n\nPluto is now a dwarf planet, along with several asteroids and other celestial bodies.  In fact, Pluto is a binary planet, because it and it's moon, Charon, orbit each other (the center of Charon's orbit is not a point inside of Pluto, but rather a point between the two bodies).  So Pluto probably won't even be considered a dwarf planet for long.\n\nThis Xena, as you call it, is twice the size of Pluto.  That's what reignited this whole controversy.  It's real name is 2003UB313.  Xena was only given to it as a temporary name."
"2","about HeilongJiang river?","","Heilongjiang River: Situated in the northernmost part of China, it has a drainage area of more than 1.62 million square km.\nNicknamed ""Mysterious Scenic Horizon"", the Heilongjiang is an international river, which meanders its way across Russia, Mongolia and China. The middle section of the 4,370-km-long river marks the boundary between China and Russia. Its water showing a darkish hue, the river looks like a swimming dragon as it flows through a picturesque landscape teeming with local folklore. Cruises on the river begin at Mohe in the north, and pass such places as Xilinji, Heihe, Xunke, and Zhanhe. Daredevils may also go rafting in the river. Mohe is China's northernmost town; also known as North Pole Village, it is where the aurora borealis can be observed during the summer solstice, which falls on June 21 or 22.\n\nAlso:\n\nThe Heilongjiang River, the Sino-Russian boundary river, runs across the northern part of north China. Its headstream includes the northern source and the southern source. The northern source Shilka River originates from the eastern foothills of the Mount Kent in the Outer Mongolia, and the southern source Argun River originates from the western slope of China's Great Hinggan Mountains. After the convergence of the southern source and the northern source at the Xiluoguhe Village, Mohe City, China, the river is called as the Heilongjiang River that runs eastwardly and finally empties into the Sea of Okhotsk. The Heilongjiang River flows across China, Russia and the Outer Mongolia. Its entire length is 4,370 kilometers, the 11th largest river in the world. Its drainage area is up to 1,843,000 square kilometers, ranking the 10th largest in the world. The drainage area within China accounts for 48% of the total drainage area.   \nThe Heilongjiang River was known as the Yushui, Wanshui and Heishui in ancient China. The forests are luxuriant and the aquatic grasses are verdant wherever the Heilongjiang River flows across. The rich black humus in the soil is carried into the river by the surface water and the river water therefore becomes livid. The Manchu people living in the Heilongjiang River Valley call the river Sahalianwula, the Sahalian means the black color, and the Wula means the river. The name of the Heilongjiang River (river in the shape of a black dragon) was thus formed. Therefore, it is lively and visual to name the slightly black river that looks like a black swimming dragon as the Heilongjiang River.\nThe Heilongjiang River has total 200 more tributaries in which the large ones include the Songari River, the Wusuli River, the Zeya River and the Bulieya River."

"2","Why does water have a current?","this is from my anatomy homework","Hmmm...\n\nIn order to clarify any possible ambiguities, I will attempt to answer this question from 2 very different perspectives.\n\nGiven this came from your anatomy homework:  Water carries a current because H2O readily dissociates into H+ and OH- ions.  The charged ions make water a good electron carrier, and therefore, a good conductor for current.\n\nIn case this came from another science class: Water carries a current because it is subject to physical forces such as atmospheric phenomenae, namely wind, the gravitic pull of the moon (the source of tides), the spinning of the earth, the creatures which inhabit it.... and basically anything which causes water to move.  All these forces sum up to give water the various currents we see in different parts of the world."

"3","can some one tell me about hyperthyroidism... i have just found i have it...can it make you cough alot at nigh","","What is hyperthyroidism? \n\nHyperthyroidism develops when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone controls your metabolism—how your body turns food into energy—and influences your heart rate, digestion, muscle and bone strength, and cholesterol levels. When you have too much thyroid hormone, all of your body's functions speed up. \n\nWhat causes hyperthyroidism? \n\nGraves' disease, also known in Europe as von Basedow's disease, is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Graves' disease, like many thyroid problems, often runs in families. \n\nHyperthyroidism can also be caused by thyroid nodules—growths in the thyroid gland—and by thyroiditis, which is inflammation of the thyroid gland. \n\nThis topic mostly focuses on hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease. However, many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are similar even when the causes are different.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism? \n\nYou may have hyperthyroidism if you:\n\nFeel nervous, moody, weak, or tired. \nHave hand tremors; have a fast or irregular heartbeat; or have trouble breathing, even when you are resting. \nAre sweating a lot, and have warm, red skin that may be itchy. \nHave frequent bowel movements. \nHave fine, soft hair that is falling out. \nLose weight even though you are eating normally or more than usual. \n\nHyperthyroidism symptoms are different depending on how old you are. For example, older adults may lose weight, not feel like eating, have an irregular heartbeat, or have chest pain. Symptoms can be easy to spot in some people and harder to notice in others.\n\nHow is hyperthyroidism diagnosed? \n\nDoctors diagnose hyperthyroidism by asking questions about your medical history, doing a physical exam, and ordering blood tests that tell how much thyroid hormone your body is making. \n\nHow is hyperthyroidism treated? \n\nThere are three treatments for hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid medication and radioactive iodine are the ones doctors use most often. Rarely, a person may have surgery. One or more of these treatments will lower your thyroid hormone levels and make you feel better. Once you have been treated for hyperthyroidism, you will need to have your thyroid hormone levels checked regularly, because there is always a chance that hyperthyroidism will come back. \n\nIf you do not get treatment, hyperthyroidism can lead to heart problems, bone problems, and thyroid storm, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the thyroid gland releases a large amount of thyroid hormone in a short period of time."

"3","Why do hair start to become white at a certain age?","","Hair turns gray as we age because the follicles at the base of the hair shaft cease to produce melanin. Each follicle contains a finite number of pigment cells. These pigment cells produce melanin, a chemical that gives the hair shaft (the visible strands) its color (black, brown, blonde, red, and all shades in between.) The darkness or lightness of your hair depends on how much melanin each strand contains. Melanin is the same pigment that makes skin tan upon exposure to the sun.\n\nWith age, the pigment cells in the follicle gradually die off. As they do so, that strand will no longer contain as much color and will show up as silver, gray, or white as it grows. Eventually, all the pigment cells will die and the hair becomes completely gray.\n\nThe age at which you go gray is determined by your genes."
"2","waterhammer in pipes?","(1)what is water hammer\n(2)where does it occur (10 points)\n(3)how do you neutralise it(10 points)","You have some very good answers here but I can add a little more.  Consider a pipe to be elastic (true!) but imagine that it is made of rubber.  Consider water to be nearly incompressible (a cubic inch of water at the bottom of the 7 mile deep Mariana trench still measures nearly a cubic inch).  Water can possess energy in two ways (neglecting heat); pressure energy or velocity energy and can easily convert back and forth.  When you extinguish velocity of a slug (or stream) of water you produce pressure and the pressure when relaxed can produce velocity.  This can go on and on until the energy is dissipated for example by friction.\n\nWhen a stream of water is flowing along an elastic pipe (think rubber) and you suddenly trip shut a guillotine valve (very fast acting) the velocity of the column of water is instantly extinguished and converted to pressure which starts as a shock wave stretching the rubber pipe toward the upstream end perhaps until it reaches the vessel supplying the water.  But the stream is then reversed as the rubber pipe relaxes squeezing out the water toward the vessel and continues until the rubber pipe is under a partial vacuum and shrinks.  In an ideal system (no friction), pressure waves would continue the travel back and forth along the pipe converting pressure to velocity and back to presure as the pipe expands and contracts under the changing pressure.  They call it water hammer because it actually can sound like someone hitting the pipe with a hammer.  Actually the pipe expands suddenly sending off a sound wave through the air.\n\nWater hammer can be avoided several ways.  For example if the pipe also contains air bubbles (accidently or on purpose) the bubbles will absorb any hydraulic shock wave preventing the elastic pipe from expanding and the bubbles re-expand slowly, slowing down the entire procedure.  The plumbing leading to many sinks in homes has a small ""empty"" vertical section near the sink to hold an air bubble which avoids a water hammer if the sink faucet is shut too fast.  It is sometimes necessary to drain the system with valves open to refill the air trap with air if it gets waterlogged.\n\nWater hammer can be avoided by shutting valves slowly rather than instantly.  Water hammer can occur in a pipe filled with steam because steam is easily compressed compared to an air bubble and a slug of water can be accelerated along a pipe by condensing steam until it ""strikes"" the end of the run and converts velocity to over-pressure.  I once got a frantic call at home (3 AM?) from a power plant under construction.  While testing a large pipe run for the first time under steam, the long say 12-inch pipe began to jump around threatening to break its pipe hangers and making a terrific racket.  Almost without waking up I told them to crack open any lowpoint valves or fittings to drain off all condensation and the pipe went back to sleep too.  In the finished plant there were automatic condensation drain valves to avoid water hammer which could damage the steam turbines too, etc."

The simple fact is that it is quite common in the Bible for human beings to be given names that have the purpose of declaring or reflecting a particular attribute of God, e.g., Eliab, Eliada, Elzaphan, Eliakim, Elisha, Eleazar, Tavel, Gedaliah.\n\nIn Isaiah 7:14 the Hebrew states ""hinei ha'almah harah veyoledet ben"" ""behold (hineih) the young woman (ha - the almah- young woman) is pregnant (harah) and shall give birth (ve-and yoledet-shall give birth) to a son (ben)"". The Christians translate this as ""behold a virgin shall give birth."" They have made two mistakes (probably deliberate) in the one verse. They mistranslate ""ha"" as ""a"" instead of ""the"". They mistranslate ""almah"" as ""virgin"", when in fact the Hebrew word for virgin is ""betulah"".

"3","Could dialysis be a treatment for people with Myasthenia Gravis?","Plasmapheri","Plasmapheresis and dialysis are two completely different things. Plasmapheresis is a procedure in which blood is separated into cells and plasma (liquid). The plasma is removed and replaced with fresh frozen plasma, a blood product called albumin and/or a plasma substitute. Dialysis is a therapy which eliminates the toxic wastes from the body when the kidney fails, and cannot do its job of eliminating these toxic wastes. The goal of these procedures are completely different.  In MG the immune system produces antibodies that become overactive and cause undesirable effects. These antibodies, called acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR), destroy or block certain receptor sites, resulting in muscle weakness. During plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange), these abnormal antibodies are removed from the bloodstream. Dialysis is a substitute for many of the normal duties of the kidneys, which are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood,  however, dialysis will not remove AChR and thus it will have no effect on MG."

"2","our epithelial tissue lacks blood supply and derives nutrition from the basement memrane.?","then why do we bleed when we prick our skin????","The skin is composed of two main layers: the outer epidermis and the inner dermis.The epidermis is epithelial tissue and is avascular, meaning that it does not have any blood vessels,therefore no blood supply. However, the dermis which is underneath the epidermis and part of the skin is vascular. It contains blood vessels, therefore blood supply. So, when the cut is superficial and goes only through the epidermis, thee is no bleeding. But if it is a deeper cut reaching the dermis, we will of course bleed because of the presence  of blood vessels in this region of the skin."

"1","Can the Trinity be rationally and logically explained ?","Some might say that explaining such things is beyond our knowledge ! and therefore we can't understand it ! They only say: We believe in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost !!! A And all 3=1= God.But I say that God has given me a tool- thinking - to ration and balance things logically. \n\nAnd rationally and logically 3 is not equal to 1, and that will lead me that christians worship 3 gods not one !! \n\nSomone said that we could explain this belief by giving the example of Water and its three states ( Ice, Liquid, Steam) that they are all water !! But this explaination is not valid ! Why ? \n\nBecause we are still left with three states not one, and when they are three with different characteristics, they are still not one !! \n\nI want a rational and logical proof that 3=1 !!!","By saying the trinity, you are saying,""There are 3 distinct persons united in one God."" They are not just names of the same God.They can co-exist at the same time and yet they are one. Taking this definition, It is actually not a mystery. The key to unsolving this mystery is understanding ""one"". The one is not the numerical number one. Below are the 2 definitions of one.\n\nA) Yachead – Absolute unity; the numerical number one\n– Abraham offered up his only (Yachead) son (Genesis 22:2,12)\n– They shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only (Yachead) son (Zechariah 12:10)\n\nB) Echad – A collective unity; more than one person, one crowd, one nation etc.\n–People gathered together as one (Echad) (Ezra 3:1)\n–The Lord or God is one (Echad) God (Deuteronomy 6:4)\n–In that day, there shall be one (Echad) Lord and His Name one (Echad) (Zechariah 14:9)\n\nFor example there is one nation, but in it there is many distinct different persons. So likewise God is one(echad) God.\n\nExample 2: There is one Sun to rule the earth,The sun manifests in threefold power,Light, fire and heat. They can co_exist at the same time. \n\nNow for the sake of study, Christians have seperated the father, the son and the holy spirit, to be able to learn about each individual in a more comprehensive manner.\n\nBut the truth is they are always together and they are inseperable.\n\nso all these to say that \na) God is one in operation but 3 in revelation\nb) The three are distinguishable but indivisible\n\nHope this helps"

"2","define  fraction crystallization?","chemistry","Fractional crystallization is occurs when a solid crystallizes from a liquid, and the solid has a different composition from the liquid.  Crystallization of single salt, such as sodium chloride (NaCl, or table salt) from an aqueous solution of NaCl is a trivial example of fractional crystallization.  More commonly the term refers to a situation in which more than one substance is dissolved in a solvent.  In this case, they will crystallize out of solution (precipitate) at different rates, and this provides a means of separating substances based on their different solubilities (e.g., in the trivial example of NaCl dissolved in water, one is, in fact, separating NaCl from H2O when the NaCl crystallizes).  Crystallization can be induced by changes in concentration, temperature, pressure, etc.\n\nI'm a geologist, and to geologists, fractional crystallization usually refers to crystallization crystallization and segregation of crystals from a magma (molten silicate rock) such that they do not remain in chemical ""communication"" with the remaing melt (i.e., they cannot remain in chemical equilibrium with the melt). This process is responsible for much of chemical variation seen in igneous rocks."

[Note, I shall be taking east and south as negative.]\n\ncos(AOB)= cos(-33)cos(40)cos(-12-56) + sin(-33)sin(40)\n        = cos(33)cos(40)cos(68) - sin(33)sin(40)\n        = -0.109417873\n\nSo AOB = 96.28175959 degrees\n       = 1.680433715 radians \n\nFinally to get the great circle distance between A and B we need the \nvalue of R, the radius of the earth. This is about 6371 km or 3959 \nmiles.\n\nIn miles the distance between A and B is 6652.84 miles."
"2","enzymatic structure?","what is it?","The function of all proteins is determined by its three-dimensional structure. This fact is never more critical than in the class of proteins called enzymes.\n\nEnzymes are little nano machines that have very specific jobs. These machines are only able to do their jobs on very specific molecules called substrates. The specificity of an enzyme to its substrate(s) is provided for by the fact that the substrate(s) fit into an area on the enzyme called the active site. The best analogy for picturing what an active site is like is the key and lock model. Think about all the different locks that accept keys in the world and how only specific keys work in individual locks. That's how enzymes and substrates are. There are a lot of enzymes in the world, just like there are a lot of keys in the world, but only specific keys will work in a specific lock, just like only spcific enzymes will work on a specific substrate(s). \n\nAny way, it's the shape of the acitve site that allows it to recognize and catalyze it's specific substrate into its eventual product -- that's the end result of the reaction the enzyme is helping along to completion. However, there are other important aspects to an enzyme's structure that also important. The active site is ucually arranged in such a way that two or three amino acids are positioned a three-dimensial configuration that will allow them to carry out the specific chemical reaction(s) that take place (I'm talking about either a substitution reaction, redox reaction, condensation reaction, etc.). These two or three amino acids are many times found in various positions along the sequence of the amino acid sequence. And the only way these active site amino acids are able to be placed in close proximity in the active site is by the secondary and tertiary structural configurations.\n\nSo, it's obvious, if you were to remove or replace any of the amino acids specific to the active site, you would in essence deactivate the enzyme. However, there are other ways of deactivating the enzyme. If you were to change/remove any other amino acid that was critical to the structural integrity of the whole protein, causing the protein to change its shape and thus shifting the location of the active site amino acide so that they couldn't complete their reactions, you have also effectively deactivated the protein.\n\nUsually the later change is easier to fix by some compensatory change that restores the activity of the enzyme than it is to restore activity of the former change."

"2","define function?","","In mathematics, a function relates each of its inputs to exactly one output. A standard notation for the output of the function f with the input x is f(x). The set of all inputs which a function accepts is called the domain of the function. The set of all outputs is called the range.\n\nFor example, the expression f(x) = x2 describes a function, f, that relates each input, x, with one output, x2. Thus, an input of 3 is related to an output of 9. Once a function, f, has been defined we can write, for example, f(4) = 16.\n\nIt is a usual practice in mathematics to introduce functions with temporary names like f; in the next paragraph we might define f(x) = 2x+1, and then f(4) = 9. When a name for the function is not needed, often the form y=x2 is used."

I know that there are men out there that would love this, but it is a growing trend and like men who want to let this go, there are also women too. But can society and men believe this is happening?","Definitely, but I'm sure it's not as common mainly because men and women have different biology.  I don't think being a particular sex prevents one from experiencing and feeling what the other sex can.  I don't know how society in general would feel about this because society does generalize and stereotype, but I'm certain a lot of men wouldn't think it was necessarily a bad thing......"

"2","Do you think that the world will eventually have hover cars and teleporters?","Will the world have hover cars and teleporters?","there already are hover cars (just not yet in production).\nas for teleportation, i suppose it is not yet possible. think about it, existence is like a 4 dimensional coordinate system where the 3 dimensions (x,y,z) are dependent on the 4th coordinate, which is time. Right now, if we follow this 4d coordinate system, the whole function of existence would be continuous. The introduction of teleportation in this scenarion would cause the function of existence to be discontinuous, which would be very hard to explain. Put simply, it is really hard to drastically change the (x,y,z) coordinates as the time it takes for the change approaches zero (teleportation)."

"2","Which is the most flexible joint in our body??","","The joint with the greatest degree of freedom in rotation and angles achievable would probably be the shoulder joint where the humerus connects to the scapula in the glenoid fossa.\n\nThe degree of motion in this joint is remarkable, and is probably a legacy of the brachiation ability of our ape forebears.\n\nThe flexibility of this joint also probably costs us too, as it is probably one of the most easily injured joints.  Dislocated shoulders and torn rotator cuffs are probably a result of this flexibility, as the joint is not well protected with connective tissue, large slabs of muscle or shelves of bone."

But after 2 weeks i still felt thesame tingly sensation he performed another test but this time E. coli  and staphylococcus showed up in the test results. Well he gave me some drugs but i  dont think they worked because i still feel this sensations. Those anyone outthere have a suggestion as to how to treat this","I agree with above.  There should be a sensitivity to  medications to bacteria that were present in your last sample...presumably your doctor has that information and selected the antibiotic accordingly.  If you continue to have symptoms then you should have a follow-up urinalysis to verify that you are free of an on-going infection.  If you are clear then there is an entity called ""interstitial cystitis""  Essentially an inflammatory process where the patient feels like there is an infection but none exists.  There are analgesics effective for the urethra...discuss it with your medical provider."

He had 3 DUI and went jail and still drinking like hell. He's just 25 and doesn't see what he's doing to himself?","You can't change him only yourself. He has to see the problem for himself or he will not be able to do the work to really quit, he will just become a good liar and hide it from you. Alcoholism is a disease. I am an alcoholic so I know. I just got two years sober through the fellowship of A.A. I know you care about him but the best thing you can do for him is to back off. Let him experience all the consequences of his drinking so that when he does quit he will never again think to himself ""oh, I wasn't that bad"" Make sure you are not enabling his behavior. Definitely don't try to control it or he will just resent you. If you really want to help him start by helping yourself. Find a local Alanon meeting and see what they have to say. It is filled with the family and friends of alcoholics and they know how to disengage with love. Good luck!"

Idolatry?","I think it doesn't really matter if the cross was in fact a cross, or if it was an execution stake. We know that both His hands and feet were nailed to it. In regard to this it would make sense that the actual execution stake had the shape of a cross.\nChristians have made the cross into something it was never meant to be. They have also abused it for centuries. It's not the cross as such, but rather what happened there that was meant to become symbolic.\nI do not believe that the cross is the sign of the antichrist even though, to many Jews it would certainly seem like it!"
"2","I have an Electronics PCB project and i have problem with the capacitors...?","I have some ceramic capacitors and some electrolytic capacitors. I want to ask whether i can use the electrolytics with the DC voltage. I will feed my circuit with 6, 12, -12v and I want to ask if the polarity of the electrolytics change, will the capacitors burn or go out? If you can help me, I will be very happy...\nThanks...","You cannot run polarized electrolytics backwards, without destroying them. You can find dozens of different non-polarized types on-line from parts distributors such as Mouser, Allied, and Digi-Key. But if you want to get around the problem, there's still another way; Place two standard polarized electrolytics in series, ""back-to-back"" so that their negative terminals are connected to each other. Then, place a rectifier diode, such as a 1N4002, in parallel with each capacitor, so that the cathodes are in contact with the positive capacitor terminals, and the anodes are in contact with the negative capacitor terminals.  What you will have now made is a ""bipolar"" or ""non-polarized"" capacitor that is roughly equivalent in value to one of the two original polarized capacitors!  If, for example, both of the electrolytics were rated at, say 2200 MFD @ 25 VDC, the new ""homebrew"" NP capacitor will function as a 2000 MFD, 25VAC capacitor!  Reversing polarity on this ""home brew"" capacitor will not cause any problems, whatsoever!"

The question reads ""Give the major product and justify which reaction mechanism is favored for each reaction."" I've pretty much gotten the answer (which is due to elimination because of the hindered nucleophile), but I'm still confused about the protic solvent. Does it affect whether the reaction is substitution or elimination? Thank you very much.","Protic solvent help stabilizes carbocation intermediate, hence promotes either SN1 or E1. It has nothing to do with preference in elimination or substitution.\nA protic solvent also help solvate anionic nucleophile, reducing its nucleophilicity. \nIn this case, it is true that your reaction will be an elimination, as t-Bu-O- (tertiary butoxide) always results in elimination, even with primary alkyl halides. Its nucleophilicity is lowered, but it is still a strong base. However, primary alkyl halides do not form carbocation. Instead of E1, they will undergo E2, in spite of the protic solvent. \nIndeed, E1 in alkyl halides usually lose in competition with SN1. E1 is important in alcohol reactions."

"1","What was the common unit of currency in the Old Testament?","","The Hebrews probably first used coins in the Persian period (500-350 B.C.). However, minting began around 700 B.C. in other nations. Prior to this precious metals were weighed, not counted as money.\n\nSome units appear as both measures of money and measures of weights. This comes from naming the coins after their weight. For example, the shekel was a weight long before it became a coin.\n\nIt is helpful to relate biblical monies to current values. But we cannot make exact equivalents. The fluctuating value of money's purchasing power is difficult to determine in our own day. It is even harder to evaluate currencies used two- to three thousand years ago.  Have a look at the chart on the website pasted below."

You have to take into account your bone structure and general health.\nA Orthopedic Surgeon (Bone Dr.) told me a simple test.  Wrap your hand around the opposite wrist.  If you can easily touch fingers, you have a small bone build. If your fingers barely touch, you have an average build.  And if they don't reach around, you have a big bone built.  This comes from our genes (family and culture).  Healthy weight should be determined by heart rate, blood pressure, blood chemistry, and others.  \nSee a doctor if your worried about being over weight.\nRelax if you think your a little underweight. \nGod (or nature if you prefer) made us to be a healthy size for our bone frame.

"3","What is zolair?","My doctor recommended some mew asthma medicine for me to use.. I would like to know more about it before I consider it.","The maker of the drug, Genentech, spells it Xolair, although some places, like CNN's website spell it Zolair.\n\nFor a pretty thorough description of the drug, here's a link to the page about it on Genentech's website: http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/immunological/xolair/index.jsp\n\nFor another perspective, here's an excerpt from a CNN interview:\n-----------------------------------------------\nEON HARRIS, CNN ANCHOR: The FDA advisory panel has approved a new medication to treat asthma brought on by allergies, and some are calling this a major advancement in the treatment of allergies.\nOur medical news correspondent Elizabeth Cohen checks in now with our ""Daily Dose"" of health news for us this morning.\n\nHow big is this news?\n\nELIZABETH COHEN, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: This would be big. If the FDA goes on to approve it, which it's expected that it would since it's gotten through this committee, it could be very big for people who suffer from allergic asthma, because it takes a whole different twist on how to treat it. Now 17 million Americans suffer from asthma. There are 5,000 deaths a year. Most of those who suffer have allergic asthma. In other words, it's caused by allergens that are in the air. This new drug is called Zolair (ph), and it acts on anti-IGE (ph) antibodies. So unlike some other treatments, it actually gets to the key underlying cause of allergic asthma.\n\nYou take a shot. You can see the shot here, every two to four weeks. It is not for children. I know many people when they hear asthma, they think of children. It is not for children. And in addition, it would be expensive. So you can bet that insurance companies are not going to let just anyone get it, because it's a very expensive drug.\n\nHARRIS: How expensive is very expensive?\n\nCOHEN: It could be as much as $10,000 a year.\n\nHARRIS: $10,000 a year? That's why it's not for children. What about side effects? Any side effects that we have to be worried about if this does actually hit market?\n\nCOHEN: Yes, there could be side effects, and actually, that's the reason why it's not for children, not because of the cost. We like to spend money on children. That's OK. But they didn't approve it for children, because there are concerns about safety. In the clinical trials that they did that they presented to the FDA, they found that patients were more likely to get cancer when they were on the drug, compared to patients who were given a placebo. If you take a look at the numbers, they are not huge -- .5 percent of the people who took the drug got cancer, compared to .2 percent of the people who were given a placebo.\n\nNow while this is not a huge difference, the company, Genentech, which is marketing this drug, says many patients may ultimately have adverse effects, because this was a study. So the numbers who got cancer were very, very small. When you give it to many, many people in the community, those numbers go up.\n\nHARRIS: Thanks, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Cohen. We'll learn some more about this new drug later on. \n---------------------------------------------------------"

"3","Where did aids/hiv originate?","","(m)\n\nThe origin of AIDS and HIV has puzzled scientists ever since the illness first came to light in the early 1980s. For over twenty years it has been the subject of fierce debate and the cause of countless arguments, with everything from a promiscuous flight attendant to a suspect vaccine programme being blamed. So what it the truth? Just where did AIDS come from?\n\nThe first recognised cases of AIDS occurred in the USA in the early 1980s (more about this period can be found on our history page). A number of gay men in New York and San Francisco suddenly began to develop rare opportunistic infections and cancers that seemed stubbornly resistant to any treatment. At this time, AIDS did not yet have a name, but it quickly became obvious that all the men were suffering from a common syndrome. The discovery of HIV, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus that causes AIDS was made soon after. While some were initially resistant to the connection (and indeed remain so today), there is now clear evidence to prove that HIV does cause AIDS. So, in order to find the source of AIDS, it is necessary to look for the origin of HIV, and find out How, When and Where HIV first began to cause disease in humans."

"2","how can I show this :T contains two numbers such that one divided the other?","Let T ⊂ {1,2,…,2n} where T has n +1 elements. Then T contains two numbers such that one divided the other. [any number could be written uniquely as an odd number times a power of 2, m = (2k – 1)2^j. Consider the function f: T -> {1,2,…n} defined by f(m) = k]","As the hint says, every number is some power of two multiplied by an odd number, or 2^j * s, where s is odd.\nNow, lets say you have written every number in the set T like that. What possible values for s have you come up with? They all have to be <= 2n-1, since the whole number is <= 2n. That means there are precisely n possibilities: 1, 3, .., 2n-1.\nHowever, you have chosen n+1 numbers. So two of those numbers must have the same 's' part.\nBut then if the numbers were 2^a * s and 2^b * s, one of those numbers is a multiple of the other - assuming a>b, (2^a * s)/(2^b * s) = 2^(a-b) (and similarly for a<=b)."

"2","does heat flow from hot to cold or from cold to hot?","","As my college chemistry professor said:\n\nOn a warm day, ther-mo-dy-nam-ics tells you that your cold beer is not going to get colder, it's going to get warmer so you better drink it sooner rather than later.\n\nThus, heat flows from hot to cold, not cold to hot.\n\nAnother way to look at it this.  Cold is not the presense of something, it is the absense of something.  It is the absense of thermal energy.  At absolute 0, there is now thermal energy in the system.  While placing something hot in the system will make the hot thing colder, it is because the thermal energy is migrating from the hot thing to warm up the cold surroundings."

"2","tell me about MSA?","","Well, since you asked this under medical, I will assume you mean MSA acrnym for:\n Multisystem atrophy (MSA) is a group of rare, multisystem degenerative diseases that have several clinical features of Parkinson�s and are sometimes referred to as the ""Parkinsonism-plus syndromes."" When MSA was first identified in 1960 it was named ""Shy-Drager Syndrome"" after the two physicians who first described its symptoms. Now, Shy-Drager Syndrome is recognized as only one of three manifestations of multisystem atrophy. The other two are Striatonigral Degeneration and Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy (OPCA). The three are lumped together as MSA because of their clinical overlap and neuroanatomical similiarities.\n\nMultisystem atrophy has three cardinal features:\n\n    * Parkinsonism (see Parkinson�s)\n    * Autonomic failure (including orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence or retention)\n    * Cerebellar ataxia (failure of muscular coordination) \n\nMy grandmother has Shy-Drager, is 85 years old.  Also has dementia, it may come with it, no one really knows for sue.  It also usually comes with depression, annoying behaviors, or is that just my grandma?\n\nI hope you don't have it.\n\nJust a note:  If a person has Shy Drager there are tricks with the dizziness problem.

There are pills for the blood pressure (to keep it up) but they have side effects."

"2","do batteries weigh less when they are exhausted than when they are fully charged?","","I think that the answer must be YES.\n\nLet's assume that  these are dry cell batteries (so they are not losing any matter by evaoporation or gaining any by using oxygen in the atmosphere.\n\nSo no particles get in or out of the battery.  However, the battery, once spent, has lost some energy (perhaps by powering a torch which then gives out light and heat energy).\n\nAccording to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2.  So this amount of energy must be equivalent to (an extremely small) quantity of matter and the mass of the battery must have reduced by this amount.  It will not be measurable in ordinary circumstances and I am sure that other factors (eg dust particles settling on it, etc) would FAR outweigh this mass of the released energy.  But theoretically, yes, it would weigh less.\n\nOne gets a similar kind of balance in radioactive decay; a uranium nucleus decays into some other bits and pieces but the mass of the other bits and pieces is slightly less than the mass of the original uranium nucleus in order to account for the energy that is released (in the form of EM radiation).\n\nHope this makes sense."

When it split up to drift into present locations it was probably pure coincidence why pointy parts of land masses pointed one way rather than another.  My pet theory is that luna tides (that affect the oceans and earth's crust) may have biased the direction of ""cracks"" in the land masses, but perhaps I'm just a luna-tick.  Incidentally the term lunatic originally applied to scientists who met once a month when they could travel at night with the aid of the light of a full moon."

So in this example, x = 17 from the first one, and x = -11 from the second one.\n\nBecause of the absolute value, expect to have double the usual amount of answers.  In other words, for a linear equation, normally you'd expect to have one answer.  If it's a linear absolute value, you'll have at most 2 (this doesn't mean you'll always have 2 - you might have 2 0's for an answer, as in |x/15| = 0).

This point moves considerably wandering in an eliptical path on a daily basis, and moves even more over a period of decades. On average it moves 10 km per year. Because of this all maps require a correction to be made for the reading of a compass in order to match the map. This is known as declination, also called magnetic declination. Declination also varies according to variations in the Earth's magnetic field in different geographic areas.  In order to use a magnetic compass to navigate with a map you must know your local declination value. \n\nTrue north is determined by the celestial North pole, which is the term used by navigators for the position of the star Polaris. This point will only be useful for about another thousand years because of the precession of the Earth during its orbit. Precession could be described as a wobble in the Earth's axis of rotation. \n\nCelestial north, or grid north is the point where the earth's spin axis hypothetically extends through the earth. Relative to our position on the planet this does not change because it is essentially an arbitrary point decided on by cartographers. However it is not consistent from one geographic coordinate system to another. This is because a globe is the only way to accurately represent all points on the earth and a map using any two dimensional coordinate system will have errors in some part of the map."
"3","how many times per day a normal person go to toilet for the heavy one?","","Once a day is normal, twice OK, more than 2 x's a day you should probably see a doctor or change your diet.(If this occurs on a daily basis)  It also depends on the amt and the consistency. Is it formed, loose and watery, or hard balls? formed is normal, loose and watery could mean too much fluid, a virus, or IBS(Irritable Bowel Syndrome), hard balls means you need to add more fiber and more fluid(especially water to your diet)"

Subtracting the earth radius from that gives\n\n1.8204521E7, or about 18 million km.\n\nIf you're considering a point that stays directly above the earth as it rotates, the nswer depends on the latitude and is the solution of a cubic equation.   I'm not going there for you!"
"3","can low sugar in a diabetic make them sleepy ?","","Absolutely. I am a Type 1 diabetic and when my blood sugar goes low enough, I get really tired and want to go to sleep. I have had it for almost 14 years. If this is happening to you, don't go to sleep! Drink some orange juice, grape juice, or have some candy, because you don't want to end up in a coma. It's really that serious. Not only can low blood sugar do this, high blood sugar can as well."
"2","Radiology Techs are making six figures?","My brother-in-law was complaining last month, it seems his practice out in CO lost their radiology tech to someone else, he was offered a crazy salary. I was told it was because he knew how to perform/read sonograms AND keep the equipment/software/hard drives maintained. I thought the money was only about 1/2 of what he was offered (mid six figs). I know the guy didn't have his MD...answers?","Actually, even though it sounds far fetched, it is possible. Radiology Tech is a fairly hot field. A few years ago, I was doing a rotation at UCSF. A friend I knew from before med school was working there as a Rad Tech. He was making approx. $35/hour, had his apartment paid for and took home close to $900/month food allowance. He also took extra shifts across the Bay in Oakland for $50/hour. He explained to me that ultrasound techs make much more. His probaly isn't the average situation for most Rad Techs, but an example of what is possible. One caveat, he was a ""traveler""--taking short term positions. If you are good, it can be a fairly nice lifestyle. As far as the 6 figures? Who knows? I'm sure this isn't what they make starting out or at public hospitals."

"1","Are we evolving passed the need for religion?","Religion has evolved throughout history...   It has become more complicated or un-complicated (depending on your view) as time has moved on.  Religion explains the unexplainable to us.  So, if we can understand things now that we couldn't understand before will we eventually not have a need for religion?  Is it possible that these belief systems are now failing?  If so, do you think we should replace it with another, or leave organization out of belief?","I'm not sure that you're correct that we actually understand more now than we did before.  It is still a common assumption that we only use 10% of our brains.  What would we know if we were able to use the other 90%?  We still have no idea what really exists outside of our immediate environment, however far that goes into space, we can only assume that we've only scratched the surface.  Despite all the things that we can create, we cannot get close to re-creating a telescopic lens as diverse as the human eye, nor can we create a shock absorbing device nearly as complex as the knee.  Yes, we are making incredible progress in certain areas, but we will never know everything.  Secondly, my relationship with Christ is not a result of me wanting to understand the world in which I live.  It is a result of a desire to be with the one who created me.  So, to answer your question, some religions may fail, they will be proven useless.  However, a relationship with Christ will never be unnecessary."
"2","what are glycerol used in the human body for?","","HELLO Amina,\nGlycerols are actually a sort of derived lipids obtained by hydrolysis of fats with water at high temperatures and pressures. it is in fact a trihydroxy alcohol, which is sweet and viscous. It forms esters like Triacyl glycerols(TGs) or Diacyl Glucerols or Monoacyl Glycerols  (or otherwise called Tri Glycerides) with fatty acids and phosphates. TGs are neutral fats, which, like cholesterol form the fat content of the body. These TGs get oxidized inside the mitochondria of cells  in the absence  (or scarcity) of glucose and act as a source of energy during starvation or dieting. Glycerol esters of higher fatty acids remain solid in room temperature and examples of such TGs include various vegetable oils. \nFatty acid esters with phosphate groups(PO4=) can form phosphoglycerides when they contain glycerol as the alcohol. Such compounds are important as protectors of the nervous tissue. Egs include phosphatidyl choline, and Lecithin. The last one is also present in Heart and liver..\nOoohhh that was a pretty long answer. \nHope I didn't get too technical and i suppose iwas clear on the topic,\nSo long then.."
"3","when you have pneumonia is it possible for food to go into your lungs?","","It is always possible to aspirate fluid or food into your lungs. If you have ever heard someone say that water went down the wrong tube that is what they are talking about. What prevents the food from entering the lungs is the epiglottis. Normally when you are at rest and breathing the epiglottis is open. When u initiate a swallowing activity the brain tells the muscles in your throat to close the epiglottis to protect the lungs from something that should not be there.\n\nPertaining to your question. If you have some sort of defect to the epiglottis. Either from stroke, head injury, or some other severe illness, you should be able to protect you lungs from foreign bodies. If the pneumonia is so bad that you need a breathing machine then this might effect swallowing. Also when the are putting the tube into the trachea there might be some aspiration. One person mentioned when u have a breathing tube u have a gastric tube which will help keep the stomach empty. \n\nSorry for the long winded answer. I hope this helps."
"2","Need help with chemistry homework....?","I'm done all my homework except the last question and the bonus which I do not know where to start....\n\nHow many moles of atoms are in 1 mole of Al(Ch3COO)3 \nIf you don't want to show all the steps to get the answer just explain how to do it if you're one of those people who believe i'm just trying to get other ppl to do my homework for me....","Al(CH3COOH)3 means that in each molecule of that salt, you have one aluminium and three acetate.  Each acetate contains two carbon, two oxygen and four hydrogen.  So in total, you have: 1 Al, 6 C, 12 H, 6 O.\n\nBecause you state that you have one mole of that aluminium acetate, this means that you have 1 mole of Al, 6 moles of C, 12 moles of H, 6 moles of O, so 25 moles of atoms total.\n\nIf you had more salt, lets say 4,8 moles of Al(CH3COOH)3, then you would have to multiply everything by 4,8."

"2","Is beauty a visual perception; a sense or a feeling ?","We have 5 senses but beauty is essentially a visual perception.... i mean say a person with his/her eyes closed smell a scent of rose from a Jar and open your eyes to find its coming from a cockcrach, smeared with rose scent paste..... disgusting or beauty?","I was going to say all 3, but since you put it that way it is a perception thing. But if you think about it. A blind person would not know about the cockaroach. Or if a person feel beautiful they are if to noone but them selves. and then there is always the old saying Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. so it is up to each individual."

"1","What is the legend of the dogwood tree?","","""What is the legend of the dogwood tree? Was the cross Jesus was crucified on made of dogwood?""\n\nThe Bible does not tell us what type of wood the cross Jesus was crucified on was made of. Roman history does not go into specifics as to how the crosses were made or what type of wood they were made of. As a result, we cannot know for sure what type of tree was used to make the cross. There is a legend that it was made of dogwood. This is unlikely considering the typical size of a dogwood tree. The legend of the dogwood tree, author unknown, is as follows:\n\nIn Jesus' time, the dogwood grew\nTo a stately size and a lovely hue.\n\n'Twas strong & firm it's branches interwoven\nFor the cross of Christ its timbers were chosen.\n\nSeeing the distress at this use of their wood\nChrist made a promise which still holds good:\n\n""Never again shall the dogwood grow\nLarge enough to be used so\n\nSlender & twisted, it shall be\nWith blossoms like the cross for all to see.\n\nAs blood stains the petals marked in brown\nThe blossom's center wears a thorny crown.\n\nAll who see it will remember me\nCrucified on a cross from the dogwood tree.\n\nCherished and protected this tree shall be\nA reminder to all of my agony.""\n\nAgain, this is just a ""legend."" It is a nice poem, but there is no Biblical basis to it. The legend of the dogwood tree is very likely not accurate.\n\nthank you,"

"2","How do sea clams reproduce?","","Agree with the above. Additional points - the fertilized egg, or zygote, begins to divide, just as in other animal species, still floating freely in the water.  It eventually develops into a ciliated, free-swimming larva called a veliger. The larva swims about in the water, many of them being eaten by small predators like copepods, and filter-feeding organisms. Eventually, those larvae which survive begin to develop the organs of a mature clam, including a mantle, the shell-producing organ.  The mantle then begins to extract minerals, especially calcium, from the ocean water and starts to form the shell.  The weight of the tiny shell carries the young clam to the bottom, where it continues to grow, if it lands on suitable substrate.  However, if the species is a rock-dweller, like marine mussels, and lands on a muddy or sandy bottom, it dies.  Likewise if the larva of a sand-dwelling clam lands on a hard rock bottom, it dies."

"2","Math Prob.?","Fifteen different farmers each had their own apple orchards. The first farmer had only one apple tree in his orchard, the second farmer had two trees in his orchard, and so on up to fifteen trees for the fifteenth farmer. \n\nAt harvest time, each farmer noticed something very peculiar: each tree in the same orchard produced the exact same number of apples. (Note that the number of apples per tree varied from orchard to orchard) And when all fifteen farmers got together to talk about it, they all realized that, if the farmer with eleven trees had given one apple to the farmer with seven trees, and the farmer with fourteen trees had given three apples each to the farmer with nine trees and the farmer with thirteen trees, they'd all end up with the exact same number of apples!\n\nHow many apples did the farmers produce in total?\n(Without Working)","The number of apples produced by each farmer MUST be a common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15. \n\n1=1\n2=2\n3=3\n4=2x2\n5=5\n8=2x2x2\n10=2x5\n12=2x2x3\n15=3x5\n\nLCM = 1x2x2x2x3x5\nLCM = 120\n\nThe smallest such multiple is 120. \n\nFor the other orchards (7, 9, 11, 13, 14) the various apple giveaways result in numbers that are evenly divisible.\n120 / 7 = 17 r. 1 (Needs one more)\n120 / 9 = 13 r. 3 (Needs three more)\n121 / 11 = 11 (Gives one away)\n120 / 13 = 9 r. 3 (Needs three more)\n126 / 14 = 9 (Gives six away)\n\nTherefore, each farmer produced an average of 120 apples. That means that, in total, all of the farmers produced 15 X 120 apples, or 1,800 apples.\n\nFor completeness:\nOrchard 1: 1 tree, 120 apples\nOrchard 2: 2 trees, 60 apples each (2 x 60 = 120)\nOrchard 3: 3 trees, 40 apples each (3 x 40 = 120)\nOrchard 4: 4 trees, 30 apples each (4 x 30 = 120)\nOrchard 5: 5 trees, 24 apples each (5 x 24 = 120)\nOrchard 6: 6 trees, 20 apples each (6 x 20 = 120)\nOrchard 7: 7 trees, 17 apples each (7 x 17 = 119) +1 (from 11)\nOrchard 8: 8 trees, 15 apples each (8 x 15 = 120)\nOrchard 9: 9 trees, 13 apples each (9 x 13 = 117) +3 (from 14)\nOrchard 10: 10 trees, 12 apples each (10 x 12 = 120)\nOrchard 11: 11 trees, 11 apples each (11 x 11 = 121) -1 (to 7)\nOrchard 12: 12 trees, 10 apples each (12 x 10 = 120)\nOrchard 13: 13 trees, 9 apples each (13 x 9 = 117) +3 (from 14)\nOrchard 14: 14 trees, 9 apples each (14 x 9 = 126) -6 (to 9 & 13)\nOrchard 15: 15 trees, 8 apples each (15 x 8 = 120) \n\nYou don't need to show all this work.  The basic idea is to find the LCM (120) of the orchards that had even batches.  The others will swap to also end up with 120 apples each.  15 x 120 = 1,800 apples."

"3","what are some natural ways to lower my cholesterol???","","Walking and taking an exercise regime is most important in lowering Cholestrol level. Anxiety/stress reduction is another aspect which should be looked to lower one's cholestrol level. The followings is recommendation on food items:\n\n\nCholesterol Lowering Foods \n \nCholesterol lowering foods - this may sound as an oxymoron! However, studies prove that some foods can assist in the reduction of cholesterol and could be incorporated into your new diet plan.\n\nCholesterol Lowering Margarine\n\nRecently, cholesterol lowering margarines have been introduced to the market. Benecol® is one of the products that has been confirmed to lower cholesterol on an average of 10% if used as recommended. In addition, this margarine does not affect your HDL, or ""good"" cholesterol. Other products include Take Control® margarine and salad dressings that are made from plant sterols, which are extracted from soybeans. These sterols trick your intestine into thinking they are cholesterol and when it tries to absorb them, it is not able to, therefore blocking cholesterol.\n\nSoy Protein\n\nCholesterol lowering quality of soy protein was evidenced when FDA approved (see FDA talk paper) the health claim for its effects on risk of heart disease. To achieve intended result, you have to consume at least four servings of 6.25 grams of soy protein totaling daily intake to 25 grams per day. Many food manufacturers have since introduced soy beverages and energy bars containing up to 10 to 20 grams of soy protein. People with high cholesterol - levels of 260-300, soy protein has shown to reduce cholesterol by 15-25%.\n\nNuts\n\nNuts such as almonds and walnuts that have high amount of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, also help lowering cholesterol. Researchers at the Loma Linda University found that a diet containing pecans (click here for Abstract) not only lowered total and LDL--or ""bad"" cholesterol significantly but also helped to maintain desirable levels of HDL--or ""good""--cholesterol. Another study conducted by the same University found that Mediterranean style diet that included walnuts (click here for Abstract) lowered cholesterol.\n\nOats and Barley\n\nIn lowering cholesterol, oats and barley have played a critical role. These foods have a soluble fiber known as Beta Glucan, which is the key, in how they lower the cholesterol. To gain the intended cholesterol lowering effect, you have to consume anywhere between two and four cups of dry oat or barley cereal each day.\n\nFruits and Vegetables\n\nFruits and vegetables such as apples, citrus fruit, berries, carrots, apricots, cabbage, sweet potatoes are high in soluble fiber and pectin both shown to be helpful in lowering cholesterol. At least five servings a day is recommended to benefit the full effect.\n\nFlaxseed\n\nFlaxseed provides alpha-linolenic acid a poly-unsaturated fat which has been shown to lower cholesterol while providing needed soluble fiber.\n\nOlive Oil\n\nOlive oil is one of the mono-saturated fats and studies have shown that it lowers blood cholesterol. Extra virgin olive oil is suggested to be better than other varieties.\n\nFish\n\nAccording to researchers, fish containing a omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids make the blood more slippery and less likely to clot in addition to lowering blood cholesterol.\n\nCautions:\n\nInstead of frying foods, bake, roast, or grill. Cut back on egg yolks and if you drink 2% milk change to 1% and if possible, skim milk."

"2","Why do bubbles form in a glass of tap water?","Why, when you leave a glass of water sitting around for a couple hours or so, do bubbles form it it (as if it were carbonated)?","For starters, these bubbles are not coming from the oxygen present in H2O, or any transition from gas to liquid state. The amount of activation energy it would take to break the H2O bond (plus the surrounding hydrogen bonds) to send liquid Oxygen to gas form is not going to come from room temperature. More likely, the gas bubbles you see are dissolved air. Your water has gone through many filtration stops and a multitude of meshes, all of which can dissolve small microscopic bubbles of air in the water. These either come out to the water-air interface or combine with neighboring bubbles (I would guess this reduces surface tension). You see the larger air bubbles."

"1","When did Amish religion originate? Where?","When and where did the Amish group originate? What are some disadvantages of being Amish?","Like the Mennonites, the Amish are descendants of the Swiss Anabaptists (1525). The Swiss Anabaptists, called the ""Swiss Brethren"", had their origins with Felix Manz and Conrad Grebel. The name ""Mennonite"" was applied later and came from Menno Simons (circa 1496–1561), who was an Anabaptist leader in the Rhein Lowlands. Simons was a Dutch Roman Catholic priest who converted to Anabaptism in 1536 and was baptized by Obbe Philips after renouncing his Catholic faith and office. He was a leader in the Lowland Anabaptist communities, but his influence reached gradually into Switzerland.\n\nThe Amish movement takes its name from that of Jacob Amman (c. 1656 – c. 1730), a Swiss Mennonite. Amman felt that the Mennonites were drifting from close adherence to the teachings of Simons and the 1632 Mennonite Dordrecht Confession of Faith. Much of the laxity was in the area of shunning excluded members, also called the ban (or Meidung in Pennsylvania German). However, the Swiss Mennonites never did practice strict shunning as the Lowland Anabaptists did. The ban meant that believers would terminate contact with a non-conforming member of the Mennonite society. Amman insisted upon this practice, even to the point of a spouse's refusing to sleep or eat with the banned member until he/she repented of his/her behavior.\n\nThis strict literalism brought about a division of the Swiss Mennonites, who, because of unwelcoming conditions in Switzerland, were scattered throughout Alsace to the Palatinate. This division occurred in 1693, and led to the establishment of the Amish. Because the Amish are the result of a division with the Mennonites, some consider the Amish a conservative Mennonite group—and, indeed, some Amish would not disagree with this title. Some Amish began to migrate to the United States in the 18th century. Many would eventually settle in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania; the first immigrants actually went to Berks County, but later moved, motivated partly by security issues, tied to the French and Indian War, and land issues. Other groups settled in or spread to Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Maryland, Tennesee, Wisconsin, Maine, and Canada."

"2","superconductivity?","What is it? any examples?","Certain materials allow electric currents to pass more freely than others.  We all know about copper, iron, silver and gold being conductors of this type.  However, even the best natural conductors offer some resistance to the passage of that current.  This resistance results in power loss due to heat.  It has been found that some materials, metals, metal alloys, and some ceramics, when cooled sufficiently, will pass those same currents without any loss due to heat.  This is very important for items like electromagnets which require huge amounts of current to create the kinds of magnetic fields that are useful, and still be efficient.  Since power is the square of the current (measured in amps) and resistance (measured in ohms), if the resistance is zero, no power is used to create the magnetic field."

"3","Does anyone have information about Tourettes Syndrom?","I am looking for any good websites that you may know of, any personal experiences, and if anyone out there suffers from Tourettes or knows somebody who does I'd love to hear your stories.","My 11 year old son has this disorder.  Tourettes is lifelong and there is not a cure.  It is not degenerative, and one can expect to have a normal lifespan.  The tics and vocal tremors are migratory, constantly changing.  One week he might be stuck on a word.  Not yelling.  Just repeating (""just Mom, can I just just just go outside and just just just play"")  Or it might be a head turn (or 10 head turns a minute).  It's different all the time.\n\nTourettes does not impede intelligence or ability to learn.  Learning may take longer because of the little distractions, though.  My son plays chess, is artistically gifted and has an IQ of 124.  I would not trade him for the world.  He has homework and chores just like everybody else.\n\nThe biggest (and most bothersome) misconception about this disorder is the coprolalia (shouting obscenities).  Fewer than 15% of people with TS ever display this symptom.  It is not a mandatory symptom for diagnosis.  Most people with TS never display this symptom.\n\nIt is not unusual to have Tourettes + (plus) other conditions.  My son has Tourettes, ADHD and OCD.  \n\nThanks for taking the time to find out about this and for asking.  Please feel free to contact me through this site for any questions."
"1","How do we know that Jesus was resurrected from the dead?","","There is, of course, no conclusive, CSI-type evidence that proves Christ's resurrection.  But consider the following:\n\nThose who felt threatened by Christ's resurrection (Jewish leadership, Roman authorities) were unable to produce a body to disprove the resurrection of Christ.\n\nThe fact that women are the first to find the empty tomb actually lends some credibility to the story.  A concocted story from first-century Judaea would not have placed women (who were not considererd reliable witnesses and who did not even have the right to testify in court) in such a prominent position in the story, because it would have made the story less believeable among contemporaries.\n\nMany people who knew Christ during his lifetime and who had witnessed his death sure didn't act like their rabbi was dead and gone.  On the contrary, Jesus's disciples behaved as though they KNEW that he was not dead - they risked their lives preaching the Good News.  Why would they all have done that if they knew it was a lie?  What's the point of dying for something you know to be untrue?\n\nDoes any of this prove that Jesus was resurrected?  No - and that proof will never be available.  The resurrection was, is, and always will be a matter of faith.  These are just a few thoughts to consider as you make your reasoned faith-judgment."
"2","[Optics] Is a convex lens always focusing? Is a concave lens always defocusing?","","The answer is: no.\n\nIt is not the shape of the lens that is important. It is the speed of the propagating wave in the medium in the lens relative to its speed in the medium outside the lens. \n\nConvex lenses made of glass in air focus rays of light. That is because light travels slower in glass than in air, so it is bent and becomes focussed. \n\nIf a convex lens was made of a material in which light travelled fast, and this was immersed in a medium in which light travelled slower, then it would not focus the light, but defocus the light. \n\nSuppose that one had a convex lens of rock, and the propagating wave was sound in air. Since sound travels through rock faster than air, the convex lens of rock would defocus the sound."

(Think of an ice cream cone with its point facing down.) The tank is externally braced to prevent its falling over. If the tank is full of a fluid which weighs 50 pounds per cubic foot, find the work done, in foot pounds, correct to the nearest hundred footpounds, in pumping all of the fluid out of the top of the tank.\n\nI know that the Volume of a cone= 1/3(pie)r^2h\nI tried working the problem in the same manner as the spherical cylinder in the book except I used 1/3(pie) as opposed to just pie.  I think the problem is my calculations of the radius being incorrect.  The definite integral I came up with was \n\n25                                                \nInt (1/3)(50)(pie)x(40-x)^2 \n0\nas my r^2 of the ith interval was (40ci -ci^2)\n\nAgain help is greatly appreciated.","First, you need the volume. The formula yields: V = pi rh/3 = 20000pi/3 cubic feet. Since it weighs 50 pounds per cubic foot, the ratio 50 lbs/ft.^3 = 1. So multiplying this to our volume equation, V = 20000pi/3 ft.^3 = 20000pi/3 ft.^3 * 50lbs/ft.^3 = 100000pi/3 lbs. The work function is (25-x)100000pi/3 = W(x). Integrate this result from x=0 to x=25, and you get the answer."

"2","Is a seasonal pond with creek a good location for a well to be installed?","The geology of the area around the house is such that water can only be found in fissures in the rocks, making water very difficult to find in the neighborhood. The house in question that I am interested has a seasonal pond and a well that gets 40 gpm. I don't know the level of the surface water in the well yet or it's exact location in relation to the seasonal pond and creek. There is a concrete canal nearby, but I am sure that does not allow much water to permeate into the ground.","If you have no other choice then go for it. Keep enough of a distance so the water will filter through the ground first. Also go as deep as you can and install a filter system to your water line. Good luck...if it ever goes dry call a water company to have it refilled."
"2","what causes granite to be transformed into gneiss?How is sandstone transformed into quartzite?","","Short, succinct and correct answer: \nHEAT and PRESSURE cause granite to become gneiss and change sandstone into quartzite.\n\nMore fleshed out, fuller (and still correct) answer:\nMetamorphic rocks form from heat and pressure which changes the original or parent rock into a completely new rock. The parent rock can be either sedimentary, igneous, or even another metamorphic rock. The word ""metamorphic"" comes from Greek and means ""To Change Form"".\n\nSolid rock can be changed into a new rock by stresses that cause an increase in heat and pressure. There are 3 main agents that cause metamorphism. Factors that cause an increase in Temperature, Pressure, and Chemical changes are the three agents that we are going to study. \n\nTemperature increases can be caused by layers of sediments being buried deeper and deeper under the surface of the Earth. As we descend into the earth the temperature increases about 25 degrees Celsius for every kilometer that we descend. The deeper the layers are buried the hotter the temperatures become. The great weight of these layers also causes an increase in pressure, which in turn, causes an increase in temperature. \n\nThe descending of rock layers at subduction zones causes metamorphism in two ways; the shearing effect of the plates sliding past each other causes the rocks coming in contact with the descending rocks to change. Some of the descending rock will melt because of this friction. When rock melts it is then considered igneous not metamorphic, but the rock next to the melted rock can be changed by the heat and become a metamorphic rock.\n\nMetamorphic rocks are almost always harder than sedimentary rocks. They are generally as hard and sometimes harder than igneous rocks. They form the roots of many mountain chains and are exposed to the surface after the softer outer layers of rocks are eroded away. Many metamorphic rocks are found in mountainous regions today and are a good indicator that ancient mountains were present in areas that are now low hill or even flat plains.\n\nGneiss is a high grade metamorphic rock. This means that gneiss has been subjected to more heat and pressure than many other metamorphic rocks. The minerals that compose gneiss are the same as granite. Feldspar is the most important mineral that makes up gneiss along with mica and quartz. Gneiss can be formed from a sedimentary rock such as sandstone or shale, or it can be formed from the metamorphism of the igneous rock granite. Gneiss can be used as paving and building stone.\n\nQuartzite is much harder than the parent rock sandstone. It forms from sandstone that has come into contact with deeply buried magmas. Quartzite looks very similar to its parent rock. The best way to tell quartzite from sandstone is to break the rocks. Sandstone will shatter into many individual grains of sand while quartzite will break across the grains."

"3","Does anyone know how to cure hay fever?","","The most appropriate medication depends on the type and severity of symptoms. Specific illnesses that are caused by allergies (such as asthma and eczema) may require other treatments.\n\nOptions include the following:\n\n1.  Short-acting antihistamines, which are generally over-the-counter (non-prescription), often relieve mild to moderate symptoms, but can cause drowsiness. A pediatrician should be consulted before using these medicines in children, as they may affect learning. One formerly prescription medication, loratadine (Claritin®), is now available over the counter in many countries. It does not tend to cause drowsiness or affect learning in children. Azelastin hydrocholoride (Astelin®) is the only anitihistamine available as a nasal spray. \n2.  Longer-acting antihistamines cause less drowsiness, can be equally effective, and usually do not interfere with learning. These medications include fexofenadine (Allegra), and cetirizine (Zyrtec). \n3.  Corticosteroid nasal sprays are effective and somewhat safe, and may be effective without oral antihistamines. These medications include fluticasone (Flonase/Flixonase), budesonide (Rhinocort), mometasone (Nasonex), triamcinolone (Nasacort) and beclomethasone (Beconase®). \n4.  Topical decongestants may also be helpful in reducing symptoms such as nasal congestion, but should not be used for long periods as stopping them after protracted use can lead to a rebound nasal congestion (Rhinitis medicamentosa). \n5.  Cromolyn sodium (or cromoglycate) is available as a nasal spray (Nasalcrom) for treating hay fever. Eye drop versions of cromolyn sodium are available for allergic conjunctivitis. \n6.  ""Allergy shots"" (Hyposensibilization, immunotherapy) are occasionally recommended if the allergen cannot be avoided and if symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular injections of the allergen, given in increasing doses (each dose is slightly larger than the previous dose) that may help the body adjust to the antigen."

Basically if you burn any organic material (eg natural gas, petroleum, coal or wood) without providing it with enough air it only half burns. The product of that half burning is carbon monoxide.\n\n>>>>and how do we get it?\n\nWe 'get' it mostly out of internal combustion engines, the manufacture of charcoal and the coking of coal. It can also be produced by voclanoes and various other chemical proceses.\n\nIt was once commonly piped into houses and streetlamps as 'town gas' or 'producer gas'. It burns quite well and in the days before electricity it was the main source of lighting in cities as well as fuel for ovens. It was still being used in some parts of the world up until the 1970s at least. It may still be used in some places.\n\n___________\n\nAddenda\n\nAlin said ""when you burn a piece of wood you get the smoke \n>>>>      wich is mostly CO2 (carbon dioxide) wich is not as \n>>>>      toxic and you can smell it. \n\nSmoke is not mostly carbon dioxide. Smoke is mostly particulate matter, water vapor, volatile organics and vapourised organic material.\n\nYou can not smell carbon dioxide. It is perfectly odourless, just like carbon monoxide. You can smell smoke because it coantins all those organics and partculates.\n\n\n\ngadha said "".Since all doors and windows are closed the\n>>>>>>>>>> child's breathing itself will produce enough CO\n>>>>>>>>>> to suffocate it .\n\nThis is nonsense.

Help!?","What is the healthiest diet, supplements, etc he can take, given the limitations to his diet.","Try seitan, you can get it chicken or beef style at a good health food store. It is made from Wheat Gluten and is a good source of protein. Nearly every kid likes Peanut or Almond butter, you can use that on fruits and veggies or in smoothies. (Get the sugar free, organic kind if you can.) Silken Tofu (available at any grocery store) adds a creamy texture to fruit smoothies and is an excellent protein boost. There are also dozens of meatless meat substitutes in your grocer's freezer that taste great and provide protein. Lastly, keep in mind that most people think humans need a lot more protein to be healthy than they actually do.

"2","who discovered the cure for a smallpox??","","it was edward jenner. but will u be satisfied with tht? i think i can tell u more...\n\nSmallpox is a viral disease characterized by a skin rash and a high death rate.\nOverview, Causes, & Risk Factors\n\nSmallpox was once found throughout the world, causing illness and death wherever it occurred. Smallpox was primarily a disease of children and young adults, with family members often infecting each other.\n\nA massive program by the World Health Organization (WHO) eradicated all known smallpox viruses from the world in 1977, except for samples that were saved by various governments for research purposes. The vaccine was discontinued in the United States in 1972. In 1980, WHO recommended that all countries stop vaccinating for smallpox.\n\nIn 1980, WHO also recommended that the remaining virus samples be transferred to two WHO laboratories for storage. Those laboratories were the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, and a laboratory in Russia. Russia, however, started a program to produce the smallpox virus in mass quantities, specifically for bombs and other weaponry.\n\nSome believe that other countries such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea may also hold some stores of the smallpox virus. Researchers continue to debate whether or not to kill the last remaining samples of the virus, or to preserve it in case there may be some future reason to study it.\n\nAccording to the CDC, since the vaccine has not been administered in the U.S. since 1972, those persons who had received the vaccine in the past are likely susceptible now (as are those who have never been vaccinated). It is not known how long previous vaccinations would remain effective, but it is unlikely that people would still have a high enough level of immunity to protect against the virus.\n\nRisk factors for smallpox include being a laboratory worker who handles the virus (rare), or being in the environment where the virus was released as a biological weapon.\n\nTHE RISK OF TERRORISM\n\nIt is conceivable that smallpox could be deliberately reintroduced into the population. Smallpox could be released by aerosol, and it would spread easily because the virus remains very stable in aerosol form.\n\nIt would take no more than 50-100 cases to cause legitimate concern on an international level. Emergency measures would need to be taken immediately.\n\nSmallpox is highly contagious from one person to another. It is most contagious during the first week, and is spread from saliva droplets. It may continue to be contagious until the scabs from the rash fall off. It may also be spread from bed sheets and clothing.\n\nResearchers believe that the smallpox infection (if released in aerosol form, under favorable conditions, without sunlight) could remain viable for as long as 24 hours. In unfavorable conditions, the virus may only remain viable for 6 hours. There is clear evidence that shows that the virus can remain viable on bed linens and clothes for significant periods of time.\nSmallpox Symptoms & Signs\n\nSmallpox has two forms: 1) Variola major -- which is a serious illness with a mortality rate according to the CDC of 30% or more, in unvaccinated people, and 2) Variola minor -- a milder infection with a mortality rate of less than 1%. The incubation period for smallpox is approximately 12-14 days. The symptoms are:\n\nHigh fever \nFatigue \nSevere headache \nBackache \nMalaise \nRash, raised and pink on the skin, starting centrally and spreading outwards. (First the mucosa of the mouth and throat, then face, forearms, trunk, and legs. Rash turns to pus-filled lesions that become crusty on the eighth or ninth day.) \nDelirium \nVomiting and diarrhea \nExcessive bleeding \n\nSmallpox Prevention\n\nMany people were vaccinated for smallpox in the past -- but the vaccination is no longer given because the virus has been eradicated. According to the CDC, the United States has supply of the smallpox vaccine sufficient for the entire population at this time.\n\nThe"

Carbon is the central atom, with 4 electrons.  It shares one elctron with each of the 4 other elements.  Hydrogen has 1 electron, and needs just one more to complete its shell (it is unique in this way; most need 8, but hydrogen just needs 2).  Chlorine has 7 electrons in its outer shell and needs just one more to complete its outer shell.\n\nSo, the lewis structure is drawn in a cross fashion.  \n\nHorizontally...   H:C:Cl:::\n\nVertically...   H:C:Cl:::   (where they cross at the C)\n\nSo, C has a pair of electrons on each side, and each Cl has a pair of electrons on each side (not 3 pairs on one side as I have drawn)\n\nCheck out the attached link for more help"

"2","Describe the processes that cause these chemical substances to move into and out of cells.?","","It would depend on several factors. Small, uncharged molecules can pass through the cell membrane through diffusion. When it is water, it is called osmosis. Diffusion can only occur into the cell when the concentration of the substance is greater outside the cell than within it, and likewise only out of the cell when the concetration is greater inside the cell than outside. This is called the concentration gradient.\n\nWhen the molecule is charged or is large (such as a chlorine ion or a lactose molecule), it requires active transport by carrier proteins. There are also carrier proteins that help to transport against the concentration gradient.\n\n[Edit] \nAfter thinking for a bit, I believe it would be pertinent to include something about the more complex methods of active transport.\n\nThere are two ""directions"" of the complex forms of active transport: in (endocytosis) and out (exocytosis).\n\nExocytosis is when a vesicle, after being released from the Golgi complex, fuses to the cell membrane, releasing the contents.\n\nEndocytosis is done by three main means: Phagocytosis, Pinocytosis, and Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis.\n\nPhagocytosis is the process of enveloping a large particle, such as how many unicellular organisms ""eat"" other organisms. The large particle comes in contact with the cell membrane, stimulating the formation of a vesicle. This vesicle then enters the cell and depending on the contents may fuse with a lysosome to help to digest it.\n\nPinocytosis also forms a vesicle, but differs from phagocytosis because it forms a much smaller vesicle.\n\nReceptor-mediated endocytosis is when particles that cannot normally enter the cell bond to receptor proteins embedded in the cell membrane. These proteins then congregate and form a vesicle. \n\nIn all forms of endocytosis and exocytosis, ATP is required for energy."

Abdul Kalam, is the current President of India. He is also a notable scientist and an engineer. He is often referred to as the Missile Man of India.\n\nhim in the past. His book ""India 2020"" strongly advocates an action plan to develop India into a knowledge superpower and into a developed nation by the year 2020. Kalam is credited with the view that India ought to take a more assertive stance in international relations; he apparently regards his work on India's nuclear weapons program as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.\n\n \nDorrit Moussaieff with Indian president Abdul Kalam in the National Gallery of IcelandKalam continues to take an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology as well. He has proposed a research programme to increase intelligence using bio-implants. He is a supporter of Open source software over proprietary solutions and believes that the use of open source software on a large scale will bring more people the benefits of information technology.\n\n[edit]\nPersonal life\nKalam observes strict personal discipline, practicing vegetarianism, teetotalism and celibacy. Kalam is a scholar of Tirukkural; in most of his speeches, he quotes at least one kural. It is believed that he reads the Qur'an (the main holy text of his family's faith, Islam) regularly and also the Bhagavad Gita at times. Kalam has written several inspirational books, most notably his autobiography Wings of Fire, aimed at motivating Indian youth. Another of his books, Guiding Souls: Dialogues on the Purpose of Life reveals his spiritual side. It has been reported that there is considerable demand in South Korea for translated versions of books authored by him.\n\n[edit]\nTrivia\nHe is a vegetarian. \nHe loves children, and encourages their audiences with him. [citation needed] \nOn Tuesday, 14 February, 2006, he created history by becoming the country's first President to undertake an undersea journey. Abdul Kalam boarded the INS Sindhurakshak, a Russian-origin kilo class submarine, from the Vishakapattanam Naval dockyard. The duration of the journey was around three-and-half hours during which Kalam had lunch with the crewmembers. \n[edit]\nBooks\nIndia 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Y.S.

There has been no eruption since then. The eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterised by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed Plinian after the Roman writer who observed the AD 79 eruption. On occasion, the eruptions have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ashes; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ashes fell on Constantinople (now known as Istanbul), over 1,000 miles away.

What they reported as a circular feature later turned out to be a crater estimated to be 180 kilometers in diameter. Other researchers would later find that the end-Cretaceous extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs had lasted for thousands of years instead of millions of years as had previously been thought. This would be the final piece of evidence that convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extra-terrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change (which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period).""\n\nIt seems to be a bit more than a layer of clay in the ground.\n\nwhether this is worthy enough for biblical mention is debatable, but it seems that such a large impact would have had tremendous effects on any living species at the time, including (as creationists claim) humans.  why is there no mention of it either in the bible or other human cultures?  probably because it happened long before any humans were around.  it would have been a very important event, more important than a lot of the mentioned events in the bible.\n\nand if it is mentioned in the bible, please provide a passage."

"1","If you speak more than a Language, what controls whom to speak to in a specific language?","most of us speaks more than a language. So what part of the brain decides the language to be spoken with with certin people?","Languages are learnt by absorbing it's dialects by the subconcious mind. When you learn a language when you are grown up it is harder to learn it. The same language would have been learnt easily had it been learnt in childhood. For example , if you begin to learn chinese it is extremely difficult when you are grown up as your concious mind interferes with the learning process but have you noticed that the chinese children have mastered it since their early years? The same Logic holds true for all languages.\n\nNow coming to the central point of using a language. This is governed by your mood & your requirement of Communicating. The best of the best speakers communicating in many languages  ALWAYS curse , use unusable words in THEIR MOTHER TONGUE. But when it comes to meeting their needs they revert to what will benefit them the most. For example ,according to your moods, governed by the subconcious partly residing in the Right brain you will pass comments on a woman/man you have a crush on, in a language she/he won't understand in a Public place. So you can see that the usage of language is governed by your mind especially the subconcious."

"2","a gamma ray has an equation of y = A sin Bt. What is B if the wavelength is 3 x 10^ -10 cm and c = 3 x 10^10?","","In y = A sin Bt, B is the frequency in radians/second, or B = 2pi*f, where f is the frequency in cycles/second, or Hertz.\n\nI assume by ""c= 3 x 10^10"", you're referring to the speed of light, which is 3*10^10 cm/sec.\n\nf = c / wavelength, so f = 3*10^10 cm/sec / (3*10^-10cm) = 3*10^20 cycles/sec or 3*10^20Hz.\n\nSo B = 2*pi*f = 2*pi*3*10^20 = 6*pi*10^20 radians/sec.

There isn't going to being any fireworks but a spirtual sense of connection.

Thanks!!","I have no idea about the second part of your question, and I'm not entirely sure if it's true, but I'll tell you what RNA is.\n\nRNA is essentially a copy of DNA that can travel out of the nucleus and to other parts of the cell. RNA is used as instructions. DNA can't leave the cell or it'll be destroyed by enzymes looking for viruses.\n\nMessenger RNA (or mRNA) is the one that goes from the nucleus to the ribosomes (where proteins are made) with instructions for which specific protein is to be made. Transfer RNA (tRNA) brings the appropriate amino acids (pieces of protein) to the Ribosomes so that the desired proteins can be made.\n\nthere are many other types of RNA, such as ribosomal RNA, but I know much less about those.\nhope this helps!"

"2","Are all the controll rods pulled when the nuclear power plant run at maximum?","","I am assuming you are asking if all rods are fully withdrawn - the answer is no.  Since the fuel (e.g., uranium) is gradually spent when it undergoes fission, you have to put more uranium than you initially need into the reactor core.  Otherwise, you would have to keep adding fuel (this would be expensive) in order to keep operating at the ""max"" power.  Since it is slow and painful to change out the fuel, the fuel cells contain more fuel than they need, and so the plant operates with the control rods only partially withdrawn.  As the plant ages and the fuel is being used up, the height at which the rods are maintained increases, until the end of the reactor core life, when the rods being fully withdrawn will not supply enough power.  This is simplified explanation; there are a lot of other factors which affect rod height also (temperature, recent power history, etc.).  I have ignored those for simplicity - it is still an accurate explanation.\n\nIf you are asking if some control rods remain at the bottom of the core when operating, I've never seen this.  I have, however, seen reactors where SOME rods are fully withdrawn, while the remaining ones are only partially withdrawn."

"2","What is the difference between ketoconazole & fluconazole?","HI\niam a pharmacist and i have assignment in medicinal chemistry in the differences between ketoconazole and fluconazole in SAR(structure activity relation ship)\nthnxx","Ketoconazole is a synthetic antifungal drug used to prevent and treat skin and fungal infections, especially in immunocompromised patients such as those with AIDS. Due to its side-effect profile, it has been superseded by newer antifungals, such as fluconazole and itraconazole. Ketoconazole is sold commercially as an anti-dandruff shampoo, branded Nizoral®, by Janssen Pharmaceutica.\n\nKetoconazole is very lipophilic, which leads to accumulation in fatty tissues. The less toxic and more effective triazole compounds fluconazole and itraconazole have largely replaced ketoconazole for internal use. Ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids or other causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug's efficacy when taken orally.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoconazole\n\n\nFluconazole (INN) (IPA: [fluˈkɒnəzoʊl]) is a triazole antifungal drug used in the treatment and prevention of superficial and systemic fungal infections. It is commonly marketed under the trade name Diflucan (Pfizer).\n\nMode of action\nLike other imidazole- and triazole-class antifungals, fluconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14α-demethylase. Mammalian demethylase activity is much less sensitive to fluconazole than fungal demethylase. This inhibition prevents the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell wall, and subsequent accumulation of 14α-methyl sterols. Fluconazole is primarily fungistatic, however may be fungicidal against certain organisms in a dose-dependent manner.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"
"2","What is the structure of chlorophyll?What is the energy transfer mechanism?","Alternatively where can I find more info on this topic?","Chlorophyll is a green photosynthetic pigment found in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Its name is derived from ancient Greek: chloros = green and phyllon = leaf. Chlorophyll absorbs most strongly in the blue and red but poorly in the green portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues like plant leaves.\n\nBesides chlorophyll a, there are other pigments, called accessory pigments, which occur in these pigment-protein antenna complexes. They include other forms of chlorohphyll, such as chlorophyll b in green algal and higher plant antennae, while other algae may contain chlorophyll c or d. In addition, there are many non-chlorophyll accessory pigments, such as carotenoids or phycobilins which also absorb light and transfer that light energy to the photosystem chlorophylls. Some of these accessory pigments, particularly the carotenoids, also serve to absorb and dissipate excess light energy, or work as antioxidants. The large, physically associated group of chlorophylls and other accesory pigments is sometimes referred to as a pigment bed, though this term is losing prominence with the advent of detailed knowledge of the structural organization of the photosystem and antenna complexes.\n\nThe function of the reaction center chlorophyll is to use the light energy absorbed by and transferred to it from the other chlorophylls in the photosystems to undergo a charge separation, a specific redox reaction in which the chlorophyll donates an electron into a series of molecular intermediates called an electron transport chain. The charged reaction center chlorophyll (P680+) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron. In Photosystem II, the electron which reduces P680+ ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into O2 and H+ through several intermediates. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms like plants produce O2 gas, and is the source for practically all the O2 in Earth's atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II, thus the P700+ of Photosystem I is usually reduced, via many intermediates in the thylacoid membrane, by electrons ultimately from Photosystem II. Electron transfer reactions in the thylacoid membranes are complex, however, and the source of electrons used to reduce P700+ can vary. The electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorohpylls is used to shuttle H+ ions across the thylacoid membrane, setting up a chemiosmotic potential mainly used to produce ATP chemical energy, and those electrons ultimately reduce NAD+ to NADPH a universal reductant used to reduce CO2 into sugars as well as for other biosynthetic reductions."

I researched this and discovered that I probably had plantar fasciitis. It has come and gone since and now seems to be going away. I wonder how others have dealt with it and how they got past it.","I have it too and like the others here, mine seems to come and go. I know how painful it can be, but I just tend to ""work through it"". I'm on my feet all day. Losing weight can be of help if you are overweight. Also try wearing shoes with good support. You might also try insoles or prescription orthotics. There are also stretching exercises you can do as well as wearing a special boot at night that helps to stretch those ligaments. Another alternative is perhaps seeing a clinical massage therapist. Best wishes and happy feet!"
"2","if a motorcycle travels 40 miles at x miles per hour and 50 miles at x+10 mph what's the average speed?","","Every answer I've seen to this question so far has been dead wrong (or at least mostly wrong).\n\nTo compute average speed in any word problem, figure out the total distance traveled, total time traveled, and then divide. average speed = (total distance)/(total time)\n\nTotal distance traveled here is clearly 40+50 = 90 miles.\n\nTotal time traveled is a bit trickier, so we'll look at this one leg at a time. For the first leg of the journey, we went 40 miles at x mph. Time elapsed is the distance traveled divided by the rate of speed, or 40/x. Does this check out? Let x be a nice easy number like 20 mph and check it for yourself.\n\nThen the time for the second leg will be 50/(x+10), and total time is 40/x + 50/(x+10).\n\nNow we've got total distance and total time, so we just divide to get the final answer:\naverage speed = 90/(40/x + 50/(x+10))\n\nWe can pick a value for x to see if this makes sense. Let x = 40. Then on the first leg we traveled 40 miles at 40 miles an hour (so clearly 1 hour) and on the second leg we traveled 50 miles at 40+10= 50 miles per hour (so another hour). Total time is therefore 2 hours for this case, and average speed is 45 miles per hour. We get the same answer by plugging x = 40 into the final answer, so it checks out at least for this case.\n\nNote that the correct answer will only be 45 mph if x = 40. Any other value of x will produce a different result, and we don't have any information given to us that will give us x, so the best we can do is test different values of x just to make sure our answers make some sort of sense.\n\nAlso note that the obvious answer that you get by averaging x and x + 10 to give you x + 5 is wrong in general (it turns out to be correct if x = 40, but we don't really know if this is the case). We can't just average speeds together unless we know that an equal amout of time was spent traveling at each of these speeds, and we don't. This is a very popular standardized test trap that most people will fall for."

"2","why the peole sleep after work whole day/night ( not wanting)?","","Sleep is the regular state of natural rest observed in all mammals, birds and fish. Sleep is not actually ""unconsciousness,"" but rather, it is a natural state of rest characterized by a reduction in voluntary body movement, decreased awareness of the surroundings, an increased rate of anabolism (the synthesis of cell structures) and a decreased rate of catabolism (the breakdown of cell structures). Therefore, since consciousness is literally the awareness of the surroundings, being asleep is just an altered state of consciousness, as opposed to being unconscious. It is heavily influenced by circadian rhythms and by hormonal and environmental factors. Sleep performs a restorative function for the brain and body as evidenced by the myriad symptoms of metabolic dysfunction that result when animals are deprived of sleep.\nThe function of sleep in health and in disease is being increasingly studied in specialized sleep laboratories throughout the world. Not only insomnia, but more recently elucidated sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy are evaluated in such facilities. The increasing prevalence of sleep disorders is likely to be a function both of more sophisticated diagnostic tests and the disruption of the normal day-night cycle in modern societies."

"1","If there were no Hell, and no punishment for not belieivng/ loving God...?","Would you still love God?  Would this make you love God more or less?  \n\nPlease justify your answer.","Yes, I would still love God. I like him, and I like spending time with him just learning and growing. I love him because I want to, not because I'm afraid of hell.\n\nI think that your question goes a little deeper than just that though. Something to think about: if I do something wrong, like steal, I have to be punished, maybe even sent to prison. If I wasn't, then justice would not be served and I would get away with it. Now I'm just one person. What if we let the whole world get away with stealing? We would have total chaos. We punish our criminals because we believe in justice. \n\nGod can't let us get away with out sin either. If he did, the world would be totally chaotic. If he didn't punish us for the things that we did wrong, then he would no longer be just. \n\nSo if God is just, then how is it possible that we can go to heaven? Jesus (God's Son), lived on the earth and never sinned. He died on the cross to take our place and received the punishment that we deserve. And since he conquered sin (he never sinned), he rose from the dead on the third day, conquering death as well. SO, if we as individuals accept Jesus, allowing him to take the punishment instead of us, then we get to have a relationship with God, and spend eternity praising him and enjoying him forever.  \n\nIf we weren't punished for our sins, then God would not be just. Being just is an important part of who he is. In fact, if he were not just, he would be completely different, and so would our world. (Just picture living in a world with no punishment for crimes)."

If any one of those is out of whack you won't experience the best possible gains. In some cases you won't see any.\n\nMy advice would be:\n\n1. Cut you workouts down to three full body workouts a week. Either Mon,Wed,Fri or Tues,Thurs,Sat. This schedule will allow your muscles to recover and grow. Remember to increase the weight on all your lifts by 10% every two weeks. Try this for about six months. \n\n2. Get a gram of protein for every pound of bodyweight or your lean body mass. Try to get it from lean sources. Eat about six small meals per day.\n\n3. Try creatine and HMB.\n\n4. Drink plenty of water. If you divide your bodyweight in pounds by two that is the number of ounces of water you need to drink in a day.\n\n5. Remember to stretch.\n\n6. Do at least a half hour of cardio three times a week. For some fun cardio take up a martial art like Karate or Tae Kwon Do.\n\n7. Take a good multivitamin.\n\n8. Find out what your body type is. Are you a mesomorph, endomorph, or ectomorph? Are you a combination of any of these. These bodytypes determine how you should workout. Look them up on www.bodybuilding.com for a full explanation.\n\n9. Get as much quality sleep as you can. Eight hours a night is good. You grow while you are sleeping.\n\nHere's a sample three day workout:\n\nWORK OUT PROGRAM \n3 X WEEK\n\n\nLEGS\nSquat 3x8\nStraight Leg Deadlift 3x10\nStanding Calf Raise 3x10-15\n\nCHEST\nBench Press 3x8-10\nFlyes 3x8-10\n\nBACK\nPulldown 3x10-15\nBent Over Rows 3x6-10\nDeadlifts 3x10-12\n\nSHOULDERS\n\nMilitary Press 3x8-10\nUpright Rows 3x10-15\n\nBICEPS\n\nStanding Barbell Curls 3x10-12\n\nTRICEPS \nLying Tricep Extensions 3x10-15\n\nSTOMACH\n\nCrunches 3x50\n\n\nMon., Wed., Fri. or Tues., Thurs., Sat.\n\nEvery two weeks increase the weight on each exercise by 10%. If you can’t don’t worry about it. Keep trying until you can.\n\nBe consistant with this kind of routine for about 1-2 years straight before you move into heavier stuff. Trust me....this is more than enough for your age.  A while you can move up into heavier workouts. Hope this helps!\n\nIf heavy weights bother you or  you are worried about stunting your growth here is another routine you can do:\n\nUse some 10lbs dumbbells to work your biceps. Do like 3 sets of 25-50reps Mon, Wed, Fri or Tues, Thurs, Sat. Get yourself a good jump rope too and use it daily for around 10-30 minutes. Do the following program of bodyweight exercises everyday. \n\nHindu Squats\nHindu Push-Ups\nBack Bridge\n\nTry to go 25-50 hindu squats with the goal of 500 eventually.\n\nTry for 25 straight Hindu Push Ups with the goal of 100-200 eventually.\n\nGo for a 30 second Back Bridge with the goal of reaching 3 minutes.\n\nFor a detailed explaination of these exercises go to www.bodybuilding.com and do a search. Or purchase the book Combat Conditioning at www.mattfurey.com .\n\nFor your abs do 3 sets of 50-100 crunches daily.\nFor your biceps get two 10lbs dumbbells and do 3 sets 20-50 reps three days a week (Mon, Wed, Fri or Tues, Thurs, Sat). You can get the dumbells from a sporting goods store like Dunhams or Sportauthority.\n\nHope this helps! STAY AWAY FROM STEROIDS!!!!!!!"

"2","Why does Michigan have Daylight Savings Time?","","Daylight Saving Time is there to try to make more efficient use of daylight hours and therefore use less electricity and other resources.\n\nDuring the summer months, there are several hours of daylight before most people are awake.  By moving the clocks forward, everyone in effect gets up one hour earlier and so uses some of that daylight.\n\nThe important bit to remember is that moving the clocks does not actually move time, it just means that we get up earlier and pretend that we haven't.  If you wake up at 6 normally, then moving the clocks forward by an hour means that you actually get up at 5 but your clock tells you that it is 6.  We could all save a lot of hassle twice a year by just leaving the clocks where they are stop pretending that we are still getting up at the same time.\n\nThe attached link has loads of information about it, but it does suffer from the delusion that moving the clocks actually moves time.\n\nQuote ""We change our clocks during the summer months to move an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening"".  Clearly total nonesense.  All it does is mean that we can do something an hour earlier than before but pretend that it is the same time."
"1","What is the difference between Zen Buddhism and regular Buddhism?","I am a Buddhist without ever set foot in any sort of Buddhist temple, just from meditating.","There are many forms of Buddhism and as you know, Zen is only one of them.  Zen is a form of Mahayana Buddhism. The Name Zen is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese Character Ch'an which was the name given to the Dhyana teachings of Buddhism. \n\nA few of the more distinctive teachings of Zen(Ch'an) are:\n- Zen puts a great deal of emphases on meditation. This includes traditional sitting meditation, walking meditation and meditation while performing daily tasks such as eating, working, etc...\n- Zen puts little emphases on textual studies. Zen practitioners do read the sutras, but unlike many other forms of Buddhism, the sutras are not considered the paramount in the achievement of enlightenment. \n- Some forms of Buddhism, such as most schools of Tibetan Buddhism as well as Pure Land schools of Buddhism have many ceremonies, and rituals. Zen has many fewer and less 'secretive' practices.  \n- The Use of the Koan.  Most other schools of Buddhism believe that Enlightenment comes from a deep understanding of the doctrines of Buddhism. Zen teaches the enlightenment is a spontaneous response that is NOT perpetuated by classical study and knowledge... It just happens. A koan is a question, statement or story that generally contains aspects that are inaccessible to rational understanding, yet may be accessible to intuition and thus lead to enlightenment. \n- Generally speaking, Zen puts less emphases on Buddha the man and more on Buddha's teachings. \n\nI hope this helps."

So, the formula equation for this reaction would be something like:\n\nKOH(aq) + HNO3(aq) --> H2O(l) + KNO3(aq)\n\nSince KOH, HNO3 and KNO3 are all strong electrolytes, they are totally ionized when they're dissolved in water.  So, written in complete ionic form, that equation would be:\n\nK+(aq) + OH-(aq) + H+(aq) + NO3-(aq) --> H2O(l) + K+(aq) + NO3-(aq)\n\nTo get to the net ionic equation, you just cross out the things that are the same on both sides of the arrow.  K+(aq) and NO3-(aq) are on both sides, so the net ionic equation is:\n\nH+(aq) + OH-(aq) --> H2O(l)"

Thanks.","Some of these questions would take a while to answer but I will try to keep this as simple and short as I can,\n\nWho are Judaism's religious leaders?  Most religious Jews study the writtings of their Sages and Rabbis that have lived throughout the ages.  A Rabbi is basically someone who  teaches Jews about Judaism.  Anciently, there was a court called the Sanhedrin that interpreted the laws and how to live by them.\n\nWhat does Judaism think about the worship or use of idols and images?  Strictly forbidden to worship or have images of God.\n\nWhat would their house of worship be?  Anciently it was the Beit Hamikdash (Temple) in Jerusalem.  Today its mostly done in a Synagogue.\n\nWhat are their beliefs about the ""Good Life"" and life after death.  \nThis one would take a lifetime to answer and there really are no clear answers.

"1","What is the best way to over come your fear?","U have to deal wit negitive, disappointment, and rejection. how do u look over that?","Everyone feels nervous or afraid at one time or another.  But, if you want to be successful and do everything you  want in life, you’ll need to overcome occasional attacks of fear. Eleanor Roosevelt once said: “You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing which you think you cannot do.”  It may make you feel uncertain to even think of attempting to do things that scare you, but isn’t it even more frightening to miss out on your dreams and aspirations? \n\nHave you ever done something that initially scared you, but then in retrospect you realized that it was not as scary as you originally thought? Your imagination had actually taken your fear and magnified it in your mind. Remember, your imagination is incredibly powerful. \n\nBefore you can eliminate fear from your life, you’ll need to identify exactly what it is that you fear. Start by forming a written list of things you want to do, but have avoided because of fear. It doesn’t matter if you have a few or a lot of items on your list, it is up to you to name them and begin to delete them – one fear at a time. Then, for each of your fears ask yourself the following questions. Each answer will help you understand more about your fears and move you closer to overcoming them.\n\n1. What is it that is making me afraid?\n\n2. Is this a fear I want to overcome and delete from my life?\n\n3. Am I allowing this fear to keep me from achieving my dreams?\n\n4. If I did the thing that I fear what would happen to me physically?\n\n5. What would happen to me mentally?\n\n6. Would the opinions of others matter to me if I did this? If so, why? \n\n7. What’s the worst thing that could happen if I did this? Could I live with this outcome?\n\n8. What’s the best thing that could happen if I did  this? Would this outcome make me happier than I am right now?\n\n9. If I never overcome this fear would I feel regret later in life?"
"2","What is 'space dust'?","","Well...interstellar dust comes from a variety of sources, but mostly from the atmospheres of very old stars. In the outer layers of these red giant and red supergiant stars, the temperatures are so low that dust grains made of silicon monoxide or graphite can condense like rain drops directly from the stars material. The dust grains are whafted into space by radiation pressure or by some mechanical means, and over billions of years and millions of stars, they form a persistent 'medium' of dust grains everywhere. As they collect along with interstellar hydrogen gas, into vast clouds, their surfaces become very chemically active and they serve as catalysts for forming complex molecules in the interstellar medium. Dust grains are the repository of most of the interstellar medium's 'heavy elements' beyond helium. There seems to be very little dust in intergalactic space, and most of the dust we can detect seems to reside within galaxies to one degree or another. Elliptical galaxies seem nt to have much of an interstellar medium at all, while some spiral galaxies are so loaded with dust that it extinguishes a significant fraction of the light from the other stars in the galaxy. Some galaxies have such tremendous episodes of star formation occurring that the dust in these galaxies converts nearly 100 percent of the light into infrared radiation and so you get ultra luminous galaxies in the infrared, but which are very hard to detect at optical wavelengths. Typical interstellar dust grains are about 1/2 of a micron in diameter, but can grow up to several microns or more in the deep dark cores of collapsing dust clouds. Eventually these dust grains stick together to form ever larger bodies all the way up to asteroids and planets!"

Yes, any chunk of space rock will be preturb as it is more influenced by another gravitational mass (Earth, Moon, even the Sun and Jupiter), but by the orbital data on this particular rock and the angle it is coming in on, I doubt the influence would be remotely enough to put it on collision course with Earth for any time soon."
"2","what did pythagoras contributed in mathematics?","tell all","""Pythagoras of Samos was a Greek philosopher responsible for important developments in mathematics, astronomy and the theory of music. He left Samos because of the tyrant who ruled there and went to southern Italy about 532 BC. He founded a philosophical and religious school in Croton that had many followers.\n\nAlthough the theorem now known as Pythagoras's theorem was known to the Babylonians 1000 years earlier he may have been the first to prove it.\n\nOf his actual work nothing is known. His school practised secrecy and communalism making it hard to distinguish between the work of Pythagoras and that of his followers. His school made outstanding contributions to mathematics.\n\nPythagoreans believed that all relations could be reduced to number relations. This generalisation stemmed from observations in music, mathematics and astronomy.\n\nThe Pythagoreans noticed that vibrating strings produce harmonious tones when the ratios of the lengths of the strings are whole numbers, and that these ratios could be extended to other instruments.\n\nThe most important discovery of this school was the fact that the diagonal of a square is not a rational multiple of its side. This result showed the existence of irrational numbers. Not only did this disturb Greek mathematics but the Pythagoreans' own belief that whole numbers and their ratios could account for geometrical properties was challenged by their own results.\n\nIn astronomy Pythagoras taught that the Earth was a sphere at the centre of the Universe. He also recognised that the orbit of the Moon was inclined to the equator of the Earth and he was one of the first to realise that Venus as an evening star was the same planet as Venus as a morning star.

If you get to that point, timing shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo - add more fiber to your diet.

However, probably the only fruit juice that will help is the OJ with extra pulp.  \n\nOrange peel is very good for fiber.  If you eat an orange, nibble on the peel when your finished.

As such the motion was not anticipated by the computational analysis of the bridge prior to construction. It is often thought that the unusually low profile of the suspension cables contributed to the problem, but an analysis by the structural engineer, Arup, shows that it can occur in any suspension bridge which happens to have the appropriate resonant frequencies. After extensive analysis, the problem was fixed by the retrofitting of 37 fluid-viscous dampers (energy dissipating) to control horizontal movement and 52 tuned mass dampers (inertial) to control vertical movement. This took from May 2001 to January 2002 and cost £5m. After a period of testing the bridge was successfully re-opened on 22 February 2002, and as yet there have not been any noticeable severe vibrations."

"3","What is Atenolol used for?","","Atenolol works by competing for receptor sites on, in atenolol's case, cardiac muscle. This slows down the strength of the heart`s contractions and reduces its oxygen requirements and the volume of blood it has to pump. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may be treated with these drugs because of their ability to increase the diameter of the blood vessels thus allowing blood to flow under less pressure. Some of these medicines include a diuretic to help reduce blood pressure by increasing the body`s excretion of excess fluid. Beta blockers are also used to treat Myocardial infarction (heart attack) and Arrhythmias (rhythm disorders), angina (chest pains), and disorders arising from decreased circulation and vascular constriction, including migraine."
"2","Why does Iodine show the least tendency of the halogens to form the iodide anion?","","Iodine is the least likely to form an iodide anion because it is the lest electronegative of the halogens. \n \nTHe halogens tend to want to draw and electron towards their neucleus.  Fluorine has the highest electronegativity.  It has a small electron cloud, so the outer most electrons are close to the nucleus and are more strongly pulled there.  Iodine has a large electron cloud.  The outer most electrons of iodine are much further away from the neuleus, so it can't pull electrons in as close.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nPS.  F, Cl, Br, and I all are diatomic, so they all form F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2."

"1","A simple question about GOD?","IF GOD IT'S THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF EVERYTHING. THE CREATOR!\nCAN GOD CREATES A PLANET SO BIG THAT NO EVEN GOD COULD CARRY IT?","Read this and substitute mountain, stone, rock whatever with planet.\n\nI am glad that I save these long answers. . . I would hate to type it in again (for the 6th time)\n\nGod and Omnipotence\nThe paradox of the stone, as presented by Wade Savage:\n1. Either God can create a stone that God cannot lift, or God cannot create a stone that God cannot lift – there are no other possibilities. \n2. If God can create a stone that God cannot lift, then there is at least one thing that God cannot do (i.e., lift that stone). \n3. If God cannot create a stone that God cannot lift, then there is at least one thing that God cannot do (i.e., create that stone). \n4. From the combination of 1, 2 and 3, it follows that there is at least one thing that God cannot do. \n5. If God is omnipotent, then God can do anything. \n6. Therefore, God is not omnipotent. \n\nWhat this argument apparently shows is that omnipotence is impossible (or, that the notion of omnipotence is incoherent). Thus, God cannot be omnipotent (as nothing can be).\n\nSuggested solutions to the paradox St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274):\nAquinas defines as “absolutely impossible” any thing where the “predicate is altogether incompatible with the subject” (his example: “man is an ***” (in the non-metaphorical sense)). With this in mind:\nWhatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it is more appropriate to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do them.\n\nThat is, to be omnipotent involves being able to do all things that are possible. For example, it is not considered a limit to my powers that I cannot draw a square circle. That’s impossible, so it’s no failing that I can’t do it – it cannot be done.\n\nBUT: surely I can make a thing that is too heavy for me to lift, so that task is not impossible, so if God can’t do it, that really is a limit to his power.\n\nGeorge Mavrodes (1926-):\nMavrodes responds that although “a stone too heavy for Simon Cushing to lift” is not a contradictory notion, “a stone too heavy for an omnipotent being to lift” is a contradictory notion.\nMavrodes’s argument in full:\n1. Either God is omnipotent or he is not. \n2. If God is not omnipotent, then the fact that he cannot do something (either make or lift the stone) is unsurprising. \n3. If God is omnipotent, then, by definition, there necessarily cannot be a stone that is too heavy for him to lift (otherwise he would not be omnipotent). \n4. If there necessarily cannot be such a stone, then it is an impossibility. \n5. By Aquinas’s reasoning, even an omnipotent being cannot perform impossibilities. \n6. Therefore, by definition, inability to create a stone too heavy for one to lift is no barrier to being omnipotent. (In fact, only non-omnipotent beings can create objects too heavy for themselves to lift.) \n\nBUT: both Aquinas and Mavrodes assume that God cannot do impossible things. Is this right? Descartes, for one, thought not. Descartes believed God could make 2+2=5. Why? Because otherwise you are suggesting that God is bound by the laws of logic. But if God created the laws of logic, why should he be bound by them? Couldn’t he have made them differently?\n\nHarry Frankfurt:\nHowever, if we assume that God can do impossible things, then God can create a stone too heavy for him to lift (which is supposedly impossible). Furthermore, if he can do that, then he can go one stage further and lift that stone (also impossible – but what’s the difference between doing one impossible thing and doing two?) \nBUT: doesn’t that mean that the stone he created was not a stone too heavy for him to lift, and that we’re back to the situation of him being unable to create such a stone? Not according to Frankfurt:\nIf an omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible, then he can not only create situations which he cannot handle but also, since he is"

It could be genotypic (one allele preventing transcription of another) or phenotypic (both alleles are transcribed, but one hides the effect of the other). If they are on the same chromosome, they wouldn't always sort independently; there'd be a high degree of linkage (like blond hair and blue eyes)."

The GFR in turn is the standard by which kidney function is assessed.\n\nA 24-hour urine sample generally required. Occasionally, 6- or 12-hour urine collections can be done alternatively. The health care provider will instruct you, if necessary, to discontinue drugs that may interfere with the test.\n\nOn day 1, urinate into the toilet when you get up in the morning. \nAfterwards, collect all urine in a special container for the next 24 hours. \nOn day 2, urinate into the container when you get up in the morning. \nCap the container.

"2","End of the world? Will it happen? When?","","Emerging scientific basis\nSee also: Timeline of cosmology and Timeline of the Big Bang \nThe theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity. General relativity can be employed to describe the universe on the largest possible scale. There are many possible solutions to the equations of general relativity, and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe. Alexander Friedmann proposed one such solution in 1921. This solution implies that the universe has been expanding from an initial singularity; this is, essentially, the Big Bang.\n\nAn important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This creates three possible ultimate fates of the universe, depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the Flat, Open and Closed universes. These three adjectives refer to the overall geometry of the universe, and not to the local curving of spacetime caused by smaller clumps of mass (for example, galaxies and stars).\n\nObservational evidence was not long in coming. In 1929, Edwin Hubble published his conclusion, based on his observations of Cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies, that the universe was expanding. From then on, the beginning of the universe and its possible end have been the subjects of serious scientific investigation. In 1933, Georges-Henri Lemaître set out a theory that has since come to be called the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe. In 1948, Fred Hoyle set out his opposing theory of a static universe, called the Steady state theory. These two theories were active contenders until the 1965 discovery, by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, of the cosmic microwave background radiation, a fact that is a straightforward prediction of the Big Bang theory, and one that the Steady State theory cannot account for. The Big Bang theory immediately became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe.\n\nWhen Einstein formulated general relativity, he and his contemporaries believed in a static universe. When Einstein found that his equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding now, and to contract in the far future, he added to those equations what he called a cosmological constant whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static. After Hubble announced his conclusion that the universe was expanding, Einstein wrote that his cosmological constant was his ""greatest blunder.""\n\nStarting in 1998, observations of supernovae in distant galaxies have been interpreted as consistent with a universe whose rate of expansion is accelerating. Subsequent cosmological theorizing has been designed so as to allow for this possible acceleration, nearly always by invoking dark energy and dark matter. Hence recent theorizing about the ultimate fate of the universe allows for a nonzero cosmological constant.\n\n[edit]\nRole of the shape of the universe\nSee also: Shape of the universe \nThe ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape, and on how much dark energy it contains.\n\n \nThe overall geometry of the universe is determined by whether Ω is less than, equal to, or greater than 1.[edit]\nClosed universe\nIf Ω>1, then the geometry of space is closed like the surface of a sphere.

"2","how does overpopulation effect ecological balance?","","Most systems, when left alone, will tend to come to a ""steady state"" or be at rest.  In the case of balancing the ecosystem, overpopulation is a situation that I tend to think would eventually be controlled by the environment.\n\nAs an example, consider bacteria and viruses for which not everyone is immune nor is there necessarily a vaccine.  The increase in population ensures: a) that there are more hosts for these agents to travel; and b) that the agent doesn't have that far to travel, so it does so quickly.  Epidemics have a way of balancing out overpopulation.\n\nIn some cases, people make the mistake of introducing some 'agents' (not necessarily viruses, but such as in a recent case with toads) into an environment in which they help control the population in one aspect, but then the agent itself overpopulates.  Eventually, as it runs out of food (unless it has several plentiful sources in the environment to which it's been transplanted) it too will experience a loss in population."

In my personal opinion (not that it really matters), you sound just a little thin, and that may be why your run time is a little slow, because if your body isn't in top-notch shape weight-wise and nutritionally speaking, you can't expect to get the most out of exercising because you body isn't really able to perform in that way. I think if you weighed a little more and ate properly and worked out with the guidance of a personal trainer and nutritionist/dietitian, you'd be doing great and be feeling terrific by Labor Day! Also, remember that getting enough sleep is crucial for your body to keep in tip-top shape, I'd say at least 7 hours a night."

"1","Why are Christians a target throughout the world?","","You've got to remember.  It's not about what we perceive as reality.  The Bible says there is a war in the ""invisbles"". . .the unseen.  It is a war against the principalities and powers of Satan.  Their objective is to supplant God.  Ålways has been.  God's objective is to redeem man, to get man back into fellowship with Him.  So, as Christians, we are in the family and Satan knows to bring whatever he has to bear against us.  Sex, war, terrorism. . .whatever.  Satan knows the Bible a whole lot better than we do and he is not afraid to jack us up royally.  He is the father of lies.  Satan's goal for us is self-destruction.  Since we choose to love God and follow Him, the only way Satan can really hurt God is to get us to choose to self-destruct.  He gets us where our weakness is and then just lets sin take it course. . .the end being self-destruction.  The world is just a part of that process.  There are really only two religions in the world.  Christianity and Hinduism.  Christianity says"" you need a God"".  Hinduism, which comes in many forms from  Mormonism to Humanism to whatever says 'you can be your own god.""  If you'll recall, that's just the same old lie Satan used in the garden and is still using today.  Hope that helps."

"3","Why do people shake in there sleep?","","Does it happen when you start to fall asleep?\n\nPeriodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD), also called nocturnal myoclonus, is a sleep disorder where the patient moves involuntarily during sleep. It can range from a small amount in the ankles and toes to wild flailing of all four limbs. These movements, which are more common in the legs than arms, occur for between 0.5 and 10 seconds, recurring at intervals of 5 to 90 seconds. A formal diagnosis of PLMD requires three periods during the night, lasting from a few minutes to an hour or more, each containing at least 30 movements followed by partial arousal or awakening.\n\nPLMD is a cause of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The incidence of this disorder increases with age. It is estimated to occur in 5% of people age 30 to 50 and in 44% of people over the age of 65. As many as 12.2% of patients suffering from insomnia and 3.5% of patients suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness may experience PLMD.\n\nIt is related to restless leg syndrome (RLS) in that 80% of people with RLS also have PLMD. However, most people with PLMD do not experience RLS.\n\nThis disorder has made its way into popular culture, being referred to as ""jimmy legs"" and ""jimmy arms"" in an episode of Seinfeld, and has been known to cause couples to sleep in separate beds. In both examples, one subject suffers from PLMD severely enough to disturb the sleep of the other subject.\n\nPLMD is treated by medications aimed at reducing or eliminating the leg jerks or the arousals. Dopaminergic agents such as carbidopa/levodopa, pergolide, and a newer drug, pramipexol, are the treatment of choice for PLMD, as they decrease or eliminate both the leg jerks and the arousals. These medications are also successful for the treatment of RLS restless leg syndrome. In one study, carbidopa/ levodopa was superior to propoxyphene in decreasing the number of leg kicks and the number of arousals per hour of sleep. However, carbidopa/levodopa and, to a lesser extent, pergolide may shift the leg movements from the nighttime to the daytime."

"1","Jesus, Bacchus, Dionysos, Osiris - your views on similarities in their worship?","I found some stuff on wikipedia about many things about the stories of Jesus and a number of rituals commonly performed by Christians. It really almost floored me to see the common thread that runs through all of them - if you don't know what i mean, look up Bacchus on wikipedia and check that out and it will have links to the others mentioned above. The one thing that I never even thought about is the implied cannibalism - eating the body, drinking the blood. I am not trying to be offensive (though I am likely succeeding in the view of some people), but it's amazing that I have never hear that addressed, nor any of the other similarities to the other 'gods'. (Don't wig about that word or capitalization, please. If He can forgive, He can forgive typos.)\n\nI know that there a lot more bona fide adults who reply to these questions, so I hope that I can get some interesting views on it. (Other than saying that it is morally out of bounds to talk about).","Many Christian customs are borrowed from idolatrous practices because they were fun and for political purposes to keep us all on the same page. Continuation of the same old story of man and thier governments. \n\n   The original sect of the Nazarene which was a sect of Judaism obeyed the first five books of the Bible which forbid the worshipping of Yahu'eh as the other nations worshipped their idols. Yahushua is Yahu'eh the Saviour. The flesh is the Son of man created by Yahueh thus the Son of Eloah/God. Eloah is a tile for Yahueh. \n\n   Satan counterfieted many of the seed of the woman issues in pagan religions to confuse this issue. The truth is though that none of the women that claimed to be virgins were but were vestel virgins secretly practicing temple prostitution in fertility worship through Nimrod, Astoroth/Easter/Istar/Semiramis/Artemis/Diana the many breasted idol ect... to numerous in names to mention. \n\n  Then after Yahu'shua the Messiah of Nazareth came about 2-300 years culminating in the reforms of Constantine the Great, a Mithra Sun Worshipper supposedly converted to Christianity, all the traditions and custom of this sun male, and moon female, fertility worship of images entered in and nearly wiped out true Messianic or Christian beliefs. This is the great falling away and grevious wolves the original 13 apostles warned us about in many places in the New Testament some even telling us this was already starting in it's infancy in their day.Jude 4, 1John, Paul's writings etc...\n\n  Why? So if you want to be decieved and ultimately worship&#92;bow down to idols which are demons with thier leader Haylel ha Satan or the Adversary then your true intention of your heart willbe revealed to all so that when you are not allowed into the kingdom of Yahueh our God it will be just and apparent to all. Yahushua of Nazareth told parables so that those that would not see & would not be in his kingdom which is a paraphrase of verses written to this effect in the New Testament quoting Yahushua."
"2","why is it important for mountain climbers to wear sunglasses and sunblock even when its below freezing ?","","UV radiation, the portion of sunlight that causes sunburns, increases 10% for every 1000 foot rise in elevation. Ask any skier if it is possible to sunburn in the winter at elevation.  \nSo, at very extreme altitudes, say above 15,000 feet you have 2 1/2 times the intensity of UV. The power of UV has nothing to do with ambient heat. Sunburned skin and eye damage is quick to occur at these altitudes."

They are portrayed as having once lived on earth before eventually ceding their direct rule to a line of human kings.\nTexts like the Am Duat ""That Which is in the Underworld"" from the New Kingdom, which are part of a larger tradition of religious texts like the Book of the Dead tell of the gods holding court in the underworld.\nHowever, Egyptian temples were also perceived by the Egyptians as houses for the various deities.  Statues were kept in the temples, they were bathed, dressed, had makeup applied to them and were ""fed"" daily by the priests and taken out on ""visits"" to other deities or to be paraded during various festivals.\nStatues in a broad sense in ancient Egypt were thought to be able to hold the soul or part of the soul of people and gods in order to receive offerings or to interact in some way with the living world.\nThere also seems to have been a belief that statues of various deities had healing powers as there are accounts of Egyptian deity statues being sent to other Near Eastern kings when those kings fell ill."

Once you take Steps 1 and 2, and get a decent score, there are many residency spots available for qualified foreign medical graduates (FMGs).\n\nOnce you finish residency as an FMG, depending on which visa got you here, the way to stay in the U.S. medical system working, is to go to an underserved area (inner city, rural community, VA hospital) and work there.  In the meantime, you can work on green card paperwork and permanent residency, which will allow you to work anywhere.\n\nIn terms of the environment of U.S. medicine, there is a great fear of litigation (lawsuits) which makes medicine a little bit overexhaustive and has emphasis on overdocumentation and paperwork.  There are few restrictions to the lenght of time and the intensity of care patients get.  \n\nCanada and the UK have more socialized medicine systems, where there are restrictions to the type of care people get (less ICU care, less dialysis), and wagewise, physicians make relatively less than US physicians, since many are salaried."

They also have a great tendency to pick and choose measurements rather than look at all the ones available. For example, Romer's original estimate of c was lower than the currently accepted one.\n\nUntlimatey, the goal of cDK is to make it possible for the universe to be only 10,000 years old ather than 13.7 billion.

"2","Why are earwigs so called?","And can they get stuck in our ears?","The name ""earwig"" is generally said to originate from an old European belief that earwigs crawl into people's ears and lay eggs in the brain. This etymology is given by the Oxford English Dictionary, which states unequivocally that the name is derived from Old English éare, ""ear"", and wicga, ""insect"", ""from the notion that it penetrates into the head through the ear."" Earwigs do tend to prefer being in hidden places, and this etymology parallels the unambiguous French name perce-oreille (""ear piercer""). Another hypothesis is that the word comes from the Late Latin auricula, owing to the ancient use of pulverized earwigs as medicine to treat diseases of the ear. A third explanation is that it is an alteration of ""ear-wing"", after the shape of the hind wings when unfolded."

"3","How do you brush your teeth without hurting you gums?","","Either you're brushing your teeth too hard or not often enough.  You should brush twice a day with a soft bristle toothbrush.  And floss daily.  Most people hold their toothbrush with a death grip and scrub hard.  Try holding your toothbrush with just your fingertips while brushing.  If your gums still hurt, then you probably have gingivitis.  If your gums are red, swollen, or bleeding, then they are infected.  Brush twice and floss once everyday, and rinse with Listerine or Crest Pro-Health Rinse daily also.  If you floss daily for a couple weeks, the bleeding should go away.  If left untreated, gingivitis can lead to periodontal disease, which causes tooth loss.  Periodontal disease can also contribute to the development of heart disease, pre-term low-birth weight babies, and complications with diabetes.  Take care of your teeth and gums.  Healthy gums do not bleed.  They are just like any other part of your body.  If your finger was always hurting or bleeding, you would be concerned.  You should also be concerned about your oral health.  Go see a dentist."

"1","Matthew 23:9 - ""Call no man Father""?","I posed a question recently about why Catholics call the Pope ""Holy Father"", and received one reply quoting the Bible and saying, ""In the bible it says ""call no man Father"" Are we to take this literally? Are Catholics wrong to call their priests ""Father""?","On occasion, you will encounter one of our separated brethren who will criticize Catholics because we call our priests ""father"", citing the verse above ""And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your father, who is in heaven."" (Mt 23:9 KJV) If one takes this passage literally, this might seem to be a fair criticism.\n\nWhat does this individual call their male parent? Daddy? Papa (which, incidentally, is Italian for Pope)? When they fill out a credit application, what do they put in the block which asks for their father's name - God? Obviously, there is meaning of this scriptural passage other than the literal one. This meaning is that there is only one Creator, from whom all ""fatherhood"" comes (Eph 3:14-15). This does not preclude addressing someone as ""father"", so long as you understand that all fatherhood (both biological and spiritual) originates with God the Father. We are all member's of God's family, a fact we acknowledge every time we recite the 'Our Father' or the Creed.\n\nSt. Paul calls himself a ""father"" in 1 Thessalonians 2:11 ""As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one you, as a father does his children."" (KJV) and again in 1 Corinthians 4:15 ""For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel."" (KJV). In both of these passages, St. Paul considers himself a spiritual father just as the priest is today. This same interpretation is presented by St. John in 1 Jn 2:13-14 where he says twice ""I write unto you, fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning."" (KJV).\n\nFinally, you might ask this individual if he or she is familiar with the New International Version (NIV) of the Bible (a common modern Protestant translation). If so, refer him or her to Matthew 23:10, the passage immediately after the one quoted to you: ""Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Messiah"". Even they have Sunday School teachers."

"2","can the mass weight of humans and relocated mass weight change abruptly the orbit of earth?","we are over populating with people in some areas, steel is being taken out of the soil, so its oil and other heavy items and distributed around the globe. could this unbalance the orbit of earth, like the tsunami did, the one that hit sri lanka and india.  what do you think?","not likely- no matter how many humans populate the planet, we make up  a very small fraction of the total mass of the earth,which is the same as it always was, since very little material has been removed from the earth since it was formed. The tsunami didn't affect the earth's orbit, it affected the rotation of the earth around its axis(sped it up by about one-billionth of a mile per hour) but didn't change the speed at which we travel around the sun(orbit) at all.no matter how we redistribute material around the planet we only change the weight distribution of the planet by a very,very small fraction so the effect will be unnoticable. the effect on this planet from human activity of any kind is much smaller than we think- greenhouse gas levels were far higher during the age of the dinosaurs than they are now (and humans didn't exist then). the amount of iron and other minerals we have taken out of the ground accounts for about onemillionth of a percent of the total amount still there. from out in space, you can't look at the earth and see anything that would suggest we live here, except the Great Wall of China and the light from our cities at night, so how great of an impact do we really have?"
"2","After the quake 26 dec 2004, What is the future of Andaman Islands  on Sumatra Andaman falt line?","What will be the effect of Andaman Islands due to quake.","""The Word "" ANDAMAN & NICOBAR ISLANDS & SUMATRA "" will be removed from the geographical area in another 10 million years since the eurasian plates are moving inch by inch .\n\nThe region where the great earthquake occurred on 26 December 2004, marks the seismic boundary formed by the movement of the Indo-Australian plate as it collides with the Burma subplate, which is part of the Eurasian plate. However, the Indo-Australian tectonic plate may not be as coherent as previously believed. According to recent studies reported in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters (vol 133), it apears that the two plates have separated many million years ago and that the Australian plate is rotating in a counterclockwise direction, putting stress in the southern segment of the India plate.\n\nFor millions of years the India tectonic plate has drifted and moved in a north/northeast direction, colliding with the Eurasian tectonic plate and forming the Himalayan mountains. As a result of such migration and collision with both the Eurasian and the Australian tectonic plates, the Indian plate's eastern boundary is a diffuse zone of seismicity and deformation, characterized by extensive faulting and numerous large earthquakes.\n\nThe epicenter of the 26 December 2004 earthquake was near the triple point junction of three tectonic plates where major earthquakes and tsunamis have occurred in the past.\n\nPrevious major earthquakes have occurred further north, in the Andaman Sea and further South along the Sumatra, Java and Sunda sections of one of the earth's greatest fault zones, a subduction zone known as the Sunda Trench. This great trench extends for about 3,400 miles (5,500 kms) from Myanmar (Burma) south past Sumatra and Java and east toward Australia and the Lesser Sunda Islands, ending up near Timor. Slippage and plate subduction make this region highly seismic. The volcanoes of Krakatau, Tambora and Toba, well known for their violent eruptions, are byproducts of such tectonic interactions.\n\nIn addition to the Sunda Trench, the Sumatra fault is responsible for seismic activity on the Island of Sumatra. This is a strike-slip type of fault which extends along the entire length of the island.\n\nThe Burma plate encompasses the northwest portion of the island of Sumatra as well as the Andaman and the Nicobar Islands, which separate the Andaman Sea from the Indian Ocean. Further to the east, a divergent boundary separates the Burma plate from the Sunda plate.\n\nMore specifically, in the region off the west coast of northern Sumatra, the India plate is moving in a northeastward direction at about 5 to 5.5 cm per year relative to the Burma plate.\n\nChronological Sequence of Major Aftershocks Along the West Coast of Northern Sumatra and in the Nicobar and Andaman Island Region Following the Major Earthquake om 26 December 2004\n\n\n MAGNITUDE   DATE  UTC-TIME  LATITUDE  LONGITUDE  DEPTH  REGION \n              \n 8.9  2004/12/26  00:58:51  3.298  95.779  10.0 West Coast of Northern Sumatra \n 5.9  2004/12/26  01:48:47  5.393  94.423  10.0 West Coast of Northern Sumatra \n 5.8  2004/12/26  02:15:58  12.375  92.509  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 6.0  2004/12/26  02:22:02  8.83  92.532  10.0  Nicobar Islands \n 5.8  2004/12/26  02:34:50  4.104  94.184  10.0 West Coast of Northern Sumatra \n 5.8  2004/12/26  02:36:06  12.139  93.011  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 6.0  2004/12/26  02:51:59  12.511  92.592  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 5.9  2004/12/26  02:59:12  3.177  94.259  10.0 West Coast of Northern Sumatra \n 6.1  2004/12/26  03:08:42  13.808  92.974  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 7.3  2004/12/26  04:21:26  6.901  92.952  10.0  Nicobar Islands \n 5.7  2004/12/26  06:21:58  10.623  92.323  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 5.7  2004/12/26  07:07:10  10.336  93.756  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 5.8  2004/12/26  07:38:25  13.119  93.051  10.0 Andaman Islands \n 6.5  2004/12/26  09:20:01  8.867  92.382  10.0  Nicobar Islands \n 6.2  2004/12/26  10:19:30  13.455  92."

"2","Where in the body you can't inject lidocaine with epinephren?","","I assume you meant epinephrine. Regardless, lidocaine/epinephrine injections, such as AstraZeneca's Xylocaine, should only be administered by a medical professional. He/she will know where the drug can and cannot be administered. I am not a physician nor a clinician. Therefore, I am not going to give medical advice. However, the information below (all obtained from Xylocaine's Prescribing Information) should answer your question:\n\nFor normal healthy adults, the individual maximum recommended dose of lidocaine HCl with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose not exceed 500 mg.\n\nXylocaine (lidocaine HCl) Injections are indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks.\n\nXYLOCAINE INJECTIONS FOR INFILTRATION AND NERVE BLOCK SHOULD BE EMPLOYED ONLY BY CLINICIANS WHO ARE WELL VERSED IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY AND OTHER ACUTE EMERGENCIES THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM THE BLOCK TO BE EMPLOYED AND THEN ONLY AFTER ENSURING THE IMMEDIATE AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN, OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS, CARDIOPULMONARY EQUIPMENT AND THE PERSONNEL NEEDED FOR PROPER MANAGEMENT OF TOXIC REACTIONS AND RELATED EMERGENCIES. DELAY IN PROPER MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY, UNDERVENTILATION FROM ANY CAUSE AND/OR ALTERED SENSITIVITY MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACIDOSIS, CARDIAC ARREST AND, POSSIBLY, DEATH.\n\nTo avoid intravascular injection, aspiration should be performed before the local anesthetic solution is injected. The needle must be repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by aspiration. Note, however, that the absence of blood in the syringe does not guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided.\n\nLocal anesthetic solutions containing antimicrobial preservatives, (eg, methylparaben) should not be used for epidural or spinal anesthesia because the safety of these agents has not been established with regard to intrathecal injection, either intentional or accidental.\n\nXylocaine with epinephrine solutions contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people."
"3","Why do some people who suffer with depression experience insomnia, while others all they do is sleep?","What are psychological reasons why this would occur?","Whether it is insomnia or excessive sleep; depression effects each person differently. Some people eat; some stop eating.\n\nChemical imbalances add up to the differences -and also the confusion as some medications work for some and don't work for others.

Most important thing is to learn to deal with stress. We have a lot of emotional stress and if you want to get better you have to drop some tons of emotional baggage. I ended up having a surgery, but that was a quick fix, or a bandaid solution ( I did have a herniated disk). Even after surgery I had issues.

"2","how is wind fomed?","","Quite simply it is pressure differences that create the phenomena that we call wind.\n\nAir moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. It is trying to ""balance"". The greater the pressure difference, the stronger the wind.\n\nWind direction is determined by where highs & lows are located. Since high moves in to replace low, that is how you will know which way it will move.\n\nThe sun is the ultimate ""driving force"" for the creation of wind. When the earth is unevenly heated it creates differences in pressure. Areas w/ more heat will tend to form low pressure b/c of rising air. Colder air tends to sink so it increases the amount of pressure exerted on us. This is called high pressure.\n\nModel of wind formation:\nSea Breezes occur when low pressure cells form over land during the day (warm air rising/low pressure); Meanwhile, pressure is higher over the ocean (b/c it is cooler here). Since the pressure is higher over the ocean, it will move from there to where it is rising (over land). Voila! Instant sea breeze.\n\n:)"

"2","box and whisker plots?","how do you pick out the numbers to use with a box and whisker plot when you have all the quartiles, and smallest and largest numbers?","A box-and-whisker plot can be useful for handling many data values. They allow people to explore data and to draw informal conclusions when two or more variables are present. It shows only certain statistics rather than all the data. Five-number summary is another name for the visual representations of the box-and-whisker plot. The five-number summary consists of the median, the quartiles, and the smallest and greatest values in the distribution. Immediate visuals of a box-and-whisker plot are the center, the spread, and the overall range of distribution.\n \n\n\nThe first step in constructing a box-and-whisker plot is to first find the median, thelower quartile and the upper quartile of a given set of data. Example: The following set of numbers are the amount of marbles fifteen different boys own (they are arranged from least to greatest).\n\n18 27 34 52 54 59 61 68 78 82 85 87 91 93 100\n \n\n\nFirst find the median. The median is the value exactly in the middle of an ordered set of numbers. *\n\n68 is the median\n\nNext, we consider only the values to the left of the median: 18 27 34 52 54 59 61. We now find the median of this set of numbers. Remember, the median is the value exactly in the middle oa an ordered set of numbers. Thus 52 is the median of the scores less than the median of all scores, and therefore is the lower quartile.\n\n52 is the lower quartile\n\nNow consider only the values to the right of the median: 78 82 85 87 91 93 100. We now find the median of this set of numbers. The median 87 is therefore called the upper quartile. \n\n87 is the upper quartile\n\n(*If you're finding the median in an ordered set with an even number of values, you must take the average of the two middle numbers. For example: 3, 5, 7, and 10. Add the two middle numbers. 5 + 7 = 12. Divided 12 by 2 to get the average. 12 / 2 = 6. Therefore 6 is the median for the ordered set of 3, 5, 7, and 10.)\n\nYou are now ready to find the interquartile range (IQR). The interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile. In our case the IQR = 87 - 52 = 35. The IQR is a very useful measurement. It is useful because it is less influenced by extreme values, it limits the range to the middle 50% of the values.\n\n35 is the interquartile range\n\nplease review these pages."

"2","what is the mechanism of leukocyte impairment in diabetics ?","","Leukocyte-Derived Myeloperoxidase Amplifies High-Glucose—Induced Endothelial Dysfunction Through Interaction With High-Glucose—Stimulated, Vascular Non—Leukocyte-Derived Reactive Oxygen Species \nChunxiang Zhang, Jian Yang, and Lisa K. Jennings \nFrom the Vascular Biology Center of Excellence, Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee \n\nVascular non–leukocyte-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), have emerged as important molecules in diabetic endothelial dysfunction. In addition, leukocyte-derived myeloperoxidase (MPO) has been implicated in vascular injury, and its injury response is H2O2 dependent. It is well known that MPO can use leukocyte-derived H2O2; however, it is unknown whether the vascular-bound MPO can use high-glucose–stimulated, vascular non–leukocyte-derived H2O2 to induce diabetic endothelial dysfunction. In the present study, we demonstrated that MPO activity is increased in vessels from diabetic rats. In high-glucose–incubated rat aortas and in carotid arteries from rats with acute hyperglycemia, vascular-bound MPO utilized high-glucose–stimulated H2O2 to amplify the ROS-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation via reduction of nitric oxide bioavailability. Hypochlorous acid (HOCL)-modified LDL, a specific biomarker for the MPO/HOCL/chlorinating species pathway, was detected in LDL- and MPO-bound vessels with high-glucose–stimulated H2O2. The results suggest that vascular-bound MPO could use high-glucose–stimulated H2O2 to amplify high-glucose–induced injury in the vascular wall. MPO/H2O2/HOCL/chlorinating species may represent an important pathway in diabetes complications and a new mechanism in phagocyte- and systemic infection–induced exacerbation of diabetic vascular diseases. \n\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Chunxiang Zhang, MD, PhD, Vascular Biology Center of Excellence, Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, 956 Court Ave., Coleman Bldg., H300, Memphis, TN 38163.

Especially when black people seem use these phrases between themselves.","Jeff A, take off your pointed hood and open your eyes.\nLet's look at it from a bigger picture and ask ourselves a couple of questions.\nWhat percentage of the Global population living under the poverty line is black, asian, colored?\nNo matter how you look at it, there is a corelation between the color of skin and prevalence of poverty.\nNow, slavery and colonialism have various debilitating effects. These effects take a lot of time to heal. Every civilization in the past has at one time or the other had slaves from other conquered cultures e.g Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Nevetheless, in none of these cases has the proportion of slaves to citizens come close to the prevalence of the United States. At the height of slavery in the US, there was 1 african slave for every 4 citizen.\nIn the case of previous civilizations, the negative effects of slavery have been greatly healed by the passage of time. It has been barely a century since slavery was abolished in the US, and just a copule of decades since civil right reforms were implemented in the south. It is over optimistic, to the point of naivette, to assume that societal and racial relations in the US would be normalized after only a copule of decades.\nThis brings to mind a skit in an episode of ""Family Guy"" where a colonial white man removes the shackles from his african slave and says ""Okay, its over now. We're cool, right?"".\nIt is understandable that minorities unconsciously feel slighted about the past and wish to strike back. In roman history, an army of escaped and former slaves led the Thracean Spartacus led a bloody revolt against the Roman populace.\nIn modern US society, It is sometimes taken as a subconscious mental victory that it is politically incorrect for a white person to say ""Ni99er"" while black people can refer to each other that way. These irrelevant mental victories help to heal racial problems in the society.\nBeing born and raised for the first 20 years of my life in a West African country, I have the advantage of being able to look at the US society from an outsiders perspective.\nFor anyone who says that the current US society is racially fair, I ask them to research the average family income for a black, hispanic, asian then caucasian family. Numbers dont lie, but ultimately, time heals all wounds (hopefully)."

"2","What is uranium used for?","","As uranium metal is very dense and heavy, depleted uranium is used by some militaries as shielding to protect tanks, and also in parts of bullets, kinetic energy penetrators and missiles. The military also uses enriched uranium (more than natural levels of 235U) to power nuclear propelled navy ships and submarines, and in nuclear weapons. Fuel used for United States Navy reactors is typically highly enriched in 235U.In nuclear weapons uranium is also highly enriched, usually over 90%  to a level known as ""weapons grade"".\n\nThe main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel commercial nuclear power plants, where fuel is typically enriched in 235U to 2-3%. However, the Canadian Candu reactors use natural uranium (i.e.unenriched) as fuel. Depleted uranium is used in helicopters and airplanes as counterweights on certain wing parts. Other uses include;\n\nCeramic glazes where small amounts of natural uranium (that is, not having gone through the enrichment process) may be added for colour. \nAddition of uranium makes fluorescent yellow or green coloured glass. \nThe long half-life of the isotope 238U (4.51 × 109 years) make it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating (including uranium-thorium dating and uranium-lead dating). \n238U is converted into plutonium in breeder reactors. Plutonium can be used in reactors, or in nuclear weapons. \nUranyl acetate, UO2(CH3COO)2 is used in analytical chemistry. It forms an insoluble salt with sodium. \nSome lighting fixtures utilise uranium, as do some photographic chemicals (esp. uranium nitrate). \nPhosphate fertilisers often contain high amounts of natural uranium, because the mineral material from which they are made is typically high in uranium. \nUranium metal is used for X-ray targets in making of high-energy X-rays"

When you touch a metal object (like a doorknob) that has very little electric charge, the charge is transferred to the other object.\n\nSo, the short answer is that to prevent the annoying shocks, you need to avoid building up electricity, or keep discharging it to objects. Touching metal frequently will help. Also, you can avoid some of the annoying effects by touching things with something other than your fingertips first - for example, the back of your hand. Your fingertips are very sensitive, and it may not be as unpleasant to get small shocks on other parts of your body."

"2","what do microbes need in order to reproduce and grow?","","A happy environment and the proper nutrients.\n\nMicrobes like all life, need the basics.\n\nShelter, in this case a substarte or media to grow. This could be agar in a test tube, or an infected cut on your hand. They need energy. This could be from the sun in the case of an algae or from nutrients found in a medium like blood.\n\nIf they have the basics, bacteria will grow and grow. Thisis why an infection can get out of control. The human body makes a great incubatr for bacteria and if unchecked they will take advantage of it.\n\nEach species is different in the specific needs. Some will like salt water, other will need more electrolytes, others need more protein, so it does matter what species of bacteria you are culturing. In a lab, this is usually done in an agar or medium. This is either a liquid or gel that is packed with certain nutrients and innoculated with the bacteria and incubated for growth."

"3","Why does peroxide foam and bubble when you put it on an infection?","","Peroxide bubbles because of the presence of a substance called catalase; which is a chemical found in your blood and in the cells of your body.  What catalase does is help speed up the chemical reaction which changes peroxide from H2O2 to H2O - water - and the chemical reaction taking place is what forms the bubbles."

"1","Don't Fundamental Christians have essentially the same relationship with God as Muslims?","I recently asked a question inquiring on the differences between the relationships of Christians, Muslims and Jews have with God.  Many people answered that Christians can have a personal relationship with God.  While a Muslim answered that Muslims are slaves to their mighty god.  Don't many fundalmental christians have more of a muslim attitude towards God?  Isn't it ironic how Fundalmental Christians act towards Muslims when they really think the same way?  Are my lofty assumption true or false?","Is it true Muslims consider they can not have personal relation with God ?\n\nMuslims believe all the prayers are to be directed only to God without any middle men like saints, prophets or any one else. Is that more personal than a person thinking God can be approached only through a middle man ? \n\n ""And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very near; I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right way. "" Quran 2:186.  \n\n ""And certainly We created man, and We know what his mind suggests to him, and We are nearer to him than his life-vein. "" Quran 50: 16.  \n\nMuslims consider their each 5 times prayer as a munajath, that is, a personal conversation with God.\n\nThe word servant can seen used for believer and unbelievers equally in Quran in the sense, even a non-believer is subject to God given natural rules and limitations"

"3","what is lipoma and what types of procedures are used to remove it?","","Lipomas are benign, slow-growing tumors that come from fat cells. They are not cancer. They are usually round, moveable, flattened lumps under the skin. They feel soft and doughy or rubbery. Lipomas usually grow in the neck, shoulders, back, or arms. They can occur at any age, but they often appear when you're between 40 and 60 years of age. Sometimes they run in families. Sometimes they are caused by an injury. Most lipomas\ndo not hurt unless they are squeezed or bruised.\n\nBecause lipomas are almost always benign (not cancer), they usually do not need treatment. If they are painful or are growing quickly, you may want to have treatment. Treatment options include steroid shots, liposuction, or surgery. Your doctor can help you decide what is best for you.\n\nAs always, check with your doctor to make sure it is a lipoma and to discuss treatment."

In 1989, contaminated l-tryptophan supplements caused a deadly form of eosinophilia known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.\n\nI've been taught that some people have an idiopathic increase in eosinophils, but suffer no ill effects from it.  I myself usually run somewhere in the 9-13% range.  However, 22% seems a bit high, and you should try to find out what's causing it."
"1","Do you think that racial discrimination exists?","Socially or at the work place? How widespread do you think it is and who gets discriminated against?","Racial discrimination exists and both socially and at workplace... \nThe following  is an episode featured on oprah's show that i myself had watched..\nDaniel, a barber from London, is one of few black men who actually knows what it's like to be white. Daniel conducted a radical race experiment. Through prostetics and makeup, he posed as a white man for three months.\n\n""I was invisible all of a sudden,"" Daniel says. ""I walked down the streets of London, and people didn't watch what I was doing, where I was in location to them, where I was in location to their pocketbook or their car. The other difference I found is when I go to shops, that's when they did look at you. They put the change in your hand rather than slam it on the counter and look to the next person. There's a difference in interaction.""\n\nAnother lesson Daniel learned was not to completely hold stock in his prejudices. In disguise as a white man, Daniel went to the dog races and chatted with a kind spectator. The man was someone whom normally Daniel would have judged to be a threat for a black man. When Daniel returned later as himself, the man treated him equally as kind.\n\n""It made me question myself,"" Daniel says. ""I have to look about how I look at other people and how I judge a whole race or a whole group of people, and if I don't want them to do that to me, then I can't do that to them. It made me look the other way."""
"1","is it a sin?","is it a sin for a black person and a white person to marry or be in  a intimate relationship?i was always told this growing up. however I personnally don't think so and no body has ever showed me where in the bible it would say such a thing. i WANT serious answers only... NO racial crap.... i just want proof that it is or isn't so i can show my family.","First we need to understand the concept of sin. In Christian theology sin is anything that separates us from God, other people or ourselves.  It is not, as some think, a list of thou shall nots.  One person's sin may not be another's, up to a point of course. The basis of the Law of Moses is the 10 commandments. And Jesus taught us that there are 2 things that we must do.  We are to love God, and love our neighbor. \n\nThere are some problem with mixed marriages from a  sociological POV. This is true for race, religion, social class, and culture.  It is easier to live with someone that is more like us and raised with the same social expectations and so on. Marriage is not easy, especially as children come along and you have different ideas of how they should be raised.  The more two people are able to agree on family customs the easier it is to live a happy married life."

"3","Do I still eat food with fat even though it has a low # of calories?","I want to know because I don't what's more important : fat or calories","Good question. There are a great number of debates about diets. But in general the best diet in the world is considered to be the japanese diet as it is the lowest in fat. If we look at this in isloation it interesting that rice plays a big role. Now rice is high in calories but low in fat. But they do tend to eat smaller amounts of food overall as opposed to a western based diet.  \n\nIn any case, it's up to you but what you need to consider is do you want to be lean and weight less, or just weigh less and not be too fussed about body fat. It is possible to be skinny and have a high % of fat. This normally leads to heart probs etc...\n\nI tend to follow a couple of rules when chosing my meals for reference: \n1) low in calories\n2) low in fats\n3) low GI\nIf a food has all three it's a goer.\n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - muligrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nNote that white carbs are lower in fats but are not a nutricious option overall. Your bidy still needs fats but make the right fat choices. Low in saturated vs unsaturated as a rule of thumb. \n\nGood luck hope this helped."

It is well known that external radiation (for example, gamma rays or x-rays) can cause all of the thyroid problems listed above. It is also known that internal exposure from radioactive iodine can cause hypothyroidism. However, it is still uncertain, due to the relatively few scientific studies that have been done, whether radioactive iodine (I-131) causes thyroid tumors in humans."

Are their any controls in place?",">>>>Specifically, how do rodenticides and insecticides kill pests?\n\nIf you want specificity I suggest you find a website that describes the mode of action. You are looking at a minimum of 10, 00 words if you want specifics, and no one is going to post 10, 00 words here.\n\nIn vaguely general terms however common rodenticides work by preventing the blood from clotting. This leads to bleeding into the joints and into the organs, and ultimately causes death from dehydration.\n\nInsecticides work by causing the nerves to fire continuously. That in turn causes the muscles to contract uncontrollably. The constant muscle contraction causes the insect  to die of exhauation.\n\n>>>>Am I limited to which ones I as a layman can buy for private use?\n\nYes, every state has its own restrictions on what licences are required for which pesticides. For example you can not but arsenic or fluoroacetate in any state as a layman although they are common commercial insecticides and rodenticides respectively.\n\n>>>Are their any controls in place?\n\nYes. In most states there are lists of restricted pesticides available only to licenced professionals. The restrictions and lists vary. You need to produce a licence to obtain the restricted substances."

It obviously depends on the compaction of the snow and the crystal structure. \n\nBy my calculations the commercial snowmaking machines use about 5 inches of water to one foot of snow, so it is obviously much denser than natural snow."

"3","help me if you can?","i just found out that my husband who has sickle cell anemia has pneumonia please help iam about to have an panic attack i am very scared some info. please something.","If you have any concerns I advise you talk to your Dr, because they will be able to apply all your husbands symptoms and answer your questions. I can only give speculative advice that is not to be taken as medical knowledge. Sickle Cell Anemia is a genetic disease (Born with it) of the Red Blood Cell where the molecule responsible for carrying Oxygen (Hemeoglobin) is made wrong. This causes the red blood cells to take a funny shape ""like a oval or sickle"". The person who has sickle cell anemia can suffer from many conditions resulting from the abnormal shapped Red Blood Cell. 1. Anemia - Which is low red blood cell count. Due to your body destroying the defective ""sickle"" shapped red blood cells. When your body destroys the red blood cells, you have a harder time delivering oxygen to your tissues and sometimes can be easily fatigued or tired a lot. 2. Patients with sickle cell anemia are also at an increased risk for blood clots because the blood vessels are good for transporting normal round red blood cells, but the sickle shapped ones tend to get stuck in some of them. Pneumonia is simply stated, fluid in the lungs because of some other cause. Usually it is because of a bacterial infection or sometimes a viral infection. There can be other causes too that can result in the lungs filling with fluid. The main focus is ensuring the person with the disease is getting enough oxygen to their tissues.

You have to feel sorry for them really, as they are so insecure that they have to tell one lie after another to make themselves sound interesting.  The really bad part though is when they tell lies about other people in order to make themselves look good or even just to make interesting conversation.\n\nIt's not a disease though and can be cured if they manage to raise their self-esteem; feel good enough about themselves and their lives so that they don't feel they have to make up lies to sound interesting.\n\nhttp://www.angelic1healing.com"

"3","how can i lose weight realy fast? i stay at work about 10 hours a day on the chair so i do'nt exercise much,","","Losing weight fast is dangerous for your health.  Do not lose more than 1 or 2 pounds a week.  Low carb diets are also dangerous--the 1960's taught us that.\n\nYou need a regular exercise program and a balanced diet high in fiber and low in fat.  Because you are inactive and overweight, you should consult a doctor before starting any exercise program (for your safety).  It is dangerous to eat fewer than 1200 calories a day, and it is dangerous to do too much exercise all at once.  Diet pills are basically ""speed"", and not good for you.  You want to eat a balanced diet of about 1400-1600 calories a day and do some fun exercise every day (aerobic exercise, which means it needs to get your heart rate up for a minumum of 20 minutes).  The exercise type doesn't matter--it could even be dancing if you jump around enough.  You just need to get your heart rate up for an extended period.\n\nIf you burn more calories than you consume, you will lose weight.  Remember that you burn a bunch of calories just living and breathing, and that is one reason not to eat fewer than 1200 calories a day.  The second reason is that your body needs nutrition to live.\n\nSee your doctor and take your time.  I wish you the best!"

OR okay, she can be scared that her g/f will try and kill herself (again). Bottom line, that girl is controling your friends life and its a very bad situation. Tell your friend to seek professional advice on how to get out of that relationship. She is being emotionally abused and needs to get out ASAP. Tell your girlfriend to call a hotline, get advice on how to leave and then just be there for her during the transition and so forth. IF your friend refuses to try harder and at least another month goes by then yes, move on. It may be very hard but at this rate its not fair to you. Good luck!"

"2","Why does life expectancy depend on where you live?","","The single biggest factor responsible for the correlation between life expectancy location is available medical care.\n\nThe vast majority of people in this world do not have access to even basic medical. If you live in many countries and you cut yourself badly, there is a good chance you will die simply because there are no doctors for thousands of miles around. The cut will become infected you will die, as simple as that.\n\nThink about it, have you ever had an operation in your life, like having your appendix removed? Ever had to take antibiotics? Ever had a wound stitched? If so then if you lived in much of the world there is a good chance you would now be dead. You wouldn’t have been able to get that degree of medical care.\n\nThen we look at other factors. Many countries don’t have any effective workplace safety rules. If you don’t; want to starve you have to do what you are told, even if it could kill you. Many countries have dirty drinking water supplies a which cause fatal diseases and so on and on.\n\nThat is why life expectancy correlates so well with location. When you add up all those factors there are places in this world where most people die before they turn 30.\n\n\nThis has nothing whatsoever to do with pollution and very little to do with diet. Diet these days is fairly trivial, and pollution causes so few deaths that it is almost impossible to detect statistically."

"2","why is the sky blue??","","The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.\n\nAs you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white."

That's how I found out about the history of this sign and New Yorks nickname.\n\nIn the 1920's Jazz musicians picked the term ""Big Apple"" up from horseracing people who considered New York races and gigs to be where the big money was. Since a horse, up for a big purse in New York City, can't get paid off in big money himself, the lingo promised him a big apple. At this time a night club opened in Harlem called ""The Big Apple"". Some historians think that New Yorks nickname may have come from this long forgotten club. The club is gone, the sign, with its upside down apple, is still there.\n\nFor another theory you may want to read this article from the Society for New York City History."

A normal heart rate can range between 50 and 80 beats per minute. The best way to take your pulse is to take your pointer finger and place it on the side of your neck. Relax and gently poke around until you feel the pukse. Count the number of beats for 30 seconds and multiply by two. This is your heart rate.  If you have pain in the chest or radiating down your arm, or if you feel as if someone is squeezing your chest and you can't breathe, you may be having a heart attack.

"2","What is genetic counseling?","Its for a science project. Is it just predicting what traits your baby will have or does it even involve chaing the baby's traits through Gene therapy?","Genetic Counseling has three main purposes.  The first is the testing of individuals for known genetic disorders, and then counseling these individuals about their options if they are susceptible to a given disorder, or cary a gene that can be passed down to their kids for this disorder.\n\nThe second purpose is to gather information about individuals with disorders and, with the patients permission, place that information into large databases along with scientific tests in order to help scientists understand the disease better from a genetic, and molecular, standpoint.\n\nThe last purpose is to gather information from individuals with a known disorder, but for which the causative genes are not well understood.  This includes lots of blood work, as well as gathering family information (and if possible samples from the family) to search out more information about these disorders.\n\nCounseling, as it stands now in america, can give you information about what your child may or may not have, and the chances that the child will show a given trait, but this is almost always relating to a genetic disorder.  As of yet, almsot no information is tested to look at ""hair color"" or anything else not life altering or threatening.\n\nSome disorders are able to attack using gene therapy, though almost all therapies used so far are minimally successfull at best.  \n\nTo put it simply, genetic counseling is about getting people ready for the consequences of having a child with sepcial needs, and allowing them time and opportunity to get ready for those needs.  It very rarely includes ways of ""curing"" these diseases using genetic therapies, though hopefully with the advent of stem cell research and retroviral therapies, this can change."
"2","What was the day on 15th August 1947???? Plzz tell me the solution..?","What i want to know is how to find the day of any given date and year???","Okay, this is not going to be pretty, but it works, but only for years from A.D. 1582 and later.\n\nFirst, let M equal the number corresponding to the chosen month according to the following list\n\nJan=11\nFeb=12\nMar=1\nApr=2\nMay=3\nJune=4\nJuly=5\nAug=6\nSep=7\nOct=8\nNov=9\nDec=10\n\nNext, let N equal the day of the month for which you are inquiring.  So if you want to look for August 15, M would be 6 and N would be 15 (M=6, N=15).\n\nNow, take the last two digits from the year you are searching for, call that number Y.  For 1947, Y=47.\n\nThe leftover digits of the year make a new number, call it C.  For 1947, after removing 47 we see that C=19.\n\nFinally, if the year is a leap year, let L=1, otherwise, let L=0.\n\nNow we're ready to get down to business.  The following formula makes use of the greatest integer function (ipart) which essentially means that if you get some number with a decimal, chop off the decimal.  3698.2461 becomes 3698.  OK?  Good.\n\nNow we must calculate the following formula:\nN + ipart(2.6M - 0.2) + Y + ipart(Y/4) + ipart(C/4) - 2C - (1 + L)*ipart(M/11)\n\nAfter calculating this number, divide it by seven and look at the remainder.  The remainder corresponds to the day of the week as follows:\n\n0=Sunday\n1=Monday\n2=Tuesday\n3=Wednesday\n4=Thursday\n5=Friday\n6=Saturday\n\nLet's test this with your August 15, 1947.\n\nSo, M=6, N=15, Y=47, C=19, and since 1947 was not a leap year, L=0.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula we get:\n15 + ipart(2.6*6 - 0.2) + 47 + ipart(47/4) + ipart(19/4) - 2*19 - (1 + 0)*ipart(6/11)\n\n=15 + ipart(15.4) + 47 + ipart(11.75) + ipart(4.75) - 38 - 1*ipart(.5454545454)\n\n=15 + 15 + 47 + 11 + 4 - 38 - 0\n\n=54\n\nDividing this by 7, we get a remainder of 5.\n\nThis says that August 15, 1947, was a Friday."
"2","How would I write this in a quadratic function for this parabola?","the maximum value is 6\nx intercepts are -2 and 4\nplease show how!","Here is how:  The axis of symmetry occurs halfway between the x-intercepts.  That is x = 1.  So the vertex is (1,6).\n\nThe vertex form of a parabola's equation is y = a(x-h)^2 + k\nwhere (h,k) is the vertex.\n\nSo we know it's y = a(x-1)^2 + 6\n\nFinally to find a, plug in the known coordinates of a point other than the vertex, say (4,0) since those are the coordinates of an x-intercept.\n\n0 = a(4-1)^2 + 6\n\n0 = 9a + 6\n\na = -6/9 or -2/3\n\nSo the equation is y = -2/3 (x-1)^2 + 6\n\nIf you need a different form, multiply it out but this should suffice.  Hope that helps explain what to do."

"2","explain the difference between a protostome and a deuterostome?","","Protostomes (from the Greek: first the mouth) are a taxon of animals. Together with the deuterostomes and a few smaller phyla, they make up the Bilateria, mostly comprising animals with bilateral symmetry and three germ layers. The major distinctions between deuterostomes and protostomes are found in embryonic development. In protostome development, the first opening in development, the blastopore, becomes its mouth. In deuterostome development, the blastopore becomes the animal's anus. Protostomes have what is known as spiral cleavage which is determinate, this meaning that the fate of the cells is determined as they are formed. This is in contrast to deuterostomes which have radial cleavage that is indeterminate.\n\nDeuterostomes (taxonomic term: Deuterostomia; from the Greek: ""second mouth"") are a superphylum of animals. They are a subtaxon of the Bilateria branch of the subregnum Eumetazoa, and are opposed to the protostomes. Deuterostomes are distinguished by their embryonic development; in deuterostomes, the first opening (the blastopore) becomes the anus, while in protostomes it becomes the mouth.\n\nThere are three phyla of deuterostomes:\n\n    * Phylum Chordata (vertebrates and their kin)\n    * Phylum Echinodermata (starfishes, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, etc.)\n    * Phylum Hemichordata (acorn worms and possibly graptolites)\n\nThe phylum Chaetognatha (arrow worms) and the isolated genus Xenoturbella may also belong here. Extinct groups may include the phylum Vetulicolia. The term Ambulacraria is sometimes used for the phyla Echinodermata and Hemichordata, as well as Xenoturbella.\n\nIn both deuterostomes and protostomes, a zygote first develops into a hollow ball of cells, called a blastula. In deuterostomes, the early divisions occur parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis. This is called radial cleavage, and also occurs in certain protostomes, such as the lophophorates. Cleavage is indeterminate - the cells' fates are not determined early on. Thus if the first four cells are separated, each cell is capable of forming a complete small larva, and if a cell is removed from the blastula the other cells will compensate.\n\nIn deuterostomes the mesoderm forms as evaginations of the developed gut that pinch off, forming the coelom. This is called enterocoely.\n\nBoth the Hemichordata and Chordata have gill slits, and primitive fossil echinoderms also show signs of gill slits. A hollow nerve cord is found in all chordates, even tunicates (even if it disappears in the adults). Some hemichordates also have a tubular nerve cord. In early embryonic stage it looks like the hollow nerve cord of chordates. Because of the degenerated nervous system of echinoderms it is not possible to discern much about their ancestors in this matter, but based on different facts it is quite possible that all the present deuterostomes evolved from a common ancestor which had gill slits, a hollow nerve cord and a segmented body. It could have resembled the small group of Cambrian deuterostomes named Vetulicolia."

I was only 17 at the time and they had the final say. Now I am 18 and my boyfriend that I have been with since I was 13 have a place of our and he takes good care of me. We want to start a family. We are going off to get married on Friday so all of the negative comments I got you can keep them. all I need is helpful advice.","I have to try to help u, will go to the abortion issue later, 1st about the getting married, I also got married at 18, we were together all thru high school, I did just what u r going to do, but that is many yrs. ago wish I was 18 again!! Please dont make my mistake, I ended up staying married to him for 18yrs. I was so unhappy, that is a long story, but the bottom line is I did finally get a divorce, why look back now. What I ask u to do is ask yourself and be honest to yourself, why r u wanting to get married so fast? Please when u read this understand this is no judgement against your boyfriend, I want u to just sit by yourself and really give this thought, it took me yrs. to be honest with myself, I was finnally honest and my answer was I wanted to leave home, my father was a alcholic, I wanted also to be taken care of, even though I worked, I  just had to show everyone how grown up I was, needless to say he was not the same after we married, and as the yrs. went on seemed he was still thinking and treating me as if I were still a teenager! Please u and your boyfriend talk and ask each other if its real love why not just wait, your together anyway, but r u so sure or would just a 6 month wait help u both to be sure, I just want u both to be happy, wish I had been given advice, even if u dont wait at least I hope u r sure, remember I was 18 at one time to, hell never even thought or knew how fast time goes by! Whatever you and him decide I wish u both the best and my blessing, as for the abortion u cannot look back now, and believe me no one has the right to judge u, my situation was different but I had to have a abortion, my 2nd husband and I have been married 13 yrs now,happy yrs. and I became pregnant our 1st yr. but come to find out I had a tumor that made having a baby dangerous, I know what a abortion is, scary and of course sad no matter what the circumstance, I also have a friend since 7th grade and her parents made her have a abortion so in a way I know how u must feel, if its anything like my friend, she was a mess, and bitter with her parents, I can only imagine how scary it must be to be in a abortion clinic at such a young age,and against your will! It makes me sad to think of it, you went thru hell and o thers dont have a clue, unless they have been there! But dont worry u just like my dear friend will when its the right time have a beautiful healthy baby, and I just know u will be the best mom! By the way that friend I told u about was only 14 at the time, she stayed with her boyfriend and they were married at the age of 20 and this yr will be their 30th anniversary!! See were old now!!! Big 50!!LOL, and they have 2 wonderful sons, and now a grandbaby!!! All will go well for u just make sure u r doing what is right for u!! If u do get married now, please take at least a yr.before having your baby, that way u have time to enjoy each other, and be more stable. Once u have a baby believe me its a whole new life, dont take this wrong I loved having my daughter, the feeling was like oh what a miracle!!! But u have so many changes remember u and your husband will be responsible for a new life!!! Now thats amazing when u look at it that way! You will want more for your child than u had we as good parents do, remember the most precious gift u will ever give your child no matter how old he or she is will always be your love,time, and support,and beyond even that make sure your child can always come to u and talk, I wish I could have with my parents, but I never could! My daughter always could and still does and I cant believe she is 30 see what I mean how fast time goes by!!! I have a grandson so I have been blessed again! Bless u and do whats in your heart, but give my words some thought, wish u the best in life!!"

Basically, an OP amp is comparable to a single transistor except that an OP amp has 2 inputs. One input can except positive input, and the other input accepts negative signal. OP amps have high input impedance in the order of 1megaohm or more. The output impedance is in the order of roughly around 75 ohms. You can use it as an open or closed loop -- meaning that the output of an OP amp is fed back to either the negative or positive input. One thing about OP amp is that it has infinitely high output gain when operated as open loop, whereas in close loop you can adjust your gain via using a larger resistor on the feedback loop line. The gain is determined by feedback resistor divided by input resistor. Is this too deep for you? Let me back up a little.\n\nAn OP amp can be used as an audio amplier, or RF amplier. \nIt is widely used in practically every application whether it is a car stereo, TV, home stereo, computer, and just about anything that involves electronics nowadays."

You may drink a glass of water before going fresh. If you don't do that, that do 2.\n2. In Morning,After having teethbrush, Take a glass of lemon water with excess salt. (half lemon, one teaspoon salt in a glass of water).Wait for 10-15 minutes. You will be called.\n3. You should do some stomach excercise. You may do yoga, especially kapalbhati is very useful for digestion.\n4. You should go for morning walk or take a small run.\n5. Care what you eat in breakfast.Neither miss breakfast nor  combine it with lunch. Over-eating habit as well as empty stomach both lead to bad digestion.  \n6. Dinner should be lighter than lunch.and After dinner, GO FOR A WALK before going to bed.\n7. State of your mind also matters. If your are stressed, depressed or worried, your digestion system may be disturbed.\n8. Increase the intake of fiber / digestive enzymes.You may take one apple daily in breakfast.\n9. Decrease intake of much oily & spicy food & meat.\n10. Don't take cold water, coffee/tea with meal.\n11.

My Mom doesn't like the fact that my girlfriend isn't Asian. I feel that this shouldn't be an issue, because my Dad is white, thus I'm also the result of an interracial marriage.\n\nI look Asian tho, so the relationship looks like just another Asian/White relationship from anyone's perspective.\n\nBut anyway, my Mom is worried that I'll one day end up marrying a non-Asian women. There's a good chance that could happen, because I don't limit myself to any certain race/ethnicities when dating. This is America.\n\nMy Mom is Thai and she feels that it could be a loss of culture or add to her isolation. I think she'd be much happier if she lived in Thailand.\n\nSo anyway, how do I juggle the fact that there's a good chance that I one day won't marry an Asian woman with the fact that my Mom wants me to marry an Asian woman? She married a white guy and had me as a kid, so I thought that it shouldn't be an issue.","I hurt with you. A lot of things should not be an issue, but they are in family situations.

The cost per mission rapidly falls as the number of missions increases.  Lets assume the development and deployment of a fleet of new Earth-Moon spacecraft costs $100,000,000,000.

"2","how does knowledge of principles of physics help in understanding plate tectonics?","","Plate tectonics is deeply connected with physics, and was discovered by geophysicists using techniques from physics.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Fluid mechanics\n2. continuum mechanics\n3. electromagnetism\n4. newton's laws\n\nPlate tectonics was discovered by looking at stripes of magnetization on the sea floor. These are from the earth's field, which is caused by a dynamo, which is very complicated physics, involving electromagnetism and fluid mechanics. The plates move because of entrainment by moving fluids beneath. There is a lot of thermodynamics involved in the heat transfer and the cooling of the plates after they emerge from a midcean ridge; they contract as they cool. There is continuum mechanics involved in the deformation of the plates as they collide or get subducted. Islands on the plate surface can cause the plates to flex, and this is studied by continuum mechanics. One could make a very extensive list, that would probably include quantum mechanics, and even nuclear physics (which creates the heat that drives the plates), and only exclude quantum effects."

"3","HOW CLOSE ARE THEY TO FIND A WORKABLE CURE OR TREATMENT FOR HIV/AIDS? MY BEST FRIEND HAS IT AND TIME'S GOING!","","Unfortunately, HIV is able to alter itself when it reproduces, so finding a vaccination is difficult, because vaccinations have to be very specific to the virus' structure. Another unfavorable situation is that virus are so small, it is very difficult to study them without killing them first-they cannot be observed on a normal microscope like bacteria can. So studying what will be affective against them in a laboratory is difficult. Also, as opposed to bacteria, which are closer in structure to plants-viruses are made up of closer to the same things animals are made of, so finding things that will work on the virus without killing or damaging the person, too-is difficult. Therefore, most likely-cures and vaccines are probably far off in the distant future. However, new and more effective treatments are very possible. The average life span of persons infected with HIV has increased tremendously. Science is becoming much better at treating the opportunistic diseases and conditions that are caused by HIV infection. So the good news for your friend is that his/her chances of living a longer and healthier life with HIV are better than they ever have been."

"1","Can someone give me examples and the meaning of the indicative and subjunctive mood?","Is conditional, and imperfect moods too? If so, what do they mean?","The subjunctive mood is used to talk about imaginary or unreal situations or a desire like ""If I were an animal I would be a dog""...you're obviously not an animal and never will be...and you're right it is often used in conditional sentences...another case of subjunctive is when it's used with wish like ""I wish I were a millionaire"" or ""I wish I had lots of money""...In English you use the past tense to form the subjunctive and if you need to use the verb to be, use ""were"" with all pronouns (I were, he were, she were, we were, etc) although when speaking many people say ""If I was""...\n\nThe conditional mood is the one that expresses lack of certainty and it occurs especially but no only in conditional sentences.  There are five types of conditional\n\nthe zero conditional expresses a situations that's always true or often happen, for example ""If I have a headache I take an aspirin""\n\nthe first conditional expresses a situation which is likely to happen in the future, for example, ""If it rains this afternoon I won't go out""\n\nthe second conditional is about a situation which is unreal or unlikely to happen, like ""If I became the president of the US, I would abolish taxes""\n\nthe third conditional talks about a past situation which has already happened and therefore it's impossible to change, like ""If I had gone to the party yesterday I would have had lots of fun""\n\nthe mixed conditional is similar to the third only that the consequence of the action is still visible in the present like, ""If penicillin hadn't been discovered, many people would die from infections""\n\nThe indicative mood is the one we use to establish a fact or something that is true like ""The Earth is round"". ""I am a student"", ""I went to a party yesterday""...It's the most commonly used mood and there is an indicative form for present, past and future\n\nThere is no such thing as the imperfect mood...the imperfect is a verb tense, although it is not called so in English...the English equivalents to other languages' imperfect tense are for example I was eating or I used to eat, that is, the past progressive, etc...in English only the subjunctive has an imperfect form which is the one I explained to you before (I were, she were, etc) as oppossed to the present subjunctive which is not very common and can be seen in sentences like ""She requests that he come to the meeting tomorrow""...as you can see the -s is not used with the third person in this case...\n\nok I hope I was clear enough, please let me know if you still have any doubts!"

"2","what is the lorenz test and how is it used for credit scoring?","","The Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the cumulative distribution function of a probability distribution; it is a graph showing the proportion of the distribution assumed by the bottom y% of the values. It is often used to represent income distribution, where it shows for the bottom x% of households, what percentage y% of the total income they have. The percentage of households is plotted on the x-axis, the percentage of income on the y-axis. It can also be used to show distribution of assets. In such uses, some political doctrines (e.g. socialism) consider it to represent social inequality.\n\nAnd below is a link to how it is used for credit scoring.

"2","How do birds fly long distances without flapping their wings?","","Once birds get up in the air, they use two main flying techniques to stay up there.\n\nSoaring: When birds soar, they take advantage air currents to help hold them up. Three kinds of air currents are especially helpful to soaring birds. \n\nThermal air currents develop in places where the air is warmer in one spot than an adjoining area, such as a paved road alongside a snowy field. Even on a very cold day, the sun will heat the pavement at least a few degrees more than the snow. This slightly warmer air is slightly lighter than the colder air, and rises. This rising air current can lift very light objects, like feathers and hollow bones. The birds that most often take advantage of thermals (like the hawks that fly along coastlines) usually have very wide wings and tail. This makes the area of their wings very large compared to their body weight. \nUpdrafts, also called obstruction currents, develop when wind hits an obstruction, like a cliff or a building. The rushing air has to go somewhere, so it goes up, and can carry a bird up with it. Birds who fly on updrafts (like the many hawks that migrate along Hawk Mountain, Pennsylvania) also have very wide wings and tail. \nWind moving toward a bird with spread wings can hold the bird up, thanks to the airfoil shape of the wings. Birds that fly on moving air currents often have long, narrow wings, such as gulls and albatrosses. \n  \n \nFlapping: When birds flap, the stroke of their downbeat moves the wing tips forward and downward. The wingtips make a loop at the bottom of the downstroke, and as the wings move up, the wing tips move upward and backward. In the downstroke, the pressure is higher below the wing than above, causing lift. And as they move forward, the rush of air on their airfoil wings causes more lift. But because flapping birds have smaller wings than soaring birds, they must move forward faster to stay in the air. Most songbirds must fly at least 11 miles per hour to stay up. One scientist calculated that for an ostrich to stay aloft, it would have to take off and maintain a minimum speed of 100 miles per hour. Birds who use their wings to flap more than soar often have smaller wings than soaring birds."

Since this seems to be more about general communication than actual speeches, its a lot less formal most of the time. If you are worried that people will make fun of you, try to stay current with whatever is going on in the group your involved in. If you are in a group of people who like movies, you know that if you havent looked up movies in a while you might be a bit out of place. Theres no real set science to being able to talk in groups. It really does help to be comfortable with your views and opinons. People usually want to hear other peoples opinions. A lot of times people feel nervous talking in groups but if you start getting involved you find that people will be affirming and it gets a little easier. Im not saying you have to be the life of the party right away. If someone says something you agree with, say that you feel the same way. Take baby steps. Soon you might feel a little more comfortable as people are a little more positive.

Good luck with you're project.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nSmith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a distinct and clinically recognizable genetic disorder characterized by a specific pattern of physical, behavioral, and developmental features. SMS, which was first described in the early 1980's by Ann C.M. Smith, MA (a genetic counselor) and Ellen Magenis, MD (a cutogeneticist), is the result of a deletion of chromosome 17 (17p11.2). The chromosomal deletion occurs from a spontaneous genetic change (mutation) that happens for unknown reasons, therefore, it is not a familial disorder. SMS is considered a rare disorder and is estimated to occur in 1 out of every 25,000 live births. Currently there are over 100 cases reported, however, it is believed that SMS is widely underdiagnosed because clinical features may be subtle. It is expected that with increased awareness, the number of those identified as having SMS will increase."
"1","Where did AIDS come from and do you think there is a cure somewhere that hasn't been exposed?","This question came from my friend insisting that AIDS is a man made disease (which I believe) and that Majic Johnson has the cure. Some person told me it came from a monkey another said from gay people (although I absolutely don't believe). What do you think?","I thought this was an amazing article. It was just published a few days ago:\n\nWASHINGTON - Twenty-five years after the first AIDS cases emerged, scientists have confirmed that the HIV virus plaguing humans really did originate in wild chimpanzees, in a corner of Cameroon.\n\nSolving the mystery of HIV’s ancestry was dirty work. Scientists employed trackers to plunge through dense jungle and collect the fresh feces of wild apes — more than 1,300 samples in all.\n\nBefore that, it took seven years of research just to develop the testing methods to genetically trace the primate version of the virus in living wild chimps without hurting the endangered species.\n\nUntil now, “no one was able to look. No one had the tools,” said Dr. Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. She led the team of international researchers that reported the success in Friday’s edition of the journal Science.\n\n“We’re 25 years into this pandemic,” Hahn said. “We don’t have a cure. We don’t have a vaccine. But we know where it came from. At least we can make a check mark on one of those.”\n\nScientists long have known that nonhuman primates carry their own version of the AIDS virus, called SIV or simian immunodeficiency virus. But with one exception, it had been found only in captive chimpanzees, particularly a subspecies that in the wild populates mostly West Africa.\n\nIt was not known how prevalent the virus was in chimps in the wild, or how genetically or geographically diverse it was, complicating efforts to pin down the jump from animal to man.\n\nHahn’s team tested chimp feces for SIV antibodies, finding them in a subspecies called Pan troglodytes troglodytes in southern Cameroon.\n\nChimps tend to form geographically distinct communities. By genetically analyzing the feces, researchers could trace individual infected chimps. The team found some chimp communities with infection rates as high as 35 percent, while others had no infection at all.\n\nEvery single infected chimp had a common base genetic pattern that indicated a common ancestor, Hahn said.\n\nThere are three types of HIV-1, the strain of the human virus responsible for most of the worldwide epidemic. Genetic analysis let Hahn identify chimp communities near Cameroon’s Sanaga River whose viral strains are most closely related to the most common of those HIV-1 subtypes.\n\n“The genetic similarity was striking,” Hahn said.\n\nThe first human known to be infected with HIV was a man from Kinshasa in the nearby country of Congo who had his blood stored in 1959 as part of a medical study, decades before scientists knew the AIDS virus existed.\n\nPresumably, someone in rural Cameroon was bitten by a chimp or was cut while butchering one and became infected with the ape virus. That person passed it to someone else.\n\nThe Sanaga River long has been a commercial waterway, for transporting hardwood, ivory and other items to more urban areas. Eventually, someone infected made it to Kinshasa.\n\n“How many different transmission events occurred between that initial hunter and this virus making it to Kinshasa, I don’t know. It could have been one, it could have been 10, it could have been 100,” Hahn said. “Eventually, it ended up in an urban area, and that’s where it really got going.”\n\nSomewhere in all that spread, the virus became more deadly to people than it is to chimps, who seldom are bothered much by SIV.\n\nThe research seems to settle any question of HIV’s origin, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health’s AIDS chief.\n\nWhen tracing a virus’ evolution, “it’s important to get as close to the source as you can,” he said. “It’s of historic interest.”"

He or she should be proud of the service that he or she renders to your community.\n\nMake sure that your doctor is willing to listen to what YOU want from him or her when you need treatment, rather than dictating to you what he or she want's you to do.\n\nDoctors forget all too easily that patients are customers.  Find one who hasn't.\n\nDon't worry so much about knowledge and credentials.  They all have them, and only another doctor will know if they're any good."

This value is denoted by the letter c, reputedly from the Latin celeritas, ""speed"". Note that this speed is a definition, not a measurement, since the fundamental SI unit of distance, the metre, has been defined since 1983 in terms of the speed of light—one metre is the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. The speed of light through a transparent medium (that is, not in vacuum) is less than c; the ratio of c to this speed is called the refractive index of the medium."

He will break the cross, kill the pigs and become a just Judge."" \n\nSome Muslim scholars interpretation on this saying is: ""Jesus will not  break the cross one by one and also kill the pigs one by one which is quite impossible but rather it signifies that people will turn into the folds of Islam in abundance leaving their old beliefs. He will then become a worldly Judge for humans not of his own will but of the will of He who send him which is Almighty God.""\n\nHope this answers your question."

This is an easy-to-fix problem and be sure to let the provider know you are on a budget.  There are some standard medications that are cheaper than others and do the job 95% of the time.  I'd estimate with Rx, you can do it for $50-60 dollars, maybe cheaper.  Check around.  \n\nA second thought.  Does you campus have a student health center.  That certainly would be the cheapest.  Look into it.\n\nA third thought.  Some towns have low income or volunteer health clinics that will see you.  I used to volunteer at one.  We asked for a $5 donation which included being seen and medication...what a deal.\n\nDon't go to the ER - the bill will be five times that of an urgent care.  In the ER it is their job to prove this is not an eye emergency and that takes time and dollars.  A hospital does have to evaluate you whether you have insurance or not but they do not have to treat you if you are not experiencing a life and death issue.

Heat is actually the motion (really kinetic energy) of atoms (since we're talking about an element).  Lower heat (and lower temperature) mean less motion.\n\n-273 C (or 0 degrees Kelvin) is known as ""absolute zero"".  It is the temperature at which that heat motion stops and kinetic energy goes to zero.  Since an atom cannot have negative motion or negative mass, its kinetic also cannot be zero and therefor its temperature cannot be less than absolute zero."

EXERCISE\n     a.  Cardiovascular (at least 4 to 5 times per week):  \n          1.  Run/jog - worked best for me\n          2.  Any type of cardiovascular exercise (eg.  aerobics, stationary bike, elliptical trainer, kickboxing) will burn fat if done for the correct amount of time and intensity (minimum of 30 to 45 minutes done at your target heart rate).\n           3.  Invest in a good heart rate monitor and good running/training shoes.\n      b.  Strength Train\n           1.  Lift weights 2 to 3 times per week.\n           2.  Incorporate a routine for your entire body, not just your legs.\n           3.  Weight training will increase your metabolism.  The more muscle you have, the more calories your body will burn even at rest.\n           4.  Do not train the same body part on consecutive days.  Give your muscles 48 hours to recover and rest.\n           5.  Don't buy into the theory that lifting weights will give you bulky muscles.\n     c.  Stretching/Yoga/Pilates\n           1.  Do some form of flexibility work for your muscles a few times a week to stay pliable and limber.\n           2.  This will also decrease your risk of injury.\n\n2.  NUTRITION - Some basic info:\n     a.  Portion control is key.  Learn the proper portions and what they look like.\n     b.  Lean proteins, whole grains, vegetables and fresh fruit are best.\n     c.  Limit your intake of processed food (eg. white flour, sugar, refined carbohydrates).\n     d.  Drink 6 to 8 glasses of water per day to stay well hydrated.\n     e.  Figure out how many calories are appropriate for you to eat each day.  There are plenty of websites that can help you do this.\n     f.   Eat 4 to 5 smaller meals throughout the day, rather than the standard 3 large meals.\n\n3.  REST:\n     a.  Get at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night.\n     b.  Give yourself at least one day off from exercise per week to let your muscles recover."

Was it not worth recording?","","The bible also says that a few people got a male and female of every animal, put them on a boat and saved them from a flood that lasted 150 days.  The elephants alone would have needed 7.5 tons of food to survive that long.  That is if you only have one type of elephant on board and that is if you were giving them starvation rations of 50 pounds of food per elephant per day.  Also Noah lived to be over 600 years old.

"2","When is Mayuri my cousin going to die?","?","Please ignore the rude remarks of thoughtless people.  I assume that you are Indian and that your cousin is sick.  Just because your cousin is very sick it does not necessarily mean that she will die.  However, sometimes people even very young people have a terminal illness which means that eventually they will die from that illness. There are emotional stages to dying and emotional stages to grief.  You are anticipating Mayuri's death and so you are grieving for her even though she is still alive.  \n\nFive emoptional stages of dying denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance were first described by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, M.D., in her book "" On Death and Dying"".  Here is a powerpoint explanation of those stages:\nhttp://webpages.chhs.niu.edu/miller/280/EPILOGUE/sld001.htm\n(be sure to click on view graphic version.)\nThis URL describes the physical pre-active stage of dying and active stage of dying so that you will know when death is emminent.  http://dying.about.com/cs/caregivers/a/DyingSigns.htm\n\nYou might offer to talk to Mayuri about how she feels.  You might also talk to your parents about how you feel.  It is sometimes very difficult to understand why people die and we may feel helpless in caring for them.  Whatever your beliefs are you should find comfort in spiritual guidance."

Could I have one too????","Apparently its called 'binge-ing' where she eats late at night shes been noticeably underweight the past couple of years.  Is there a chance I have one too?

Im not obese nor skinny- Im about 6'0'' 185-190.  Thanks!!!!!!","Usually when people 'binge eat', they go to the bathroom and vomit the food so that they do not gain weight.  It is not a nice thing.  Perhaps that's why she is 'noticeably underweight' as you say.\n\nYou do not appear to be the same since you simply seem to have a healthy appetite or you love to eat, and plenty, too.  But your weight is normal for your height, and you don't mention any ailments or abnormalities.\n\nYou did not say if she had just one meal per day, only that she ate late at night, so it is a little difficult to determine anything further.\n\nShe does need help. though, and support."

"2","Why do they use salt in the process of making ice cream?","in the process of making ice cream they use salt and ice to freeze it..what does the salt do?","While it lowers the mp of water as stated earlier (a colligative property), more importantly, the dissolving process (measured by heat of solvation) is endothermic.  It takes energy to separate the ions in the salt (solute).  That energy comes from the solvent (water).\n\nTherefore, the solution cools.  (BTW, the salt goes into the cooling or refrigerant bath, not the edible product itself).\n\nIf you start with ice water(0 C), then you end up cooler than zero.  At those temps, the fatty emulsion of protein and water (aka cream) (as well as sugar and flavoring) solidifies.\n\nYum, yum and enjoy."
"2","May I pose a math question?","Point A and Point B are 600 miles apart.  A train leaves Point A travelling toward Point B at 5:30AM at a constant speed of 65 kph.  Another train leaves Point B heading toward Point A at 6:20AM at a constant speed of 40 kph.  What time do the two trains meet?","Ok, first you want to see where they meet. To make this easier, advance train A for 5/6ths of an hour and see the problem in terms of when train B starts out. 65 x 5/6= 325/6\nkilometers. So the problem is the same only they start out at the same time over a distance of 600- 325/6 kilometer =\n545 5/6 kilometers.\n\nNow, they travel in the proportion of 65/105 kilometers per hour. So the distance till they meet will be in the same proportion. That is 545 5/6 x 65/105 = 212875/630 or about 338 kilometers for train A to travel. Since it travels at 65 kph, this means it travels for 5.2 hours from the new start time equal to B's which was 6:20 AM. Ends up being 11:32AM."

What can I do to heal the nail + skin fast?","I did the same and didn't want to go to the doctor and ended up going anyway.... This is what he told me to do..\n\n\n1. Soak it in warm water for about 5 to 10 minutes. (adding something to the water is not necessary)!\n\n2. Dry it really well.\n\n3. Take some Hydrogen Peroxide put some on a Q-tip and apply it to the affected area.\n\n4. Rinse off the peroxide. Dry really well (blow dryer suggested) but not necessary.\n\n5. Next you will need to have some (Betadine) (Povidone Iodine Topical Solution). Take another q-tip dip it in and apply to the toe making sure you cover the whole affected area. \n\n6. Dry with a blow dryer to make sure it is really dry! The only time it should be covered with a band-aid or gauze is if you have your shoes on.. The more air it gets the better..\n\n7. This will have to be done three times a day.\n\nIf you do this it will get better and you shouldn't have to go to the Doc.  This is what i did and it worked!...It will take a while since you waited so long, but it will get better.\nThe nail will have to grow out before you can do anything about it.  When you trim your nails let them stick out a little not too much....This will help.  I know from experience this is no fun so....Good Luck!! :-)\n\nHope this helps you!\n\nIf you do all of this it should go away!\n\nHope this works for you! Hope you feel better!\n\n\nForgot to mention that it was really bad and infected and the doctor told me that if it didn't work i would have to have the toenail removed.  This really worked because i didn't have any surgery at all and the doctor was impressed that it ended up getting better with no surgery!  It was really puffy also.  Again good luck!!"

I just took my last tylenol 3 about 20 min. ago, And it says to take every 4 hours. After the 4 hours is up, can i take the percacet then or should i wait longer?","You have an hour 'window'.  You can take the percocet in 3 hours after taking the tylenol 3.  \nMake sure you aren't allergic to percocet.  \nIf you are in doubt of anything I am telling you, feel free to either call your doc or pharmacist and ask them.  \nMake sure you rinse your mouth with salt water and do it often.  Motrin may help too with any inflammation you have.  You can take both percocet and motrin together if you want.  \nA mouth rinse will help too.  If you have a good rappor with your dentist, you may want to ask for some 'dental wax' to stick in the tooth that is giving you trouble.  It will block any food from getting in there and staying in there.  \nUse anbesol or orajel.  That also helps.\nHope you feel better."

"1","anyone know how to learn how to see ghost or spirits?","","In my opinion it is impossible to teach yourself to see ghosts, you either can or you can't (and I know a couple of people who can, including myself when I was younger, the former owner of my parents house, which he build, doesn't want to leave, and he's a fairly nice old man).  \n\nI will argue that all ghost are not demonic spirits, yes, some are are really, really bad (like the one is my sister's apartment in State College, PA, he stalked my sister's roommate in certain instances, which is how I found out she can see ghosts), but for the most part there is as much a mix of good spirits to malevolent spirits as there are to good people vs. malevolent people. \nNow, you can experience ghosts with out being able to see them.  Before I go any futher I have to say, there is no scientific evidence that either confirms or denies the existence of ghosts, spirits, whatever you want to call them.  Having personal experience with instance that are within keeping of arguements made toward the existence of ghosts (yeah I know that is hard to read, but i can't phrase it much better), I happen to belive in them.  Since ghosts take space they have a subtance, while this substance is generally not visible to the average person, the electromagnatic patterns show up on pictures, including digital cameras.  So, if you think you have a ghost take a bunch of pictures, they will show up as a ball of light, where there is nothing.  However, I wouldn't recommend using a cell phone cam because the resolution of those suck, so distortion for bright lights in the background may interfere with an accurate picture.  See the source for tips to photograph them.\n\nI will agree with the statement that if even if you could learn to see them, you don't want want to.  There is nothing scarier then seeing a pure black spirits (one that is completely evil).  Yes, if you have the ability to see them, most of them are a shade of grey.  The color spectrum is  from pure white (good) to pure black (evil), most of them are a shade of grey, though I never remember seeing a pure white spirit, a couple that were a really light shades of grey, but never white.  Just in case you are wondering, it was around the age of 12-13 that I could no longer see ghosts, though I can stil ""sense"" most spirits."

So, this is really (3^9)^1/4,\nor the 4th root of 3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3\nThe 4th root of 3*3*3*3 is obviously 3, and you have this twice under the square root symbol. That means you need this squared.

"1","Christianity is a terror religion. do you agree?","the history tells us that those are and were christians have been made 99% of the masacare and wars in the world. is it true that christianity makes its believers as terrorists?.","Ibn Warraq put it, ""Historically speaking, Monotheism has often shown itself to be ferociously intolerant, in contrast to polytheism on behalf of which religious wars have never been waged.""\n\n“Christians see it as their duty to save the soul of the non-believer, who is seen as inferior. Such religions are inherently predatory and destructive of the cultural systems that they encounter in their role as the aggressor.”\n\n\nChristian churches have formed terrorist organisation in non christian countries. In north east India they have been using all methods for conversion including conversions at gun point. In some states they have literally banned practising hinduism in last four years. 20 hindus were killed only in 2001 for not converting.\n\nOnce they get considerable number of converts they turn more aggressive and resort to more violent tactics, They have been trying to break india and make a separate christian nation now. Thats the fruit we got for being tolerant and giving them freedom to practice their religion.

"1","Are we ALL capable of murder?","What do you think drives the most apparently 'sane' people to murder?\nWhat would drive you?\nIs it a tragic human flaw that causes us to kill each other for sport, revenge, fury, love and NOT the basic animal instincts of hunger and protection; or the belief that we are more superior than others?","Forget about the whole ""we're so much better than animals"" thing. Our animal instincts still affect us, even though it's not apparent. The ""fight and flight"" instinct is still prominent in our systems.\n\nSo when man murders outside of ""he'll kill me first"" then it's a mental thing that they are willing to do. Does that mean that we're all capable outside of that, sure. We just decide that a person's life isn't as important as ours (which is what hunters have when they hunt, no hunter things of the animal as an equal).

"2","can someone tell me the name of a 2300 year old manuscript that contains secrets to romance, finance,success,?","nouveau tech","""Kamasutram, generally known to the Western world as Kama Sutra, is an ancient Indian text on human sexual behavior, widely considered to be the standard work on love in Sanskrit literature. The text was composed by Vatsyayana, as a brief summary of various earlier works belonging to a tradition known generically as Kama Shastra, the science of love. Kama is literally desire. Sutra signfies a thread, or discourse threaded on a series of aphorisms. Sutra was a standard term for a technical text, thus also the Yogasutram of Patanjali. The text is originally known as Vatsyayana Kamasutram (""Vatsyayana's Aphorisms on Love""). Tradition holds that the author was a celibate scholar. He is believed to have lived sometime between the 1st to 6th centuries AD, probably during the great cultural flowering of the Gupta period."""

In a rural area in the country where there are people and more birds or in a city where there are more people and less birds? 10 points to the best answer.","This is a bit of a tricky question. The bird flu virus is evolving and will continue to change through genetic mutations. Right now, the virus appears in two varieties. One that can spread from bird-to-bird and another that spreads from birds-to-humans. The virus has still not evolved to spread from humans-to-humans.The last transformation can be catastrophic, if it isn't (somehow) contained. \n\nIf it can spread from human-to-human, the virus will be more lethal in urban settings. \nHowever, if it can only spread from birds-to-humans, it will spread faster in rural settings, where humans are in closer contact with birds. \n\nOf course, this is assuming that there aren't as many poultry farms in cities  (which might not necessarily be true for all countries)."

"2","what is the difference between mummification and freezing?","","I agree w/ eggman.\n\nMummification has to do w/ drying out as a means of preservation. But it doesn't always have to be dried out. Sometimes it is done as a form of burial which is a good method of isolation from the reaches of bacteria when done in the right setting. The bog bodies of Great Britain & other parts of Europe are a great example.\n\nThe 'bog bodies' are awesome specimens of mummification. If you haven't seen them then you should Google it. Their bodies were preserved well, some with the hair & wardrobe still intact. That is pretty neat considering some, but not all, of these bodies are from the Bronze Age.\n\nI love to PowerPoint pictures of them & show my students. The gross factor is wonderful!\n\nFreezing as a form of preservation can be both good & bad. Think of it as putting a steak in a freezer bag, putting it in the freezer, & leaving it for 20 years. It still may resemble the steak but won't taste all that good nor look that good. So it preserves pretty well as a whole but, like eggman said, not at the cellular level.\n\nFunny story about Wooly Mammoths being preserved though freezing...There is more than one version of the story but I like this one better it makes more sense...Also, this may just be one of those geologist myths...(as told by my prof & read in magazines)\n\nWhen the first mammoth was discovered, scientists had a ""cookout"" w/ the meat that was around 10,000 years old.\n\nOn a dare to each other they decided to cook & eat the meat. Problem is w/ 10,000 year old mammoth meat you don't know how many times the freezer ""went down"", if you know what I mean!\n\nWell supposedly the meat partially rotted either before it completely froze or sometime later during a thaw. It had started to decomp. It made them sick.\n\nMoral of the story...don't eat meat that is older than you or that you weren't old enough to remember seeing put into the freezer.\n\nI love to gross my students out w/ that story when I am passing my sample of mammoth hair around the room.\n\n:)"
"1","Would you listen to them?","I honestly can't believe the things I am hearing from Jehovah's Witnesses. I've been talking to them and find them humble and eager to teach. I was raised a Catholic, have studied many different religions, but none of them compare to Jehovah's Witnesses. I have always found all religions to be hypocritical in some way, but not with the JWs (and trust me, I've been trying to find something wrong w/ them). Every single one of their teachings they back up with the scriptures- it's even kinda annoying! lol. I don't know what made me open my door up to them that day, but I did. Anyways, my question is would u listen to them? Give them a chance? If not, why not?","These facts about Jehovah's Witnesses are perhaps relevant to this question. The more one compares this Christian religion with others, the more remarkable it is shown to be.\n\n1. Jehovah's Witnesses have no paid clergy. Yet they remain tightly organized with more than 6.5 million active Jehovah's Witness preachers (about 16 million associate themselves with the religion). Even fulltime preachers and workers at their branch offices are unpaid volunteers.\n\n2. There is no elite class among Jehovah's Witnesses. Even the few 'anointed' among them enjoy no special privileges in their congregations on earth. An anointed person (one of those relative few with a heavenly hope) is not elevated above his fellow congregants in any way, and he may not even qualify for appointment as a simple 'deacon' or elder. There are no titles; EVERYONE is addressed as 'brother' or 'sister'.\n\n3. No person benefits economically from the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Even the 8 to 20 men who serve on their Governing Body receive simply room, board, medical care, and reimbursement for certain personal expenses according to the exact same provision as every other branch volunteer.\n\n4. About a hundred men have served on Jehovah's Witnesses' Governing Body committee during the past 125 years or so. The vast majority of them have spent the vast majority of their adult lives volunteering for their organization's purposes, and the vast majority have died faithfully and near-pennilessly while still under their legal 'vow of poverty'.\n\n5. Amazingly, Jehovah's Witnesses did not splinter as a sect from some other religion. Instead, a truly tiny but sincere group of bible students studied only the Scriptures to determine the will of God. Thus their religion remains absolutely independent of and not carrying the sins of Christendom's history, yet carries the authority of Christ's teachings.\n\n6. Despite the distortions of anti-Witnesses, throughout their modern history Jehovah's Witnesses have refused to claim divine inspiration or infallibility for their teachings. They have pointed to the bible (and not any particular translation) as the only inspired infallible means of knowing God's thoughts. For over 125 years, their teachings have been presented as merely the results of sincere bible research by imperfect but godly humans.\n\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/jt/article_07.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20040601/article_02.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/people/who.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/people/statistics.htm"

"1","What's Behind 666?","","33 The wild beast has a name, and this name is a number: 666. Six, as a number, is associated with Jehovah’s enemies.  A Philistine man of the Rephaim was of “extraordinary size,” and his “fingers and toes were in sixes.” (1 Chronicles 20:6) King Nebuchadnezzar erected a golden image 6 cubits in breadth and 60 cubits high, to unify his political officials in one worship. When God’s servants refused to worship the image of gold, the king had them thrown into a fiery furnace. (Daniel 3:1-23) The number six falls short of seven, which stands for completeness from God’s standpoint. Therefore, a triple six represents gross imperfection.\n\n     34 A name identifies a person.  So how does this number identify the beast?  John says that it “is a man’s number,” not that of a spirit person, so the name helps to confirm that the wild beast is earthly, symbolizing human government. Just as six fails to measure up to seven, so 666—six to the third degree—is a fitting name for the world’s gigantic political system that fails so miserably to measure up to God’s standard of perfection. The world’s political wild beast rules supreme under the name-number 666, while big politics, big religion, and big business keep that wild beast functioning as an oppressor of mankind and a persecutor of God’s people.\n\n35 What does it mean to be marked on the forehead or in the right hand with the name of the wild beast? When Jehovah gave Israel the Law, he told them:  “You must apply these words of mine to your heart and your soul and bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they must serve as a frontlet band between your eyes.” (Deuteronomy 11:18)  This meant that the Israelites had to keep that Law constantly before them, so that it influenced all their actions and thoughts.  In imitation, Satan uses the demonic mark of the wild beast.   Anybody engaged in everyday activities such as buying and selling is pressured to do things the way the wild beast does, as, for example, in celebrating holidays.  They are expected to worship the wild beast, letting it rule their lives, so as to receive its mark.\n\n38 Yes, the world is a difficult place for those who do not have the mark of the wild beast.  It is an outstanding demonstration of Jehovah’s power and blessing that the remaining ones of the seed of the woman, as well as more than three million of the great crowd, are keeping integrity despite all the pressures to break God’s laws.  (Revelation 7:9)  Unitedly, throughout the earth, may all of us continue to magnify Jehovah and his righteous ways, as we refuse to receive the mark of the wild beast.—Psalm 34:1-3.\n\n    If you would like further information or a free home Bible study, please contact Jehovah's Witnesses at the local Kingdom Hall.

"3","What is the best natural way to keep your bones and cartilage healthy?","Any awesome feedback is great.  I am into natural health and organic eating.  Thank you.","As noted from others, exercise and proper calcium levels are a must.  Dairy is not the best source of calcium: the best are kale, collards, spinach and calcium-fortified soymilk.  The best way to get proper levels of calcium and the vitamins and minerals that go along with bone building is with proper digestion.  If you have a history of indigestion/heartburn, and especially if you take antacids or acid decreasing drugs, you must get digestion working properly.  This includes proper levels of acid in the stomach.  This is necessary for calcium absorption.  Look for a company named Standard Process.  They can direct you to a doctor who can help with digestion.  If you are female, proper balancing of hormones is vital as well.  Get checked out by a doctor who uses natural-based medicine.

There, he was the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy for 16 years.  He is well-known in his field.  He is the author or editor of 22 textbooks and has published over 181 scientific papers.  In 1991, he received the most distinguished award presented in the field of anatomy in Canada, the J.C.B. Grant Award from the Canadian Association of Anatomists.  When he was asked about the scientific miracles in the Quran which he has researched, he stated the following: \n\n“The way it was explained to me is that Muhammad was a very ordinary man.  He could not read, didn’t know [how] to write. In fact, he was an illiterate.  And we’re talking about twelve [actually about fourteen] hundred years ago.  You have someone illiterate making profound pronouncements and statements and that are amazingly accurate about scientific nature.  And I personally can’t see how this could be a mere chance.  There are too many accuracies and, like Dr. Moore, I have no difficulty in my mind that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led him to these statements.”  (View the RealPlayer video of this comment ) \n\nProfessor Persaud has included some Quranic verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  in some of his books.  He has also presented these verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  at several conferences. \n\n2)  Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson is the Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.  Formerly, he was Professor of Ob-Gyn and the Chairman of the Department of Ob-Gyn at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  He was also the President of the American Fertility Society.  He has received many awards, including the Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology Public Recognition Award in 1992.  Professor Simpson studied the following two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad : \n\n{In every one of you, all components of your creation are collected together in your mother’s womb by forty days...}2 \n\n{If forty-two nights have passed over the embryo, God sends an angel to it, who shapes it and creates its hearing, vision, skin, flesh, and bones....}3 \n\nHe studied these two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad  extensively, noting that the first forty days constitute a clearly distinguishable stage of embryo-genesis.  He was particularly impressed by the absolute precision and accuracy of those sayings of the Prophet Muhammad .  Then, during one conference, he gave the following opinion: \n\n“So that the two hadeeths (the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad ) that have been noted provide us with a specific time table for the main embryological development before forty days.  Again, the point has been made, I think, repeatedly by other speakers this morning: these hadeeths could not have been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge that was available [at] the time of their writing . . . . It follows, I think, that not only there is no conflict between genetics and religion but, in fact, religion can guide science by adding revelation to some of the traditional scienti"

It did not matter what pill I was on and a lot of doctors couldn't help me, they just kept prescribing different methods of contraception.\n\nI tried Spirulina (vitamins made from Seaweed) for stress purposes and that seemed to help a bit.\n\nEventually I found a very knowledgeable lady.  Apparently (and I kbow it sounds far-fetched but its true) during certain times of the month, women retain water and the pill exacerbates this.  With the extra water, there is more pressure on the brain which sends mixed messages to it causing the emotional rollercoaster you're on.  She prescibed very mild water-tablets for me.  It helped a lot.  The reason the Spirulina seemed to work was because its also a diuretic to some extent.  However, for me it never cleared up completely so I also took Vitamin B6.\n\nNow I'm off the pill and I don't seem to be suffering like I used to."

"3","i just want to know how abscess happen,its relating to skin or blood tkx?","","Generally the skin is constantly irritated in the same spot, such as a bedsore. If the pressure is removed from that spot, this allows fresh blood to enter the area & prevent skin breakdown. Otherwise it turns into an abcess.\nPeople who are bedridden tend to get them. By rotating the person every few hours or changing their position...& keeping an eye out for pink spots on the skin & gently rubbing some lotion into those spots should help prevent the abcess from forming."

"2","Why when a helicopter hovers the Earth doesnt move out from under it as the planet rotates?","","The helicopter is moving with the Earth (and air, ...) as the Earth rotates on its axis.  Just because the helicopter is no longer physically connected with the Earth does not mean that it longer moves with the Earth since its momentum is conserved.\nIts momentum while still located on the surface of the spinning Earth was some initial value.  When the Helicopter lifts up off the ground, by the law of conservation of momentum, it still has that same value.  However, if you want to be very technical, now that it is at a farther distance away from the center of the Earth, it is traveling just a wee bit slower than it should be in order to stay perfectly above its original position on the ground.  However, this difference in its speed of so small, it is easily negligible and is soon overcome by frictional forces."

"2","Do you believe in science??? If yes, to what extent? and why??If not why???","And another qustion which goes like this:\nThe sun is burning since billions of yrs. It has released tremendous amount of energy since then.According to Einstein,energy release is the result of mass lost. That means sun is continuously losing its mass since billions of yrs. According to Newton F= m1.m2/ d.d\n  Here the mass of the sun i.e. m2 is decreasing.And ultimately the value of F will be decreased. But still the sun is attracting the heavenly bodies with the same force..The earth and other planets have not yet left their orbits. How is this possible????How is it still balanced?????","That's not a valid question. Belief in Science is not required, because Science has and requires evidence to back up all it's claims. It's like opening a book on the plays of Shakespeare and saying you believe that the little symbols you see in the book form words. If the book could feel emotions it would not care whethor you believed there were words inside it or not, because your belief or your disbelief has no effect either way.\n\nThe closest you can say is whethor or not you agree with the conclusions the scientific community has derived from the evidence.\n\nAs for why we're still attracted to the sun, yes you are correct in that there is mass lost with the hydrogen nuclear reactions taking place, but the mass the sun loses is very small in comparison to the mass of the sun."

"1","why is it bad for to people of the same gender to get married even if they love each other ?","","It is not really a human question.  By whose standards are you living?  People will condemn you for everthing you do that is not the same as them.  If you are poor, fat, gay, stay at home mom, working mom, in private school, in public school...etc.  People are not what 'should' matter.  It is between you, and the person you get involved with.\n\nIf you beleive in God, then that is another matter and it is also completely your own business.  If you DO believe in God though....you'll have to be honest with yourself and take the matter to HIM alone in prayer.\n\nPeople need to mind their business about someone's private life - and if they are 'Chrisitians"" they cannot judge you -they can only look at themselves - and improve or make their own changes within.  \n\nLegalization would really depend on the religious influence of the country.  You cannot expect basic bible principles to change for your convenience. No need to be bitter - religion is not necessarily a bad thing, it is just not that convenient - for anybody who devoutly tries to follow it.  \n\nNot just gays. Nobody wants to feel discriminated against. It is not a good thing to have to live with. However gays have gained a lot - perhaps some feel that it has been at 'their' expense.

"2","genotypic and phenotypic ratios?","what is it","A genotype is the actual genetic code of an organism, the sequence of the base pairs on the DNA. The phenotype is what those genes actually express, what you would see if you looked at the organism.\n\nSay there's a gene that controls the color of a mouse's fur. We'll call the dominant form of the gene which gives brown fur, B. The recessive form, for white fur, will be b.\n\nA mouse gets one copy of the gene (called an allele) from each parent, for a total of two. That means there are three combinations of alleles: BB, bb, and Bb. A mouse with two recessive alleles will be white, and a mouse with two dominant alleles will be brown. A heterozygous mouse (with one dominant and one recessive copy) will also be brown.\n\nGenotype          Phenotype\nbb                White\nBB                Brown\nBb                Brown\n\nSo even though the BB and Bb mice have different genotypes, they have the same phenotype.\n\nIn the example above, the phenotypic ratio would reflect the amount of mice of a different color in a population. For example, if you crossed two heterozygous mice, the brown to white ratio of the offspring would be 3:1. The genotypic ratio, reflecting the genetic code of the offspring (BB to Bb to bb), would be 1:2:1."

"2","What is a protozoan?","","Protozoans are the unicellular heterotrophs of the kingdom Protista . Protozoans comprise a large, diverse assortment of microscopic or near-microscopic organisms that live as single cells or in simple colonies and that show no differentiation into tissues. Formerly classified in the animal kingdom, they are now generally divided into five protist phyla: Mastigophora (the flagellates), Sarcodina (the amebas), Ciliophora (the ciliates), Opalinida , and Sporozoa . Most are mobile, and most ingest food, as do animals, rather than produce it themselves, as do plants. The 26,000 living species are cosmopolitan in distribution; they are found in freshwater and at all depths in the ocean; some live in soil. Some are parasites in the bodies of humans or other animals, sometimes causing diseases. \n\nHOW THEY EAT\nSome protozoans have complex digestive systems and feed on large food particles, such as other microorganisms. The food is digested by means of enzymes and the wastes transported to the cell surface or stored in vacuoles (bubble like spaces in the cytoplasm). Others have no digestive system and absorb dissolved organic matter through the cell membrane. \n\nBREATHING\nRespiration is accomplished by the diffusion of dissolved gases through the cell membrane. Oxygen diffuses into the cell, where it oxidizes food molecules, producing energy and the organic molecules used for the building and maintenance of the cell. Carbon dioxide and water, the waste products of this oxidation, diffuse out of the cell."

"3","whats the easiest way to pack on muscle without taking supplements or steroids?","","While there are no 'easy' ways there are effective ways.\n\nMuscles need exercise, rest and nutrition in the right proportion in order to grow stronger.  \n\nResistance training actually breaks down the muscle fibers and rest with the proper supply of nutrients will make the muscles grow stronger.  A general rule of thumb is to give your arms one day rest, heavy leg training two days rest with abs and aerobics six days a week.\n\nThe reason that steroids and other supplements make your muscles grow faster is that they decrease this recovery time allowing you to train more.  However the supporting structures (ligaments and tendons) don't grow as fast and are often torn from this imbalance making life miserable and training impossible.\n\nThere are also other hormonal and emotional side-effects from taking steroids including decreased sperm production.  You are wise in avoiding that.  \n\nA good balanced diet is all that is needed.  Most North American and Western diets have plenty of protein but too much fat and not enough fruits and vegetables.  With enough protein I would focus on getting lots of fruits and vegetables because the vitamins and minerals will help all your body functions including building muscle."

Practice sensing energy. Once you can do that, you can tell what's coming at you, and from where. My motto in this instance is ""do unto others what they have done unto you.""\n\nyou may wish to put wards up around your house. These are magical protections that will sort of act as bouncers for any unwanted visitors or intrusive magics. Not sure how? Start with statues of gargoyles or fu dogs. \n\nThe book Psychic Self Defense by Dion Fortune may prove helpful. Most of the good books on magic in general were written in the late eighteen hundreds or early nineteen hundreds. Check them out. \n\nUntil you get your bearings, don't get into any magical fights. The good news is, almost nobody is very competent at the darker magics these days. Even if someone IS casting spells at you, the likelihood of them accomplishing anything is pretty slim."

"3","Memory loss?","Sometimes I experience short term memory loss, not really severe but things like not being able to remember more than 3 things at a time.

I still remember simplistic things (like get the mail or go fix the car tomorrow).  I am under stress sometimes, could this be the cause?  Also, do memory pills (herbal supplements) really work? I'm 38 years old.","It looks like a key course for your problem is stress. Normally people do get mild to moderate forgetfulness as they grow older, but this is unusual for a 38 years old person. My advice to you would be to figure out the actual cause of your stress, and face it. If it means consulting a psychologist, go for it, don't be ashamed, your life is the most important thing. You can seek counselling from the health counsellors as well. Stress affects a human mind in many ways. It decreases concentration span. It keeps a person's mind pre-occupied, thus preventing it from registering spoken information. It causes headaches and interferes with a person's normal daily living. If it is not treated earlier it advances to a stage where forgetfulness is moderate to severe. At that stage it might be difficult for you to even remember the sources of help. So it would be safer for you to treat it now rather than waiting for a stage where you won't even remember that you've got a problem. A priest is one of the best counsellors. Praying is the best option. Good luck."

This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit. Stop making some major mistakes wake up earlier and get active earlier your metabolism is sluggish and needs to be woken up this is half your problem. \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - multigrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone."

Instead it focuses on why smokers continue to smoke in spite of the obvious disadvantages.\n\nIt is fear that keeps smokers hooked!\n\nFear the smoker will have to give up their pleasure or crutch. Fear the smoker will be unable to enjoy life or handle stress. Fear the smoker will have to go through an awful trauma to get free. Fear the smoker will never get completely free from the craving.\n\nThe Method removes these fears\nSmokers quit with the Allen Carr Method as happy non-smokers, not feeling deprived but with a huge sense of relief and elation that they have finally achieved what they always wanted….\n\nTO BE FREE!\n\nWhat about the terrible withdrawal pangs from nicotine?\n\nThe physical withdrawal from nicotine is so slight that most smokers don’t realise that they are addicts. What smokers suffer when they try and quit using other methods is the misery and depression caused by the belief that they are being deprived of a pleasure or a crutch.\n\nThe Allen Carr Method removes this feeling of deprivation.\nIt removes the need and desire to smoke. Once the smoker is in the right frame of mind and they follow the simple instructions, the physical withdrawal from nicotine is hardly noticeable.\n\nNo Gimmicks!\n\nThe Method does not use any gimmicks, useless aids or substitutes. No nicotine gum, patches, lozenges, tabs, inhilators or nasal sprays! No needles! No lasers! No drugs! No herbs! No shock treatment!\n\nThe Allen Carr Method is successful because:\n\nIt removes the smokers’ conflict of will.\nThere are no bad withdrawal pangs.\nIt is instantaneous and easy.\nIt is equally effective for long-term heavy smokers and light smokers.\nYou need not gain weight.\nYou will not miss smoking.\n\nMedical Endorsements\n\nA personal view from Professor Judith Mackay MBE, JP, FRCO (Edin), FRCP (Lon), World Health Organisation Advisory Panel on Tobacco and Health\n\n“I have no hesitation in supporting Allen Carr’s work. Many clinics use some of his techniques but it would appear that few do it in quite such a successful package.”\n\nCarole Johnson, Coronary Heart Disease Prevention Unit, Tyne Tees\n\n“his success rate was such that, when budgets allow, we continue to use Easyway for work with specific groups and individuals.”\n\nDr Anil Visa BSc, MBBch., FRCA, Consultant – Royal Hospitals NHS Trust – Royal London Hospital\n\n“I have observed the Allen Carr method at first hand and have found it to be very successful and I wholeheartedly support it as an effective way to quit smoking.”\n\nDr William Green, Head of Psychiatric Dept, Matilda Hospital, Hong Kong\n\n“It is a remarkable fact that Allen Carr, on his own admission a non-professional in behaviour modification, should have succeeded where countless psychologists and psychiatrists holding postgraduate qualifications have failed, in formulating a simple and effective way to stop smoking.”\n\nDr Martin Jarvis, Principle Scientist, Imperial Cancer Research\nFund and Reader in Health Psychology, University College London\n\n”...I am more than happy to testify to Allen Carr’s enduring involvement and to recognise the value of the kind of behavioural and cognitive support he provides.”\n\nDr PM Bray MB CH.b., MRCGP\n\n“I "

"3","is erythema modusom contagious?and what causes it?","","You mean:\n \n \nErythema Nodosum\nWhat is erythema nodosum?\nErythema nodosum is characterized by tender, red bumps, usually found on the shins. Quite often, erythema nodosum is not a separate disease, but, rather, a sign of some other disease, or of a sensitivity to a drug.\n\nDiseases that can cause erythema nodosum: \n\nstreptococcal infections \nsarcoidosis (inflammation of the lymph nodes and other organs) \nleprosy \ncoccidioidomycosis (infection of the upper respiratory tract and lungs) \nhistoplasmosis (an infectious pulmonary disease) \ntuberculosis \npsittacosis (a flu-like disease) \nlymphogranuloma venereum (a venereal infection) \nulcerative colitis \nDrugs that can cause erythema nodosum: \n\nantibiotics containing sulfa \nbromides \nidodides \noral contraceptives \nWhat are the symptoms of erythema nodosum?\nThe following are the most common symptoms of erythema nodosum. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently: \n\nraised bruises on shins \nfever \njoint pain \nenlarged lymph nodes in chest \nYoung adults are particularly susceptible to erythema nodosum -- the symptoms ofÂ which may resemble other dermatologic conditions. Consult a physician for diagnosis.\n\nHow is erythema nodosum diagnosed?\nA biopsy (removal of tissue for examination under a microscope) of a bump can usually confirm the diagnosis. However, the exact cause can not always be identified. Drug-caused erythema nodosum can usually be diagnosed by careful elimination of the drug causing it.\n\nTreatment for erythema nodosum:\nSpecific treatment for erythema nodosum will be determined by your physician based on the cause of the disorder and may include: \n\nantibiotics \ntreatment of underlying cause \nbed rest to relieve pain \naspirin \ncorticosteroids"

"3","Is being an anesthesiologist pyhsical or mental work? How so if one?","","The anesthesiologist’s role is the practice of medicine dedicated to the relief of pain and total care of the surgical patient before, during, and after surgery. Anesthesiologists are fully trained physicians. After completing a four-year college program and four years of medical school, anesthesiologists undergo four additional years of specialized residency training. Some will spend one to two more years training in such anesthesiology subspecialty areas as obstetrics, neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, pediatrics, or critically ill patients, or to learn more about the treatment of pain. Others may select to work in research laboratories, investigating, for example, how anesthetics work and how they influence disease or recovery.\nThe anesthesiologist is also involved in postoperative pain management, prescribing the appropriate painrelieving medication and therapies.\nThe anesthesiologist also prescribes individualized drug therapies to patients suffering from acute, chronic, and cancer pain.\nDuring childbirth, the anesthesiologist must provide pain relief with epidural or spinal blocks for the mother while managing the life functions of both the mother and the baby.\nIn critical care and trauma medicine, the anesthesiologist makes immediate diagnoses while supporting respiratory and cardiovascular functions, controlling infection, providing airway management, cardiac and pulmonary resuscitation, advanced life support, and pain control.\nThe anesthesiologist is also present during cardiac catheterizations, angioplasties, radiological imaging, gastrointestinal endoscopies, in vitro fertilization, electroshock therapy, and respiratory therapy.\nThe anesthesiologist participates in research and clinical studies, as well as medical education programs and legislative activities."
"2","Would the size of a lens effect the magnification produced by the lens?","Would the magnification of a lens reduced in size increase or decrease the magnification produced by the lens. What relation would this have to the focal length because reducing the size would reduce the focal length. Would s and s' change with proportional to produce no change in magnification.","for the size of the lens i would go back to the lens maker formula it is:\npower of lens = (n(lens) - n(0)) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\nwhere n(lens) is refractive index of lens material\nn(0) is refractive index of the medium in which lens is kept\nR1 and R2 are surface radius of the two sides of the lens.\nso you can see from the equation to increase power of the lens we can either increase refractive index of the lens (assuming we are seeing it in air) or reduce the radius of curvature of the lens sides. so ideally as power increses the radius of the lens decreases and so the size of the lens also reduces. you can also check out gullstrands equation for further reference of thicker lenses. hope this helps"
"1","What do you think of homeless people?","I was at the bookstore today and there was a man there that I would assume was homeless by his appearance and extreme body odor. I left immediately because the odor was too much to take. What do you guys think? Do we have a right to feel offended by others who aren't really bothering us but just living their lives? Do you complain when the homeless occupy the same stores you do and think they should not be let to do so? Or do you feel compassion and just ignore them.","I try to get beyond my initial reactions of fear or disgust. I remind myself that these people need compassion and understanding. I realize that I can't know all there is to know about them in one encounter and that the homeless are not one homogenous group. There are a variety of reasons for their status. \n\nI would not complain that they should leave a store, library, train or whatever. I hope I challenge myself to question my assumptions and become more giving to them. Sometimes I do give them money or a transit card or something to eat. (Once I offered a doggie bag with pizza in it to a homeless woman and was puzzled that she rejected it because she didn't like the flavor. It's hard not to judge, but by forcing myself to see that she needs dignity and can decide if she can decline an offer of food so be it.)\n\nLet these encounters help you become a better person."
"2","how do people determin where a galaxy ends?","are they like states, something u can't actually see or is there something distinctive that shows where they end?","This is actually not as easy as it looks. If you look at a picture of a galaxy, it is usually pretty clear where the stars stop and that is usually regarded as the edge of the galaxy. The problem is that all galaxies have a 'halo' of gas with a few stars and this halo can extend quite a bit further out than the stars themselves do. Sometimes this gas is very hot and emits X-rays or gamma rays, which is one way we detect it. Even worse is the fact that most galaxies are in clusters where the halos actually merge to a great extent. Finally, there is also a 'dark matter' halo around all galaxies that has its own distribution that may be different than that of the gas halo.\n\nIn practice, the edge is usually defined by where the visible stars stop, but an awareness has to be kept of these other issues and heir effects on the motions of the stars themselves."

I find that hard to believe, because one the middle east doesn't have that kind of technology, or at least I don't thik so. SO all I want too know is do humans really have that kind of technology?","No, I don't think so, but that doesn't mean that someone isn't trying. That guy in Idaho is pretty wacko, but I have heard of a few things that OUR government/military have been doing in Alaska.  I've read and heard a few things about using microwave beams of natural radiation (basically microwaves directed at cloud formations and the Ionisphere) that change the winds in the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere, change some cloud formations, I believe by disapation, with the high concentration of the microwave energy (and it requires a huge amount of energy to power this beam, and also I don't know what the power source would be, but still it would require a ton of energy, to run this device, like having it's own power plant type of #'s), and the one other point is that the area that is effected by this microwave beam is very small and regionalized, probably just a few 10's of feet.  I've read a few things on the net, and of course there are conspiracy theories and all, but the US Govt have been interested in weather modification for a long time to use as a weapon of war, to help weaken the enemy, so it wouldn't surprise me to think that some form of this has got to be true. The person who controls the weather, will eventually rule the world, pretty heavy stuff, I know. So we may have some of the technology to do this, but it's on a very small scale. The guy from Idaho is crazy, but at the same time he is making alot of money off of this crap, with his internet sites and radio appearances. This guy used to be a tv weatherman, but then saw the dollar signs to do this, instead. Hmmm..., maybe I should do this?"

"2","Can a man be considered to be heterozygous, if so please give an example!?","","When Mendel began to scientifically analyze ""heredity"", he concluded that each parent (mother + father) donates an ""allele"" for a characteristic (trait) in question.\n\nA lettering system was used: Capital letters indicated that the allele is DOMINANT; lower-case letters indicate that the allele is RECESSIVE.  This is the case for 22 of the 23 chromosome pairs in humans.  The 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes.  Females (mother) always donate an ""X"" allele; fathers can donate either an ""X"" or a ""Y"" allele.\n\nIf a person's genotype for their sex is ""XX"", this means two things.  1: Both X's are the same (in other words, X and X are identical).  Identical alleles are called HOMOZYGOUS.  2: A human who is ""XX"" is female.\n\nA human who is ""XY"" is male.  ""X"" allele and ""Y"" allele are DIFFERENT.  Thus, they called HETEROZYGOUS.  We refer to men as being ""heterozygous"" in that a male's SEX alleles, 'X' and 'Y' are different.\n\nLet us say ""B"" is the dominant allele for brown eyes, and ""b"" is the recessive allele that can result in blue eyes.  A person who is ""Bb"" is heterozygous (B is a different allele than b).  A person's who genotype is Bb is likely to have brown eyes.  A person who is ""BB"" is HOMOZYGOUS (1st B is identical to the 2nd B) and will definitely have brown eyes.  A person who is ""bb"" is HOMOZYGOUS (1st allele 'b' is identical to the 2nd allele, 'b') for the recessive allele; this person will have blue eyes."

"3","GIRLS: what are some signs of NORMAL discharges for women?","down there","Vaginal discharge is normal and varies during your menstrual cycle. Before ovulation (the release of the egg), there is A LOT of mucous produced, up to 30X more than after ovulation. It is also more watery and elastic during that phase of your cycle. You may want to wear panty liners during that time. \n\nThe things to be worried about include if the discharge has a yellow or green color, is clumpy like cottage cheese, or has a bad odor. If worried, see a doctor.\n \n Different Types of Discharge \n\n \n\nWhite: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.\n\nClear and stretchy: This is ""fertile"" mucous and means you are ovulating.\n\nClear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.\n\nYellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.\n\nBrown: May happen right after periods, and is just ""cleaning out"" your vagina. Old blood looks brown.\n\nSpotting Blood/Brown Discharge: This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Sometimes early in pregnancy you may have spotting or a brownish discharge at the time your period would normally come. If you have spotting at the time of your normal period rather than your usual amount of flow, and you have had sex without using birth control, you should check a pregnancy test \n..How old are you (really)? \nAre you on medications or do you take herbs or vitamins?\n\nDo you have pain or itching?\n\nAre you pregnant?\n\nDo you have other health problems (like diabetes)?\nSometimes it isn't accurate to simply say yes or no. Symptoms can depend on the number of sexual partners, kind of sexual partners, birth control, birth control failure, kind of sex you are having and if abuse is involved. I think you can see, it can get pretty complicated to get all the information needed to give the best answer possible.\n\nWith that said, here is my best answer to the common question of vaginal discharge.\nA normal vaginal discharge consists of about a teaspoon (4 ML) a day that is white or transparent, thick to thin, and odorless. This is formed by the normal bacteria and fluids the vaginal cells put off. The discharge can be more noticeable at different times of the month depending on ovulation, menstrual flow, sexual activity and birth control.\n\nIt is not uncommon for the normal discharge to be dark, brown or discolored a day or two following the menstrual period. \nIf you are having ANY of the symptoms below SEE YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.\nPain\n\nItching\n\nDiscomfort\n\nRash or sores alone or with a vaginal discharge"

"1","I have always been troubled by the adage ""just be yourself"". How does one freely just be? does anyone, really?","","I'm taking an Acting for Animators class where we do improv games. The point is to say the first thing in your mind. So that is the natural you, where you can be most creative; when you express yourself as your truest nature.\n\nOften in social situations we may think something and not say it because Person X is present, or they may think I'm weird, or I'm not comfortable doing/saying that in public, or whatever.\n\nAnd often we change how we respond to people based on not what they want, but our PERCEPTION of what they want. So we are faking ourselves to even us.\n\nWhat is true chemistry between people? When they are both themselves and extremely comfortable.\n\nBut changing how you act in front of different people is not a bad thing - everyone does it to different degrees. The problem is when it bothers YOU that you can't ""open up."" If that's the case, then it's better to just be yourself and not worry about what others think...obviously don't say things to offend people or be rude. But beyond that, anything goes. I am me, and the world's gonna know who I am.\n\n\nWhen you open yourself up, you'll get some people who like you, and some people that don't. But this depends less on what you actually say and do. It depends more on how you actually feel about yourself. The best bet is to be yourself AND like yourself!"

However, some people have the Photic Sneeze Reflex.  They do sneeze in bright  light.  \n\nThe most prominent theory, from Wikipedia - Photic Sneeze Reflex - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_sneeze_reflex  is\n""The probable cause is a congenital malfunction in nerve signals in the trigeminal nerve nucleus. The fifth cranial nerve, called the trigeminal nerve, is apparently responsible for sneezes. Research suggests that some people have an association between this nerve and the nerve that transmits visual impulses to the brain. Overstimulation of the optic nerve triggers the trigeminal nerve, and this causes the photic sneeze reflex.""\n\n----\nSee also OMIM - ACHOO: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_Inheritance_in_Man"

The quantity of heat in 0 degrees C is 273 degrees K, so technically you could say tomorrow will be 136.5 degrees K tomorrow (I sure hope not since that is -136.5 degrees C or -213.7 degrees F).\n\nThe issue is the scale.  Think about the case of 0 degrees C which equals 32 degrees F.  In Farenheit, you'd say the answer is 16 degrees, but in Celsius you'd say 0.  But that's two different answers depending on the scale.  If I were to create my own scale, you could make the answer anything.\n\nSo the real answer is you can't answer this question."

"3","What's the right age to start using birth control? Does a doctor prescribe it? is it bad for you???","","If you are talking about taking birth control pills yes a doctor has to prescribe it. First you have to go to a gynecologist who will give you a pelvic exam (not fun) and a pap smear (they scrape inside you with like a popsicle stick) and after he looks at your period history and such he will prescribe a pill that is hormonally balanced for you. The pill can be bad for you especially if you also smoke. It increases your chances for heart attack and blood clots. I have seen very young teenagers on the pill to regulate their periods as young as 15. You have to take the pill for a full month's cycle before engaging in any sexual activity and remember that it is not 100% effective so there is always that chance that you might get pregnant and it definately doesn't stop the transmission of HIV or other STDs.\nHope that helps."
"1","Do you think the desire to have children is mainly altruistic or mainly selfish?","Or is it a physical urge that goes deeper than either one of these?","Thats a good question, but maybe too philosophical. It´s really just an urge. Perhaps, the question is: can an urge not be selfish? When you have an altruistic impulse, you´re really simply trying to satisfy yout own urge. Let me explain better: let´s say you donate money. Even if you do it privately, aren´t you really satisfying a need to feel good about yourself, or maybe, to ease a guilty conscience.\nTaking it a step further, a social biologist, would argue that, even very altruistic deeds, e.g. if you risk/ lose your life to save others (specially kids or women), it still is a very selfish act. The idea is that, since we share so many genes, there might acctually be a better chance of perpetuating your own genes (not the physical dna but the information) by sacrificing yourself and saving a child or a child factory (aka womb).\nThis also idea explains and justifies the urge to save wild animals like lions or apes (but not geckos), their genes are, in large, the same as ours own. Which come down to saying that even tree huggers are kind of selfish. \nSo chillout."

"1","ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT POSEIDOn???","What did he do? Anything special about him except for the fact that he's the sea god and horse and trident? Any myths... Also, what do you think he wore or looked like...","Poseidon\n\nPoseidon is a god of many names. He is most famous as the god of the sea. The son of Cronus and Rhea, Poseidon is one of six siblings who eventually ""divided the power of the world."" His brothers and sisters include: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Zeus. The division of the universe involved him and his brothers, Zeus and Hades. Poseidon became ruler of the sea, Zeus ruled the sky, and Hades got the underworld. The other divinities attributed to Poseidon involve the god of earthquakes and the god of horses. The symbols associated with Poseidon include: dolphins, tridents, and three-pronged fish spears. \n Poseidon was relied upon by sailors for a safe voyage on the sea. Many men drowned horses in sacrifice of his honor. He lived on the ocean floor in a palace made of coral and gems, and drove a chariot pulled by horses. However, Poseidon was a very moody divinity, and his temperament could sometimes result in violence. When he was in a good mood, Poseidon created new lands in the water and a calm sea. In contrast, when he was in a bad mood, Poseidon would strike the ground with a trident and cause unruly springs and earthquakes, ship wrecks, and drownings. \n\nPoseidon was similar to his brother Zeus in exerting his power on women and in objectifying masculinity. He had many love affairs and fathered numerous children. Poseidon once married a Nereid, Amphitrite, and produced Triton who was half-human and half-fish. He also impregnated the Gorgon Medusa to conceive Chrysaor and Pegasus, the flying horse. The rape of Aethra by Poseidon resulted in the birth of Theseus; and he turned Caeneus into a man, at her request, after raping her. Another rape involved Amymone when she tried to escape from a satyr and Poseidon saved her. Other offspring of Poseidon include: Eumolpus, the Giant Sinis, Polyphemus, Orion, King Amycus, Proteus, Agenor and Belus from Europa, Pelias, and the King of Egypt, Busiris. \n\nOne of the most notorious love affairs of Poseidon involves his sister, Demeter. Poseidon pursued Demeter and to avoid him she turned herself into a mare. In his lust for her, Poseidon transformed himself into a stallion and captured her. Their procreation resulted in a horse, Arion. Poseidon is Greek for ""Husband"" (possibly of wheat), and therefore it is thought that he and Demeter (goddess of wheat) are a good match because they reign as the god and goddess of fertility. \n\n Another infamous story of Poseidon involves the competition between him and the goddess of war, Athena, for the city of Athens. To win the people of the city over, Poseidon threw a spear at the ground and produced the Spring at the Acropolis. However, Athena won as the result of giving the people of Athens the olive tree. In his anger over the decision, Poseidon flooded the Attic Plain. Eventually, Athena and Poseidon worked together by combining their powers. Even though Poseidon was the god of horses, Athena built the first chariot. Athena also built the first ship to sail on the sea over which Poseidon ruled. \n\nPoseidon often used his powers of earthquakes, water, and horses to inflict fear and punishment on people as revenge. Though he could be difficult and assert his powers over the gods and mortals, Poseidon could be cooperative and it was he who helped the Greeks during the Trojan War. Poseidon is an essential character in the study of Greek mythology. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

"3","Does anyone have any experience with eczema and other skin sensitivities?","My child has had dry, bumpy skin since he was a child that won't go away.  I use nonallergenic detergent, and that helps slightly.  We've moved twice, so I'm pretty sure that it's not environmental.  Other symptoms that make the dermatologist think it's excema, are peeling, cracking skin on his palms and soles of feet when he spends any time at all in a pool.  We limit baths and have used many lotions with little change.  He also has a tendency to be extremely hot natured.  Ten minutes of exercise and he is drenched with sweat.  I can't help to think this must be related somehow.  Any advice?","I'm sure your dermatologist has given him topical meds. you and him just have to learn to live with this basically.  Hopefully he will grow out of it.\n\nI had it as a child age 3 to 21.  I was on every med. there was, the aveno baths, gloves at nite (I would itch and weep) I went thru school poorly treated by the other children. Did the sweat thing too, was hospitalized probably around 6 times it became so bad.  From head to toe.\n\nAt 21, it was gone, only to reappear in small patches periodically over the years.  Still at times I need a topical med. \n\nI wish you all the luck in the world, and do hope it will be like mine,\nthat was then this is now.  None of my children have it, nor do there children.\n\nSo this is a positive story!"

"2","which part of the UK can i witness the aurora borealis? and when?","if not the uk, then please suggest to me which is the nearest area from the UK to see the northern light? and when is the best time?","The aurora borealis most often occurs from September to October and from March to April. They may be seen from anywhere in Northern Scotland. The 2nd link provided will provide you with up to date forecasts of Aurora activity and the 3rd an e-mail messenger service for imminent Aurora activity and from where it may be seen in the UK. Hope this all helps.\n\nThe aurora is a common occurrence in the ring-shaped zone. It is occasionally seen in temperate latitudes, when a strong magnetic storm temporarily expands the auroral oval. Large magnetic storms are most common during the peak of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after that peak. However, within the auroral zone the likelihood of an aurora occurring depends mostly on the slant of IMF lines (known as Bz, pronounced ""bee-sub-zed"" or ""bee-sub-zee""), being greater with southward slants.\n\nGeomagnetic storms that ignite auroras actually happen more often during the months around the equinoxes. It is not well understood why geomagnetic storms are tied to the earth's seasons when polar activity is not. It is known, however, that during spring and autumn, the earth's and the interplanetary magnetic field link up. At the magnetopause, Earth's magnetic field points north. When Bz becomes large and negative (i.e., the IMF tilts south), it can partially cancel Earth's magnetic field at the point of contact. South-pointing Bz's open a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach Earth's inner magnetosphere.\n\nThe peaking of Bz during this time is a result of geometry. The interplanetary magnetic field comes from the sun and is carried outward the solar wind. Because the sun rotates the IMF has a spiral shape. Earth's magnetic dipole axis is most closely aligned with the Parker spiral in April and October. As a result, southward (and northward) excursions of Bz are greatest then.\n\nHowever, Bz is not the only influence on geomagnetic activity. The Sun's rotation axis is tilted 7 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit. Because the solar wind blows more rapidly from the sun's poles than from its equator, the average speed of particles buffeting Earth's magnetosphere waxes and wanes every six months. The solar wind speed is greatest -- by about 50 km/s, on average -- around September 5 and March 5 when Earth lies at its highest heliographic latitude.\n\nStill, neither Bz nor the solar wind can fully explain the seasonal behavior of geomagnetic storms. Those factors together contribute only about one-third of the observed semiannual variation.\n\nThe sun gives off high-energy charged particles (also called ions) that travel out into space at speeds of 300 to 1200 kilometres per second. A cloud of such particles is called a plasma. The stream of plasma coming from the sun is known as the solar wind. As the solar wind interacts with the edge of the earth's magnetic field, some of the particles are trapped by it, and they follow the lines of magnetic force down into the ionosphere, the section of the earth's atmosphere that extends from about 60 to 600 kilometres above the earth's surface. When the particles collide with the gasses in the ionosphere they start to glow, producing the spectacle that we know as the auroras, northern and southern. The array of colours consists of red, green, blue and violet."

"3","my husband of 20 yeras has become very moody, angry one day, happy the next, wont talk to me for wks???","","It is possible for manic depression (bipolar disorder) to be your husbands case. The disorder affects .8% of every 100 people. In manic depression, there are two phases: first, is the mania phase. It is characterized by overconfidence, racing thougts, recklessness, and the need for little sleep. The second phase is the drpessive phase. It is the phase in which your husband may feel worthless, helpless, lose interest in normally pleasurable activities, sleep a lot, and think about death. The two phases will alternate extemporaneously: one moment he might be really happy, and the next he might be really down. Whatever the case, he needs to see a therapist or a psychologist. Things could get pretty nasty and detrimental."

Any advice?","He is quite a big man and my gran and uncle are looking after him, but he has very little strength on one side and he NEVER sleeps more than 3 hours a night. They are getting very worn out. Can anyone give me some good advice on the rehabilitation of elderly stroke patients? Natural remedies especially.","Hi There \n\nHere are some ideas to help the healing process.\n\n\nCause \nA calcium deficiency in the body, where the organic calcium has been burned out by a former fever or by an inheritance to an inorganic calcium, which is devoid of life and does not sustain the muscle, nerve, and bone structure. This causes weakness and inability to use the organ involved. \n\nHerbal Aids \n1.Cayenne: Cayenne should be used generously. Cayenne is known to have relieved paralyzed condition of strokes, even though the person has been in a wheelchair for years. Through the use of cayenne and the cleansing herbs many have been able to walk again. \n\n2.Incurables: This program has been used for many different malfunctions with great success in nearly every case: multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, stroke, deteriorating bones, curvature of the spine, locked arthritis joints, tumors and cysts in nearly all parts of the body. We have seen great improvement, reduction in pain and often complete healing in cases supposedly incurable. As you read each step taken in this program, analyze it and see if it can do anything but good. You will see that not one harmful thing is recommended. \n\n3.Rosemary: After a stroke the Arabs restored speech by eating the flowers pounded with sugar. \n\n4.Water, and the Diet You Eat: One vulnerable area in the human body for this ""hardening of the arteries"" is found in the brain. Regardless of how intelligent an individual has been in the past, when the arteries in the brain area become hardened there is a resulting slowness in thinking, loss of memory, headaches, dizziness, dimming eyesight, paralysis, and one of the saddest conditions of all - senility. \n\nWhen there has been a severe condition of stroke, or a long-standing case of senility, autopsy will often show a brain that has practically ""turned to stone."" So it is obvious that even the most brilliant scholar can become senile if he allows such a condition to occur in his body, i.e., clogged or hardened arteries. \n\nArteriosclerosis can be reversed if one will reverse the cause and the ""cause"" is the use of inorganic, dead, stale, processed and overcooked foods. Use fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds, and as many of these ""raw"" or ""wholesome"" as possible. Also, low-heated foods, such as grains, lentils, potatoes, etc., can be used. \n\nEliminate all sugar and flour products, and change from processed foods to live foods, and healthful drinks such as raw vegetable juices. \n\nAnother part of the ""reversing program"" of overcoming hardening of the arteries is the principle of flushing the system with steam distilled water. The amount used should be one ounce of steam distilled water for each pound of body weight per day. As an example, a person of 130 pounds of weight should drink no less than 130 ounces or approximately one gallon of this water each 24 hours. This (steam distilled) water is pure and can do miracles for a person who will drink it faithfully. \n\nBest of health to both of you\n\nCheers"
"3","what is the name of a disease that make you like a dracula?","the blood disease that make you like dracula your teeth like dracula and u may get blood to over this disease","Porphyria: The Vampire Disease\nThere exists a fairly rare group of genetic disorders that have unfairly branded many sufferers with the term “vampire”. These poor souls are extremely sensitive to sunlight that can easily result in burns and abrasions, and so they prefer darkness. They suffer from acute attacks of abdominal pains, vomiting and loose stools. Their urine may have a purplish-red color leading some to wrongly believe that it results from drinking blood. Those afflicted may have increased hair growth, and with repeated damage, their skin tightens and shrinks. When this occurs around the mouth, the canine teeth appear to be more prominent, and suggestive of fangs. At other times, it causes depression and affects the brain to produce peculiar behavior. It is probably no surprise that garlic makes all the symptoms worse. Porphyria is a misunderstood condition that has affected the likes of Mary Queen of Scots and King George III.\n\nPorphyria refers to a growing collection of disorders in which there are abnormalities in the enzymes involved in heme production. Heme is an iron-containing compound used throughout the body. The most common heme-containing substance found in our bodies is the hemoglobin in our red blood cells - an essential component to transport oxygen around our bodies. There are at least eight steps in the production of heme, and at least eight different types of porphyria can result when an enzyme malfunctions and levels of intermediate substances rise to beyond what the body is accustomed to. It is a condition that runs in families and is inherited. At one time, it was thought to be a dominant trait requiring only one gene from one parent, but there are recessive forms now identified in which genes need to come from both parents."

You can return the video within 30 days to get an in-store credit (not a refund) for the amount charged to you but you have to pay another restocking fee because it was LATE.  They also add a little tidbit that local store policy may vary.  Well I turned my videos in 7 days late and I got charged for their full cost because they go by a 7 day rule at my local Blockbuster instead of the 8 day company policy.  This is not posted anywhere nor did they tell me.  What do you think about this and what should be done??","It is a rip off.  Their ""no late fee"" is just an advertising ploy.  You still get charged a late fee...they just changed the name of the fee to a restocking fee so they can't get into legal trouble and  yet can still collect the money.  I honestly don't think there is a thing you can do about it.  We got caught in it too right after they first televised the ""no late fee"" campaign."

The other half of that years prize went to James Sumner for discovering that enzymes could be crystallized.  Many years later when X-ray crystallography became availble (also thanks in part to Pauling) this would help further describe enzyme structure, but not back then.)"

Much depends upon the type of sarcoma that you are dealing with but I know that the Cat Scan picks up soft tissue sarcoma better than xray or PET scan.\n\nAnother fact to keep in mind is that diagnostic tools often fail to pick up small and microscopic disease or disease that may be 'hidden' behind structures. I know from experience with abdominal sarcoma that the only way to really tell how much cancer might be present is through surgery. And, than it can also be missed if small. There is no guarantee."
"2","Why don't we build space structures that rotate?","As I understand it, lack of gravity causes all sorts of problems for human health, such as bone loss.

Fluids and air would be moved differently inside the station.  you would eventually have a constant wind in the station, as air is being dragged along by the station itself.\n\n2. It puts a different set of stresses on the human body, that can be as much, or more dangerous than microgravity effects\n\n3.

"2","Which of the Russian vegetation zones produce the largest amount of arable land? why?","This is based on World View Geography about Russia's climate zones and I want to know which climate and/or vegetation zone produce the most arable land and why!","Information on this is a bit spotty. Here is what I have found but it is 10 years old:\n\nClimatic and geographic factors limit Russia's agricultural activity to about 10 percent of the country's total land area. Of that amount, about 60 percent is used for crops, the remainder for pasture and meadow (see table 15, Appendix). \n\nIn the European part of Russia, the most productive land is in the Central Chernozem Economic Region and the Volga Economic Region, which occupy the grasslands between Ukraine and Kazakstan. More than 65 percent of the land in those regions is devoted to agriculture. \n\nIn Siberia and the Far East, the most productive areas are the southernmost regions. Fodder crops dominate in the colder regions, and intensity of cultivation generally is higher in European Russia. The last expansion of cultivated land occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Virgin Lands program of Nikita Khrushchev opened land in southwestern Siberia (and neighboring Kazakstan) for cultivation. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, about 15 percent of the working population was occupied in agriculture, with the proportion dropping slowly as the younger population left rural areas to seek economic opportunities elsewhere (see Rural Life, ch. 5)."

"1","How do you feel about the behavior of New Orlenians during the Katrina crisis? Want to go to New Orleans?","","They were WARNED that they MUST evacuate.  Busses were running full time to get people out, yet so many refused to leave.  Some were on the news dancing in the streets of the French Quarter as the storm approached.  After the storm, they all ran for the Superdome, and there were not enough supplies for the additional people, so that screwed the people who originally went to be sheltered there.  Something else angers me: The National Guard gets blamed for not responding, but the storm was over Tuesday, and TV cameras broadcast National Guard at the airport on Thursday.  This pretty enlisted female told the reporter that they arrived Wednesday, and were setting up relief.\n\nThen cops are out there looting Wal Mart (caught on video).  It would have been one thing if they were getting food, but, well you know the rest of the story.  \n\nPeople cry for the idiots in New Orleans (no, the ones who evacuated are NOT idiots), while Rita pretty much levelled some towns in Southwest Louisiana.

"3","Is there a foolproof non invasive investigation available in India to rule out ishchemic heart disease?","","Unfortunatly there are not non-invasive tests that are 100% conclusive when it comes to ishchemic heart disease.  Even the results from a heart-cath are subjective, although generally this test considered to be the most conclusive procedure for determining the extent of ishchmic heart disease.\n\nThere are two simialar tests which are generally accepted to be quite reliable in looking for coronary blockages.  1st, there is a nuclear stress test which would be my personal choice if I were to be tested for heart disease.  It involves being injected with a mildly radio-active isotope and taking two sets of pictures of your heart.  One set of the pics is while you are at rest, and the other is after you have stressed your heart while briefly getting on a treadmill to increase the heart rate and blood flow.  In the event you are unable to get on a treadmill, there is a drug which is administered to artificially increase the heart rate and blood flow.  These two sets of pictures give the docs. some good diagnostic info. to work with.  The test also indicates your hearts ejection fraction, a very important number that if below normal ranges is a strong indicator of heart disease.  Your ejection fraction indicates what percentage of blood from your heart is pumped with each beat, with numbers under 50% indicating that there may very well be a blockage.  The other test is a high speed CT scan, commonly called a cat scan, looking for calcium deposits in your arteries.  The CT scan is less expensive and time consuming than the nuclear scan, but provides less data.  In the event that either of these tests were to indicate a blockage of significance, the next step would be to have a heart catherization to see if stents, angioplasty, or a bypass would be advisable.  If your looking for a non-invasive test for ischemic heart disease, I highly recommend that you pursue having a nuclear stress test.   Feel free to email me if you would like further info.  Best of luck to you."

Apidex is wonderful for short term weight loss; however, I do have major concerns with the product. It increases your blood pressure and your heart rate...which is why your appetite is decreased so much.\n\nHowever, while taking the drug, I never felt ""normal"".  I always felt jittery and nervous. It almost felt as though my body was anticipating my running a marathon...\n\nOne day while working out and on Apidex, my heart increased beyond my 80th percentile (hard core training mode) in a matter of minutes and that was my last incident of taking it.  \n\nI did lose 14 pounds and gained back 17 within two months of discontinuing use.\n\nMy best recommendation to you is this...\n\nDo a modified low carb.  Take in plenty of protein, vegetables and whole wheat pastas and grains.  Avoid sugar, caffeine and junk food.  Do something physical everyday.\n\nIt DOES work and is far more healthy than drugs.\n\nBest of luck to you!"

"1","Christians: Don't you think Atheist's answers in here leave a bad taste in your mouth?","Maybe that taste is not from the Athiests, but from God's own Words? WTF is with this absolutely valid and true word of your God?\n\n""But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?"" (II Kings 18:27)","What's with you and the obsessive coprophagia? Is it representative of some underlying psychological unbalance?\n\nBut to address the question, while the Bible may be the divinely inspired holy book, that does not mean that you can pluck phrases out of context in a childish attempt to discredit the entire Bible. Nothing is found in a vacuum. Regarding that specific passage, they are the words of the Assyrian embassy to Jerusalem who came to threaten King Hezekiah. The officials of Jerusalem asked Rabshakeh not to speak in a language comprehensible to the soldiers (the men which sit on the wall), lest they become disheartened. The Rabshekah responds as you cite, essentially saying ""I have not come only to threaten you, but to humiliate you and all your people even to the point of being forced to consume their own waste.""\n\nAnd if we keep going, (NRSV translation):\n18:28-32  ""Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah, ""Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah make you rely on the Lord by saying, the Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me; then every one of you will eat from your own vine and your own tree, and drink water from your own cistern, until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey, that you may live and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying, The Lord will deliver us.""\n\nAnd so on, and so on.\n\nIf you're going to argue from the Bible, at least know a little about it. Otherwise you just parade your ignorance and incompetence for all to see."
"2","What is the single most important technological advancement of the 20th century?  space shuttle dont count!?","","Discovery of the DNA structure.\n\nThe discovery of the DNA structure was the start of a new era in biology, leading, over the next two decades, to the cracking of the genetic code and the realization that DNA directs the synthesis of proteins. There were technical advances too, such as DNA sequencing, genetic engineering, and gene cloning. More recently, the complete sequences of many organisms have been solved - including the human genome in June 2000. The next 50 years of the DNA story will be all about realizing the practical benefits of Crick and Watson's discovery for humanity - in industry, medicine, food and agriculture."

"3","Birth control pill question?","Are you suppose to start the pill the day your period ends or the day your period starts? First time user.","You can do it one of three ways: (a)You can start the pills on the first day of bleeding, (b) you can wait until the first Sunday after the first day of bleeding (so if you start your period on Tuesday, start the pills the following Sunday) or (c) you can start immediately.  \n\nWaiting for the first Sunday after the first day of bleeding may make it easier for you to keep track of which pills to take when, especially if you are using multiphasic pills like Triphasil, where the dose of hormones changes throughout the month.\n\nIf you're using the pills for prevention of pregnancy, don't forget that you should take at least one, if not two packs of pills before you stop using alternate forms of birth control (condoms, foam, diaphragm).  Use a backup method of birth control if you miss more than two pills in a 21 day pack.  \n\nYou should take the pill at the same time every day, to ensure the greatest protection against pregnancy.  If you are using the pill only for hormonal regulation and are not sexually active, you don't have to be as vigilant about when you take the pill, since small fluctuations in hormonal levels that can allow for a pregnancy will not be an issue for you."

Why is it important?","a tesla coil is basically a machine that generates an EXTREMELY high voltage.  we are talking hundreds of thousands to millions of volts.  as such they are rather dangerous things, and if you crank the voltage up high enough, you can get them to send off fantastic lightning bolts.  here are some pictures of tesla coils in action:\nhttp://members.iinet.net.au/~pterren/Tesla_7ft.JPG\nhttp://nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/electrical/tesla/pictures/misc/tesla50.jpg\nhttp://www.lod.org/Projects/Projects.htm\n\nmostly they are used for museums and for ""ooh ahh"" demonstrations of big-ass sparks.  kind of like fireworks, i guess.  also they are used in special effects for sci-fi and other movies to make lightning bolts artificially.  also, you can get little hand-held tesla coils that don't make enough voltage to spark, but just glow with a corona at the tip.  people use these in chemistry labs for detecting the presence of various types of chemicals, and also for providing sufficient energy to make other certain reactions take place.\n\nreally, they are not very important devices.  but they are fun to look at, especially the really huge ones."

One nucleotide difference can be suffiicent to change the whole organism.

Hence knoecking these ""bits"" out specifically means  one can see its direct effects."

While you're washing  take hold of the skin of the shaft of the penis --all that skin is connected --& pull on the skin of the penis itself with a gentle up & down motion. \n15. IF YOU PULL IT DOWN while you've got it moist & warm, it will soon come down as it slowly stretches."
"2","Is there a similarity between internal structure of an atom and solar system?","","Not really.  There is a mass at the center, and smaller things 'orbiting', but the similarities are beaten out by the differences.  Unlike planets, the electrons are all the same mass, and much larger compared to the central mass than planets are to the sun.  Also they do not really orbit all in the same plane in the same way that planets do, some of the orbits are ring- shaped, some are like figure 8's and others are sort a 4-lobed pyramid deal.  Plus they are not really solid objects like planets.  The present thinking, for the past 100 years or so, has the electron's orbit as more like a sort of charged cloud with the actual 'presence' of the electron itself at any one place described by a probability rather than being able to say it has a definite location.\n\nAlso, the forces in play are quite different.  The planets whirl around in the grip of gravity, and it is pretty strong but it is still by far the weakest of the forces that can interact with matter.  The forces that act only upon subatomic particles are very different in nature and far more powerful than gravity.\n\nI'd say the similarities are there, like the similarity between certain small dogs and a cat.  But the differences are fundamental."

"3","Has anyone participated in Group Therapy? What was your experience?","I am interested in hearing from people who have actively participated in group therapy. Whether it was DBT, CBT, etc... Did you find it helpful? What did you like about it? What did you dislike about it? Is there anything you would have wished to know ahead of time, but did not? How often did you attend, and for what duration? Were there any issues in particular it was effective for? Any issues in particular you found it to be ineffective for?","I participate in group thereapy at a private practice that specializes in CBT.  There are 8 participants, where we all attend one-on-one sessions, based on a structured therapy plan.\nThe group, combined with my one-on-one session provide the fundamental support I need to build knowledge and strength in dealing with problems that I previously refused to deal with or just didn't know how to.  \n\nDid you find it helpful?\nSaying it's helpful is not doing it justice, it's life changing.\n\nWhat did you like about it?\nThe group provides 4 benefits for me personally;\n\n1.  The group provides a safe forum for me to verbalize my problems.  For me, letting it out if very relieving, where the pain I experience mentally isn't tangible, verbalizing it is the closing thing I can do to identify it and start dealing with it.\n\n2.  Once I put my problems out there, I get feedback from the Dr's and participents.  I may or may not get information that is beneficial, but getting different information from different people with different perspective acts in opening your options in dealing with your problems.  The feelings I dread the most are ones of desperation, when there seems like there are no options.  This leads into number 3.\n\n3.  Identifying your pains with experiences from other people is also cleansing.  When other partisipents share their experience, I feel bonded and identify with my issues on a human level.  Having bonded with someone whose experiencing similar issues validates the issues are not necesarrily my fault and effect others, not just me.  This helps me take some of the blame off of myself, where punishing yourself is very harmful to your well being.\n\n4.  Providing feedback to others in similar situation.  There's an altruistic feeling I get from lending advice or sharing an experience that may help somone else.  It feels great and elevates my moods.\n\nThese are all fundamental items in building understanding and tact in dealing with the issues at hand.\n\nWhat did you dislike about it?\nThe only thing I dislike about the group is when a participant doesn't take it seriously or doesn't want to be there, but is forced to be there.  This becomes a huge distraction and deteriorates the theraputic value a group can give.\n\nWhat did you dislike about it? Is there anything you would have wished to know ahead of time, but did not?\nThere's really nothing you can learn or do ahead of time, as opening up about your problems to a group of strangers is not very easy for most people.  It will seem a bit edgy in the begining, but over a few sessions, you get comfortable, build repore and recognize the structure of the group and find a way to fit in.\n\nHow often did you attend, and for what duration?\nI attend twice a week, where each session is 90 minutes.\n\nWere there any issues in particular it was effective for? Any issues in particular you found it to be ineffective for?\nThis group targeted substance abuse for young professionals in their 20's.  I found it to be very effective in helping me develop strength to live my life in a healthy way, without letting substances interfere or cause negative consequences.   Since I came for substance abuse only; there's nothing I can say was inefective about the program."

Can a neck ache cause tingling on the scalp?","welllll, i don't specialize in neck or head aches per se, tho' they can both certainly be caused by tooth ache...\n\nHere's the deal - The dentist removed the nerve of the tooth, so IT doesn't hurt anymore, however, prior to doing so, it's possible the dead infected nerve may have caused an abcess at the base of the root.  The swelling and infection therein (think expanding object in contricted space) is what MAY have initially caused the other pain and aches.    That infection will resolve subsequent to the removal of its source, but you could certainly still have soreness.\n\nI'd personally recommend 400-600mg of ibuprofen every 4-6 hrs.\n\ngood luck!"

"2","How does glycoprotein get synthesized that is destined for the plasma membrane?","","DNA goes to mRNA\n\nthe mRNA has a signal sequence on the 5' end which directs it to the Ribosome and indicates whether it will be inserted into the Endoplasmic Reticulum(ER) while it is being translated.  In this case it is inserted into the ER.  As it is inserted it is folded into it's 3-D conformation.  Pending on whether parts are inserted into the membrane of the ER or not it will be determined if this Plasma Membrane(PM) protein is secreted or is stuck to the membrane.  After this you get the addition of the ""glyco"" part of the protein through numerous transferases and other molecules inside the ER.  This only happens inside the ER, as to why the former steps were necessary.  Then the protein is transfered via a vesicle to the Golgi Apparatus where further post-translational modifications take place.  At this point the protein is ready to go to the plasma membrane as a glycoprotein.  The protein needs no signal to get there however as the pathway from the Golgi to the PM is the ""default"" pathway and any unmarked(so to say) vesicle will find it's way to the Plasma Membrane.  And that's that."

I would go for a second opion though.  I had the same thing happen to me, but I was better in a day or two.  I did not need the operation.  But since you are still in pain go in again. A second opion is always a good thing.  ( if you have insurance to cover it)"
"2","list the various types of torque wrenches used?","and the formulas of torque wrench calculation.","Torque wrench\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nA torque wrench is a wrench used to precisely set the torque of a fastening such as a nut or bolt. It is usually in the form of a socket wrench with special internal mechanisms. A torque wrench is used where the tightness of screws and bolts is crucial. It allows the operator to measure the torque applied to the bolt so it can be matched to the specifications. This permits proper tension and loading of all parts. A torque wrench indirectly measures bolt tension. The technique suffers from inaccuracy due to inconsistent friction between the fastener and its mating hole. Measuring bolt tension (bolt stretch) is more accurate but most often torque is the only means of measurement possible.\n\nBeam type\n \nBeam type torque wrench. The indicator bar remains straight while the main shaft bends proportionally to the pressure applied at the handle.The simplest form of torque wrench consists of a long lever arm between the handle and the wrench head, made of a material which will bend elastically a little under the applied torque. A second smaller bar carrying an indicator is connected back from the head in parallel to the lever arm. This second arm is under no strain at all, and remains straight. A calibrated scale is fitted to the handle, and the bending of the main lever causes the scale to move under the indicator. When the desired indicated torque is reached, the operator stops applying force. This type of wrench is simple but not very precise.\n\n \nClose up of beam type torque wrench showing detail of the torque display scale. This shows a torque of about 160 inch pounds or 17 newton meters.\n\n\nClick type\n \nClick-type torque wrench, adjusted by turning the knurled handleA more sophisticated method of presetting torque is using a calibrated clutch mechanism. At the point where the desired torque is reached, the clutch slips, preventing overtightening. The most common form uses a ball detent and spring, with the spring preloaded by an adjustable screw thread, calibrated in torque units. The ball detent transmits force until the preset torque is reached, at which point the force exerted by the spring is overcome and the ball ""clicks"" out of its socket. The advantage of this design is greater precision and a positive action at the set point. A number of variations of this design exist for different applications and different torque ranges.\n\nCalculation for torque wrench spanners and adapters with a dial wrench\n\nWhen using extension adapters and spanners, the torque applied to the nut is greater than that shown on the torque wrench dial. To calculate the increase, use the following formula:\n \nTT = DR (L+E)\n     -------\n        L   \n\nTT = True Torque\nDR = Dial Reading\nE = Extension Length\nL = Effective Wrench Length"

"2","Circle , tangent and a point? inside or outside?","You are given two circles with different radius and a point. Now two common tangents are drawn for these two circles. Now my question is that the point (given) is inside or outside the region that is surrounded by the common tangents and the circles?","I think I get it.  You're given the two circles (which I assume do not intersect and one is not inside the other) and then you have to come up with the equations for two tangential lines to both of these circles.  \n\nOnce you have the two lines this becomes a linear inequality system.  What you're asking is if the point is in the area bounded by one line on top and the other line on the bottom, so write these two lines as two inequalities.   Example: \n\ny1 < mx1 + b\n\ny2 > mx2 + b\n\nI think this is the format, it's been a while since I did stuff like this.  You can graph it by shading the area between the lines.\n\nAnyway, once you have this it's pretty easy: if a point satisfies both inequalities then it's inside the area.  If not, then it's outside.\n\nOkay, how to draw the tangent lines?  Well, this is a little trick to explain, it would be easier if I could graph it.  But the thing to remember is that by definition a tangent line is perpendicular to the circle at that point.  Thus if you draw a line connecting the centers of the two circles, and then draw one tangent line to the circles, then draw a line connecting the center of each circle to the tangent point on each circle, you will see that you have two similar right triangles that share the same angle.\n\nAt this point I don't think you need to use trignometry to find the equations of the tangent line ... but my mind is slipping a bit at this point and I need a moment to think it out.\n\nupdate:  I found the solution to finding the tangent to 2 circles knowing only the center points and the radii, but I'd have to draw you a picture to show you how.  It's complicated, as it involves a bunch of similar right triangles."

Just check around; somebody will have a reasonable price. The frames are what really cost; they cost only pennies to make. \nAlso, I learned (accidentally) that there is a significant price difference depending on the optometrists office. They are privately owned, so they can charge what they want. I saw glasses that I wanted, this store was in the mall, in a trendy area of town. Their price for the same frames was nearly $75 more than what I had seen at a different office. In my experience, the prices online cannot be beat.\nAlso, if you have the lenses put in elsewhere, go someplace reputable. Some years back, I had lenses put in my sunglass frames. As it turned out, the lenses were of a very poor quality; I guess that's why the price was so good!"

What would I eventually die from?","","It would be a competeition whether you died from vitamin deficiency or protein deficiency first. I'm betting on protein deficiency in an adult or late teen.\n\nNot only are bananas horrendously lacking in protein, they are also an incomplete source of protein. What that means is that they lack several essential amino acids that the body needs to make the protein it requires. The practical upshot is that no matter how much you ate your body would be totally incapable of manufacturing digestive or other enzymes or repairing damage. First you would experience constant lethargy. Then your stomach and ankles would bloat tremendously like the typical famine child. Then you would start suffering nausea and diarrhea. Then you would notice that your wounds wouldn't heal for months. Then you'd notice your hair starting to thin. Then the lethargy would increase and you'd spend more and more time asleep. One day you wouldn't wake up.\n\nI'd give you a year to live, 18 months at most."

"3","what does sciatica come from?","","Hi !!!\n\n""Sciatica definition: To clarify medical terminology, the term sciatica (often misspelled as ciatica or siatica) is often used very broadly to describe any form of pain that radiates into the leg.  However, this is not technically correct. True sciatica occurs when the sciatic nerve is pinched or irritated and the pain along the sciatic nerve is caused by this nerve (radicular pain). When the pain is referred to the leg from a joint problem (called referred pain), using the term sciatica is not technically correct. This type of referred pain (e.g. from arthritis or other joint problems) is quite common.""\n\n""Overview of sciatica causes and symptoms: Sciatica—pain along the large sciatic nerve that runs from the lower back down the back of each leg—is a relatively common form of low back pain and leg pain. This pain along the sciatic nerve can be caused when a root that helps form the sciatic nerve is pinched or irritated. \n\nSciatica is usually caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve from a herniated disc (also referred to as a ruptured disc, pinched nerve, slipped disk, etc.). The problem is often diagnosed as a ""radiculopathy"", meaning that a disc has protruded from its normal position in the vertebral column and is putting pressure on the radicular nerve (nerve root) in the lower back, which forms part of the sciatic nerve.\n\nSciatica occurs most frequently in people between 30 and 50 years of age. Often a particular event or injury does not cause sciatica, but rather it may develop as a result of general wear and tear on the structures of the lower spine. The vast majority of people who experience sciatica get better with time (usually a few weeks or months) and find pain relief with non-surgical treatments."" \n\n""One or more of the following sensations may occur as a result of sciatica:\n\n>Pain in the rear or leg that is worse when sitting\n\n>Burning or tingling down the leg\n\n>Weakness, numbness or difficulty moving the leg or foot\n\n>A constant pain on one side of the rear\n\n>A shooting pain that makes it difficult to stand up\n\n>Low back pain may be present along with the leg pain, but usually the low back pain is less severe than the leg pain\n\nYou can refer to the source link to find more about sciatica and treatment options.\n\nI hope this helps.  You can find more information on www.webmd.com and www.mercksource.com.  Take a look.\n\n\n>>> Naveen Kumar"

"1","How can some chirstians tell Homo/lesbians that they are going to hell but if you murder someone you wont?","i just dont get it. it boggles the mind so someone can be  a mass murder and still go to heaven ?","Just make sure you understand that God loves the individual, however, their behavior and life choice will lead them into bondage that will harden their hearts to God's eternal salvation. Because Homosexuality involves so much emotional investment, it is almost impossible to tell the them the truth without being labeled with very harsh epithets. \n\nThe homosexual has just as much access to salvation and forgiveness that the murder or even average person. The only difference is that most murderers know that they have done something wrong, and most homosexuals see their behavior as acceptible. So who is going to gain forgiveness?

Everything you need is in the box, except the experience to know how to do it right.  It would be nice to have the right equipment, also, instead of just your pocket knife and sandpaper.\n\nIf you are hell-bent on doing this yourself, I'd suggest you buy a box. Mix it up and play with it without putting it in your denture at all.  See what it feels like when you mix it, how long it takes to harden, etc.  Mostly, see if it looks like it will be enough to do the whole job.\n\nIf you still want to proceed, go buy two more boxes, because there is probably not enough in just one.  Mix both boxes and follow the directions.  If they don't already tell you this in the directions, COVER the outer surface of your denture with Vaseline or (better) baby oil to keep the stuff from sticking where you don't want it to.

"3","after a year at the gym how can i lose my belly fat?","","First, it is mostly not your fault that you have excess belly fat (if that is what it is). You need to re-learn everything that this society has taught you about eating food. It has not just hurt you. It has made (according to Atlantic Monthly magazine) obesity the # 1 health problem in the world, replacing hunger and infectious disease. So this keeps getting worse, not better. So you are a victim of this PANDEMIC (epidemic).\n\nSo if you want to continue being a victim then just keep doing what you are doing. If not, then take the time and make the investment in yourself to  learn everything on the website below. You need to re-learn how to eat. Do this and you will get thin and healthier. Do this not and you will continue with whatever you have now.\n\nYou need to learn about getting rid of bodyfat, retained water and something else that gives you a bigger BELLY only. It does not make you fatter anywhere else. You cannot burn it away but you can flush it down the toilet after an enema (lose 5 to 20 pounds in an hour). This is a secret trick used by models and dancers before an event. It is only temporary without a change in diet but makes your tummy flatter that day if you are going to a WEDDING or REUNION.\n\nBut this is optional since there are many different powerful strategies to lose weight which are less time consuming than running an hour everyday. Many celebreties do that to stay thin and you can start doing that now if you want and it will work.\n\nThe very quickest way to lose weight is to take an enema and then to fast 3 to 5 days. You could lose up to 25 pounds but it is not dangerous since very little of it is bodyfat. Site includes info on fasting from 8 different MDs. It is great for health. Even Jesus did it. Plus it produces ketones, the most powerful appetite suppressant. Plus metabolism speeds back up to normal as soon as you start eating again. But it has slower ways of losing weight also. It explains how sunlight and sleep help you to lose more weight."

If it is unnamed, I would call it the beetlemoth, or the ytepterus (dont ask me why)","If you really want to know take it to the biology section of a college or natural resources institute, (anything with biology on its name) make sure you take pictures of it and save them so that nobody takes the credit from you; or take a lot of pictures from different angles and send them to an institut over the net"
"2","what is the cam shape for two pauses at the top and bottom?","If i wanted a cam to provide a pause at the top of a motion and another at the bottom. What cam shape would i use?","You would start with two concentric circles.  When the ""tooth"" is on the outer circle of the cam, it will be on its low point (if it is pointed downward from the cam).  When it is on the inner circle, it will be on the high point.  As long as it is on either of the circles, it will be paused.  To go between the two points, make a path going from the outside of the larger circle to the inner circle, and vice versa to come back out.  When the cam runs with a tooth, it will pause at the top and bottom. The cam shape should look like a ginko leaf with a quarter over the center of it."

Thanks.","A 30 second Yahoo search would have yieldded the same reasults.\n\nA polar body is a byu-product of meosis. When oocytes form they undergo meiosis to become ova (eggs). 3 polar bodies are formed (in most species) in this process and later they are absorbed or disintegrate. The result is one ova ready for fertilization."
"2","How do you find the rate of decay and the decay factor from data...time vs temp...time increases and temp decr","eases","You program the data in to a calculator (like a TI-83), graph, and model the data points using an exponential profile.  It will then give you the form of the equation that best fits your data points in the form of a*e^(b*x), which you can then graph over your data points.  In your case, ""b"" should be negative to indicate decay."

"3","Should I be worried about these chest pains?","Lately, I've been having mild pain in my chest area, sometimes on the right side, sometimes on the left.  I don't have any shortness of breath or anything like that, and the pain usually subsides quickly. I'm only 27, healthy but carrying a bit (maybe 30 pounds) of extra weight, don't smoke, and drink only on the weekends. I have a physical job lifting office furniture, so I was thinking that maybe the pain could be muscle strain or something like that. This isn't a constant thing, but pops up every now and then. \n\nShould I be worried about this?","Get your EKG done.  Surely not a muscle sore, as the pain would have been of  a continuous type and more with further exertion.  Although the pain you describe does not conform to an anginal pain, it would be in your interest to get the EKG done so as to rule out this problem and cut down on your weight and start doing aerobic exercises regularly."

"2","Have you ever had an experiment of seeing something or being in a place, which, you had seen it in a dream?","And if you had,what do you think about it's reason?","When I was about 12, I dreamed one night that my father came in early from work and told my mom to pack up a lunch, he was taking the rest of the day off, and we were going fishing! We all piled into our truck and headed out. On the way, my dad stopped to pick up a friend who was walking along the road with a fishing pole over his shoulder. He jumped into the back of the truck and when we approached the turn off to a windy little road, he knocked on the back window and told my dad there was a real good fishing hole about 2 miles in but we'd have to walk a little ways to get there. Dad decided to try it. When we got to the end of the track there was a little log cabin, kind of falling down a bit. Behind the cabin was a storage shed and a tree with an old tire tied to it that we kids all took turns swinging on. Mom woke me up for school before the dream was over and I thought no more about it until the following saturday, when my dad came in early from work and announced that he was taking us all fishing! This was a rare event for us and I immediately remembered my dream. Everything happened as I have just described it. After we had picked up his friend, I told my dad about the dream because I was feeling a little creepy about it by then. He laughed at first but after I described the road and his friend knocked on the window when we got there, he wasn't laughing anymore. As we went along, everything was right where I said it would be and nobody could explain to me how I came to know these things. I had never been there before. We all had a good time and nothing happened to any of us but it was such a welcoming little place that when I thought about it in later years, I had the feeling that someone or something had just wanted a bit of company and so sent me a dream. We returned to the spot many times over the years and always caught our limit there."

"2","Newton's second law: lab?","he slope of the linearized acceleration vs. mass graph should be equivalent to the net force, and the slope of the acceleration vs. net force graph should be equivalent to one over mass. Explain why. Calculate the %error for each slope\nhow do i do this?\nand for the % error i keep on getting 91% no matter how i tried","In your lab you are dealing with the relationship of:\nf=m*a\nso a=f/m\n\nIf you plot the values of acceleration versus mass holding force constant, this is a non-linear graph, so it will depend on the range of your data.  As m gets large, the slope will approach zero.  As m gets small the slope will approach infinity, which makes sense.  The instantaneous slope of this line is -f/m^2.  So your error will depend on the relative magnitude of the mass with respect to the net force.\nIf you plot the values of acceleration versus net force while holding the mass constant, the slope of this line is 1/m.  Your error will depend on the accuracy of the system.  If the coefficient of kinetic friction is not a constant, or the force applied is not a constant, then error will be introduced into the system.\n\nj"

"2","how do they make liquid oxygen?","how do they make liquid oxygen? and if u find a website or somthin plz give me the link.","Usually when we think of oxygen, we think of the air we breathe. The air around us contains oxygen gas, as well as many other gases. If the air is cooled enough, it will change from a gas into a liquid or a solid.\n\nAir is made mostly of oxygen and nitrogen. To get nitrogen gas changed to a liquid, it must be cooled to minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit, which is minus 196 degrees Celsius. Oxygen turns into a liquid at a slightly higher temperature, minus 183 degrees Celsius. To get these gases down to such low temperatures, the air is compressed and cooled. When it is allowed to expand again, the temperature drops even further. By repeating this process many times, the air is eventually cooled to minus 312 degrees Fahrenheit. The liquid formed is a combination of oxygen and nitrogen.\n\nTo separate the oxygen, the liquid is warmed just enough for the nitrogen to turn back into a gas - leaving only the liquid oxygen."
"3","Can an ""outtie"" belly button change to an ""innie"" over time?","Why is it that in pictures of me when I was a child (maybe 3 or 4 years old), I have an outtie belly button, but right now I have an innie belly button? Is this normal?","Most babies have ""outties"" because they are so cute and covered with baby fat and skin. Not to mention for 9 months that was your sole source of life the cords are not small, it takes time to grow up and around it. My mother went around putting quarters on her 2 granddaughters to insure that their bellybutton did go in. {with a band-aid NOT TAPE} it was mostly just to tease us young mothers. It was all in fun. And now they are 15 and they had ""outties"" as infants and now both have beautiful ""Innies"". So my final answer is ""YES"" this is normal. Enjoy your ""innie"", if you want an ""outtie""... stick out your tounge.  and tell everyone that ShezgottheJACK has given you the best answer."

For three days I was cold and kept shaking a lot. I had no bleeding. Could i have had a miscarriage?","Hi there,\nSounds more like you had a stomach bug than a miscarriage but you should definitely call your doctor so they can do a sonogram and check the baby's heartbeat.  Not all miscarriages cause bleeding and not all bleeding means a miscarriage.  \nA fever in the first trimester is generally not a great think for the baby so I would check with your doctor ASAP - but chances are it was just a stomach bug.  Please follow up and let me know. \nGood luck."

I would make an appointment with her regular doctor and talk this over with him and tell him that you want tests done to see what is wrong, and if they don't do it I would take her elsewhere!

If you ask 10 people the same question you will get 10 very different answer. If you take their answer to help you improve what is wrong, it is not a bad thing to do. I say you should look at their answer very openly. Don't think that whatever they answered are really what they think of you. You can really like someone and still not be blind to their mistakes. See if you can learn to be a better person from the answers they give you. \n\nGood luck!!!"
"1","BNP - Good or Bad?","As someone concerned about the increasing numbers of immigrants and a decline in the British way of life. Is the BNP the only party who will defend British values?

It seems the mainstream parties are waving white flags to the Politically correct brigade who have ruined our country.  Any ideas on who to vote for next time?","The BNP 'official' standpoint isn't a ridiculous, or evil, one.\n\nMany countries adopt their core values and to the benefit of their citizens. At some point we need to curb immigration, that's a fact. \n\nThe BAD thing about voting for the BNP is that they are too stupid to govern and attract Nazi boneheaded thugs as supporters.\n\nSoon a major party will adopt the less dramatic elements of BNP policy to the benefit of us all, black and white."

It is often used for alcohol withdrawal and moderate-to-severe anxiety.  It can cause drowsiness, confusion, mood changes, nausea, ataxia, and extrapyramidal effects (similar to any other benzodiazapene).  It is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine, so caution should be used in patients with liver or kidney disease.  It should not be taken with sodium oxybate and should only be used with other sedative/hypnotic medications under close supervision by a physician."

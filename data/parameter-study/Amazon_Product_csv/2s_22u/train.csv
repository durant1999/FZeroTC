1,"I would recommend this for a travel magnifier for the occasional reading.I had read on another review about a magnifier having a problem with the light coming on. I did find that this one appeared to be DOA out of the box. But. after opening & shutting the viewer to turn on & off the light. the light began to come on. After several times of doing this. the light appears to be coming on all the time.It is small. but for taking it someplace & reading things like a menu in a dark corner of a restaurant. this is great."
1,"These are lightweight and efficient and have some very good points:- the batteries last 2-3 months with daily use.- the LED is bright enough and adequately covers the whole magnified area under the 3X lens-- the lens itself is glass and good quality- the shell is plastic and it&#8217;s very light (but may not take a beating over time)-  it&#8217;s easy to open and turn on the light and the sliding mechanism has never failedI bought a six-pack of these from another vendor and all I can say is to shop around because prices vary tremendously.  I use this magnifier to inspect seeds and leaves.  I keep these magnifiers on my desk. in my briefcase. and in a backpack and I like them a lot."
1,"Seems to be a legit 3X.  I bought my first and everything perfect.  So I bought a 2nd for my nephew - but that one had the light issue someone else mentioned (really dim. flickering).  Before I sent it back. I wanted to check the batteries - so I unscrewed where they are. took them out. but it looked like the contact on the right battery on the unit(uses 2 small watch-like ones) had some kind of grime on it - wiped that off. and I also bent the little tab to stick out a little more to give it a better contact on the battery - did that for the other side as well (it's different because of the +/- but you can bend both sides out a little).  After that. put the batteries back in and it works like my good one."
1,"I'll admit it.  I fought like crazy when people started suggesting that I get a magnifying glass.  Yes. I could no longer some menu descriptions. especially in low light.  And when I needed to see the model number on an electronic device's sticker. and couldn't. well. that was a problem too.  After I accepted that I had a problem. I refused to get an old-fashioned magnifier. like my mother uses.  So. I looked around and this caught my eye (haha). I've been using it for a few weeks now and I love it.  It is black and sleek. and. yes gets the job done.  And. those low light environments?  No longer a problem. since this has a built in light that turns on when you slide open the magnifier."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
1,"This is a great little portable magnifier with light.  I bought 2 of them so I could keep one in my purse and have one for my desk.  However. my husband liked the blue one so much he took off with one and now I need to re-order!It is slightly curved so it feels good in your grip.  Closed. it measures about as long as your standard full-sized desktop mouse and about a half inch thick.  The viewing glass area is about as big as the face/screen of a flip style cell phone.  When open it emits an impressively strong light that works like a champ in the darkest of rooms. As it is an LED light it should have a very long operating life as LEDs don't require a lot of power.  Presumably the battery could be changed if needed as there is a small door with a single screw located behind where the light is housed.  5 stars!"
1,"This magnifier has nothing to cover it when not in use.I compared it with a Carson 3x magnifier and this one did not seem as clear as the Carson - hard to see the furigana clearly in Japanese comic books with this one.The Carson ones come with a cover.I would recommend the Carson 5x if you are looking for good size enlarging.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out MagnifierI wish I had skipped the 3x and gone with the 5x only.For this one in the 3x. the light works well and lights things up nicely.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out Magnifier"
1,"purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier. this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu. for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page."
1,"This magnifier is convenient. in that it is in a container. so it prevents scratches on the glass. but it's a lot bulkier than I expected it to be. Also. you have to move the angle of the glass around or the lettering looks distorted at times. and I don't like the 6x magnifier at the bottom right corner of the lens - it's distracting. The LED light comes in extremely handy in the dark. and is nice and bright. but only on the side of the glass that the light is located. It does it's job. i guess. but not what I expected."
1,"I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times. that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients. etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money."
1,"Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However. I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling. even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass. but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes."

1,"ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging. but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale. Lights powered by them are semi-bright. and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier. MyBatterySupplier. I ordered the50-pack. which did come in the new hologram package. and the difference was dramatic.  Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant. and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars."
1,"This is a great price for batteries. you could pay a couple of bucks a retail store for only 1 or 2 when you can get 10 on Amazon!  These little LR44's are found in so many of my children's toys. the Thomas the Tank Engine cars that talk. Tinkerbell that glows. Christmas ornaments. even some little cheap twirling lights bought at the dollar store.  I have ordered these twice now. because something new dies and I find that it needs the same kind of battery.  It's definitely more economical to buy in this quantity than buying a couple at a time!  They also work well and last. too.  Stock up HERE!!"
1,"Bought 3 packs. prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $3 each. but they are easy to check in the card and all were good.  Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I hadn't reviewed them.  Very pleased.BTW. it is true that the description is misleading. the batteries I received are alkaline. not silver-oxide.  I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices. but for toys and flashlights. alkaline is a better value."
1,"I've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera. I've had the same problem: I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later. I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day. having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries. I'd had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin. and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them."
1,"In this day and age it is hard to understand why everyone isn't using rechargable batteries.  I own about 6 packs of these batteries.  They are wonderful.  I bet I have saved hundreds of dollars so far and keep saving.  Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times.  I absolutely refuse to by disposable batteries for the most part.  It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal energizer alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power.  For example Digital Camera's take a lot of power.  But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now.  I highly recommend them to everyone."
1,"I use my rechargable batteries for just about everything. Be it remote controls. cameras.and flashlights and I haven't noticed any rapid deteriorating of the batteries. Recharging takes about 12 hrs but I keep extra just in case. The only issue I have had is the price - it keeps going up. I've seen them priced as high as $12 for the 4 pack. I have also seen them as low as $7.99 at Menards they average about $9.99. If you decide to use rechargable batteries just make sure you have extra ones for when they run down."
1,"I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use. they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not 'Great for the environment' if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :("
1,"I have mixed feelings about these batteries.  They take a good charge and hold it better than my Duracell rechargebles. but still lose about 10% overnight.  I use them to power a one-LED night light outdoors.  It keeps it bright for at least three nights if I remember to turn it off during the day.  One of the four batteries is a little loosey-goosey.  Sometimes it only charges about 75%. though another recharge cycle will restore it to full again.  Considering other reviewers' comments about funky batteries. maybe they should tighten their quality control."
1,"I have 4 kids and we were using batteries like crazy.  I don't necessarily like throwing all of those batteries away when there are rechargables.  I went to the store without doing any research first and just picked up these Energizers 2500mAhs.  Needless to say. most don't work after a year.  I couldn't get my programmable thermastat to even work because it had such a low charge coming straight off of the charger.  And today. my sons batteries died in his guitar. took the ones that had just gotten done in the charger and they didn't even last five minutes. and boy he wasn't very happy.  I think I would have been better off getting those junky ones from the dollar store.  Look for a better brand!"
1,"I originally got this for my daughter's leapfrog leap pad. She was going through batteries every couple of days. so rather than go broke buying batteries. I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries. 4 Batteries Included. which gives us a set to put in her leap pad. and a set to keep on the charger charged.  It charges well. and is always ready when I need to swap them out. It is definite woth the money. especially if you go through a lot of batteries."
1,"I was going through quite a few batteries for my cats' toys: there's a chase-the-string toy. a chase-the-mouse-tail toy. and a whoo-hoo!-chase-the-laser dot toy.  Using the rechargeable batteries works well - I have an Energizer charger and two sets of 4 AAs to rotate. so they've always got something ready to pounce on!  I'm saving money and not throwing away so many batteries. and the cats don't notice the difference!"
1,"While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands. I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.  I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience. as it depends what you use them for. but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use.  They're nearly worthless to me.  I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year. so hopefully those will work as promised.  I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these.  Try another brand."
1,"I'm a die hard geocacher - and the best AA batteries I can find for long life are the Energizer Lithium 9x batteries. but they are expensive and it bothers me to dispose of so many batteries (even recycled) in a year.  SO. I bought two sets of these and a charger and they work well.  Not great. but well.  I have to change batters in the outdoor GPS twice for a full day of caching whereas I could go all day on the Lithium 9x ones.  Sort of an inconvenience. but going green on anything seems to have it's convenience price tag...Good batteries.  Have the Rayovac rechargeable AA's as well and these seem to be a LITTLE longer lasting on a full charge."
1,"I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it's completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn't pump water anymore. I wouldn't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out. the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they'll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt. Overall I'd rate this unit as 'build quality: poor. life span: short. effectiveness: disappointing'."
1,"Duracell 9 volts are the only batteries I use in the wireless microphones we use for our instructional video business. We replace the batteries before every shoot and sometime run for up to 10 hours non-stop. Wireless microphones use a lot of power and we have found that the Duracell batteries can make it through an entire day of shooting. lasting about 25% longer than the less expensive generic types we tried before.We also use Duracell 9 volts in our smoke detectors at home. They might be more expensive than some. but they are worth it in the long run.Highly recommended!"
1,"Although I'm sure my local fire department will cringe if they read this. I buy these things for our backups for our fire alarms and they last over 4 years!  Wow!  Now if I buy a knockoff brand. or even Energizer. I can only get 18 months out of them before they start squealing to be replaced.  Plus. this 8 battery pack makes it awfully simple to have them around when it comes time to change them. and it's the right number for my house.  Love these Duracells!  Highly. highly recommend!"
1,"You want a battery that is going to last. then you can't go wrong with this one. I bought the 8 count because my garbage can needs 4 and the shelf life of these batteries is so good that I have no doubt it will provide me with the many months of use. Since I have the first 4 still being used. going on 7 months now. I am going to guess at least 1 year before I will need to replace so yes. a good purchase price for this 8 pack."
1,"For most people. that's what you will need these for.  And once that stupid thing starts beeping at 3 AM (I swear its programmed in that way by some sadist at Big Smoke Detector). you are going to want to have a 9 volt ready.  Because you are not the kind of monster who would let your family burn to death (well probably smoke to death if we are honest) cause you were too cheap or lazy to replace the battery.  That's not how you want to get on the local news (that or &#34;local cat hoarder in Guinness Book of World Records&#34;).Given that these have the &#34;Durablock&#34; feature they have a long guaranteed shelf life. so feel free to splurge on this 4 pack of 9 volts.  You will be safe. and feel like a big spender."
1,"Of all the batteries I use. I really dislike D size. They're heavy. and I understand that they have to be. So the question was. do I want to spend a small fortune on rechargeable D's or get the tried an true Duracell D. You know the answer. I use these in one huge flashlight and in two motion sensor lights on our house. I can't tell you that these are better than the bunny batteries. but from my experience. these just keep going. and going. and going. Since the motion sensors are used on a nightly basis (the sensors have picked up raccoons. skunks. and opossums which we didn't even know we had in suburbia). I think it's amazing that we haven't had to replace the batteries yet. and the light is still as strong as ever."
1,"I've used Duracell batteries for years. and they've always been reliable. I would like to mention two things that stood out with the most recent D-cell Duracells (8-count package) that I bought in the 8-pack:* The expiration date is December 2023. more than ten years after I purchased them.* The packaging is some of the best that I've seen for batteries. and if you don't need all eight of them now. the packaging also serves as a nice. resealable container. Also. it was extremely easy to open. needing only a small pair of scissors to cut where indicated.I also recently purchased an 8-count package of Duracell C-cells. The same comments apply. except that the packaging is different (cardboard instead of plastic) than the packaging the D-cells came in. and the expiration date is only nine years out.Call me a very satisfied customer."
1,"Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap."
1,"This is just a battery right? (Duracell Coppertop with Duralock)The D cells I received from Amazon have a expiration date on the battery Dec 2022. Bought these Dec 2012. so I get 10years. See photo in customer photo section.Great to see expiration date on battery!!  NO MORE GUESSING if they're too old.My D cells came in a plastic box suitable for storage.Price here on Amazon for 8 D cell was much lower than any retail outlet.Good price. fresh batteries. 5 starsShips from and Sold by Amazon"
1,"Duracell batteries are my favorite for reliability and endurance.  In my opinion. they provide more continuous output than any other competitor battery. The chief competitor. Energizer. does not last as long in my appliances than does the Duracell.  So. when I buy batteries. I buy Duracell.  This said. be aware of the following facts:  Duracell's cost slightly more than Energizers. so perhaps the Energizers are more economical in the long-run.  Second. always check the expiration date on the batteries.  If the expiration date is near. return them and ask for the package with the  longest expiration date.  Finally. store batteries in the refrigerator for longest storage life.  Shelf life at room temperature depletes all batteries.kone"
1,"Needed to purchase these to power a portable fan. Came well packaged with no damage (from Amazon proper) and the expiration date was years in advance.  Batteries performed as expected. pricing a bit more than 3 hours of continuous power to a portable fan set on &#8220;high&#8221;......  Basically. these are very expensive to use and other types of batteries (re: rechargeable) would be a better purchase although there are just times when only a &#8220;D&#8221; Cell will do.As long as there is no visible damage and your exp. date is ok. these Duracell Alkaline Coppertops should perform well. I have never had any trouble with them over the years."
1,"Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks.  Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries.  I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong:  They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes.  Note to seller:  How long did you think you'd get away with selling dead (and possibly fake) batteries?  Note to Amazon:  Please investigate this seller!"
1,"I purchased quite a few toys over Christmas that required batteries. Luckily Amazon has batteries at a low price in large bulk to cover my needs.The batteries show up in Amazons no frills frustration free packaging with an expiration date several days out. Other individuals. unfortunately. have received batteries near or past their expiration date as well as less than acceptable packaging. I would do two things:1) Make sure when you are ordering the batteries that you are ordering from amazon itself and not one of the other vendors that may pop up replacing amazon.2) When you receive the batteries make sure you check the expiration date of the batteries and. if you have a volt checker. test the batteries.Overall a good deal on a wide variety of sizes and quantities."

1,"I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page. it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews. many buyers received their batteries unpackaged. just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago. I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are. but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time."
1,"I buy 2 packs of these EVERY MONTH for work. We use them for a digital scale built into our forklifts. This is in use 8 hours a day. 5 days a week... standard 40 hours. I get them with Subscribe & Save. I don't think you can possibly get similar quality for the price. and rechargeable D Batteries!? Yea right!! With the risk of damaging the batteries here. I don't think so. Not for that price. Duracell is the way to go!"
1,"We have been using Duracell for many years. and have always trusted our camping and emergency needs and devices we use to being powered by them. in one form or another.  Sure there are cheaper batteries out there. rechargeable even and solar too; and of course Duracell has their versions of all of these.We do believe in being green. and doing the best to keep our energy footprint small. and we have found over the years we can count on the Copper top for most of our needs.  And of course we should all dispose of them properly."
1,"Duracell Coppertop Duralock D batteries are premium quality batteries. as reflected in their price.  They seem to last longer than every other kind of battery I have purchased.  Although I haven't actually done any laboratory testing. they have been in a particular flashlight I have and have been in there working for about 10 years.  In a crisis or long duration power failure event. these are my first choice for survival.If you are looking for the best battery on the market. I think these are it."
1,"In general. Duracell and Enrrgizer perform significantly better than more generic battrries in terms of battery life. Yhese are no exception. I used them in a stompbox. and even though this is primsrily for practice and jamming. i don't want interruptions to change the batteries. These don't disappoint.The pricing of Duracell on Amazon has also been much better than I can get locally. Before I bought these. I tried three drugstores and one supermarket to see ifIi could pick up a better deal. It wasn't possible. The batteries I could find locally were runnng almost twice as much as these Duracells on Amazon. As long ss that remains the case. I will continue to buy online."
1,"A Christmas gift for 2 young boys who love to wander thru the woods near their house at night.  They have found goblins. trolls. werewolves. and lions. tigers. and bears....(if you wish to believe their tales!)  They are small in size but very. very bright and the light projects for a great distance.  We can sit on our back porch and tell about where they are by watching the light beam in the trees.They now also turn our couches upside down to make a tent and use their lights to read and play by.  They do that even in the daylight!  The batteries have not yet been replaced after many hours of use.  They made a great gift and got them away from the TV and computer games.  That is the biggest benefit in my opinion."
1,"I have had several maglites over the years and while reading the reviews decided to get this light because it is LED. WRONG. for some reason most of the reviews are on the LED version and this light is the battery eating krypton version.I have drawers full of these old ones and don't use them because they are just old inefficient technology.I was bummed out and requested a refund and planned to refuse the fedex shipment. But when I cancelled the order they said to just keep it. I really don't wont the damned thing but I think it would cost them more if I now refuse the package.Moral quandary.Maybe I'll upgrade it with the LED kit.UPDATE####################I bumped it up a star because it is now perfect since I added the L.E.D. mod kit by Nite-ize.It now has 25 hour battery life and is twice as bright."
1,"I've dropped my Maglite onto hard floors. submerged it in water. and subjected it to the abuses of a tornadic four year old. The all metal (not plastic!) case is nearly indestructible. Both ends are threaded and are fitted with snug o-rings to protect the innards from rain. humidity. and submersion. The lens housing twists to adjust the focus of the beam and comes off to allow it to be used as a candle (handy for nights in a tent or during a power outage). In addition. an extra bulb resides in the base!"
1,"Do NOT buy a Maglite product unless it's an LED light. Non-LED Maglite products are crap and do not have any usefulness in modern society. LEDs are the wave of the future and yet Maglite is still producing these style of flashlights. When I got the flashlight and turned it on for the first time. I could not believe how dim the light was. It's barely 10 lumens. if that. Do NOT waste your money on this product. Buy a pen light such as a Streamlight Pro or something of that nature that will accept AA's but can output over 50 lumens of light energy. Much more cost effective. lighter. more efficient and overall a better product. I'm sure Maglite is producing LED lights so if you do get one it will most likely be a good flashlight just do not get this particular style."
1,"I was taking part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine. and everyone had two tools: a Mini Maglite and aLeatherman.  They all wore them on their belts. and they came in handy on numerous occasions.  Of course I picked one up and I love the little holster that comes with it.  If it didn't look dorky I'd probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time.It's not just good for night use.  Changing a fuse. adjusting equipment. finding something under the desk.  For those kinds of everyday. all-the-time uses. the Mini Mag is much more handy and useful than the largerMAGLITE. which I also own and keep in my closet for emergencies and camping.  Highly recommended for its simplicity. utility. and durability."

1,"We have been buying these Maglite Mini flashlights for quite a while. I have yet to try their LED version. but for now these work perfectly for me. I know that the LED one is supposedly much better. but at this price point. I have a very hard time passing these up.We probably must have about 3 or 4 of these around our home. and I personally keep 1 in every toolbag or toolbox. With the cheap price of these you can have one in every room and anywhere else you can think of. You also have a wide variety of colors to choose from. but I stick to the modest. classic black annodized.I know that this is just a review for a simple flashlight. but I believe Maglite to be the best. and I hope this review helps."
1,"focus-able beam is nice. I had already bought a TeraLUX ministar2 extreme upgrade for my existing mag and liked it so much I decided to buy this to put it in a less scratched up case. for a conventional bulb the stock bulb is not very bright and unless you have a led module for it already or know enough about electronics to make one I would buy the mini mag LED. If you do know enough about electronics you can buy led lights. cut the leads and add your own heat sink for fairly cheap from parts here on amazon. I did this to my old mini mag (you can find instructions on instructables) and not as bright as the TeraLUX but 2-3 times brighter than stock for $2 in parts."
1,"I have been a fan of Maglite as long as I can remember. I don't want a flashlight that breaks easily because when I need it. I NEED IT. The Maglite line has alway been durable and solid and feels good in the hand. The design is well thought out like the 'candle mode' to light a space.This package has a nice holster. but it is small enough to fit easily in most pockets. Over the years I never had to replace the halogen bulb in a maglite but they typicall provide one spare in the bottom just in case. That kind of thoughtful reliablity plus nice design make this as great as the bigger ones.There are two of these in my house plus a LED model too. In my opinion this mini-maglite does everything I need very reliably. I can depend on it when it counts.Hope this helps someone."
1,"mini lite was just the right size for me to use when I am fixing or repairing something and need a different size of light rays to see something tiny or in detail.  The size of the barrel of the flashlight is great for my hands when I need both of them to use and can just use my fingers to grasp instead of the whole hand.  Brightness of bulb is excellent since you can adjust the rays to be full or small to see just the focus of something detail.  Light also came with an upholster to store and wear on your body so you can carry for camping use or hiking use or even for your work when needed.  It is convenient to have in a holder so you don't have to hand carry it.  Great product for the price you pay."
1,"This big pack was a huge problem solver for us.  We don't have a car so we navigate the shopping chores carefully.  We are within walking distance of many different stores and we do have a hardware store nearby but the usual purchase of a regular box was used quickly which meant constantly walking to the hardware store for refills.  Buying these has been a big relief for me. since I do most of the walking.  I am still using these and it has been MONTHS.  I will do this every time. The price is not painful and the large number of bags makes it a real deal."
1,"We use these bags in two of our trashcans in the kitchens.  We have a kitchen on the main floor and in the basement and these 13 gallon bags are just the right size for our kitchen trash containers.  By the end of the week they are pretty full and we dump some smaller trash cans into the sacks as there is still room and then they are full to the top.  I have never had one leak or tear on me and I like the tie flaps to close the bag securely and to carry it outside.This is a good product and we will continue to use it and I recommend it to you.  The price here is high compared to what we are paying and you might want to shop around."
1,"I'm clueless as to whom these trashbags are marketed. I bought them and find them pretty annoying. For one thing they DO NOT 'stretch and grab' as the marketing info says. They just hang there. If you want grabbing. try Hefties &#34;Hefty Gripper Tall. 13 Gallon Kitchen Bags). They're awesome.The other thing Easy-Flaps don't do is hold as much garbage as other Tall Kitchen bags. Because of their construction they barely fit our can. plus unless you under-fill them. there is not way to tie them off.The only good point about these bags is that they are 1 mil plastic. Otherwise they fall far short of what's needed in the kitchen."
1,"I am the dishwasher in my home. and I like good tools. It's been a slog to find a truly good dish brush. and here it is. I used the amazon.com info and went to Ace and found the same brush sold individually. Bought one. and have been using it now for two months. It cleans very well. is easy to keep from getting clogged. and it doesn't splay out bristles very much. I've trimmed off about half a dozen bristles all in all. and the brush still has a lot of life left in it. The UPC at Ace for the individual brush is 0 4130104554 3. I like this brush enough to think that I'll buy the dozen-pack when this one gets too far gone. Washing dishes with a good brush makes a lot of difference."
1,"We're not much pleased with this brush. It's way smaller than we wanted and. owing to the angle of the head. one has to get their hand in much closer in to the grubby dish or pot they're scrubbing. That makes it hard to apply much force. We bought another brush in the same order. the Libman Kitchen Brush which Amazon also sells and which is a mite cheaper. It's a far better brush. bigger and better designed. This one is ok but not good enough to recommend."
1,"Review for: Rubbermaid Dish BrushA review for the humble dish brush.  I'm not sure what it is about this one but I prefer doing dishes with it more than the many other kitchen dish brushes I've tried from various retail stores and supermarkets.  I'll gladly waste time looking for this one buried in the sink before using another one just sitting there looking at me longingly.Like a car that lets you still feel the road. the bristles are flexible and unbunched enough you can get hard pressure right into the problem spots.  Flip it around and you get nice scraping action.  Use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots.This same flexibility means it won't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles. however even scrunched up it still continues to work great.  So hats off to this simple. classic rubbermaid dish brush standing the test of time."
1,"I used these when I went on a month long safari. Had no chance of resupply and did not want to take too many standard batteries as I found in my experience that the high humidity. despite being in a tight container. drained most of the charge before I used them. Took two sets of these lithium AA plus other brands as backup. Didn't need them as the one set in my camera and one set in my recorder were still working good after I had returned. They endured over 100F to a 32F at night. 90% humidity. heavy rain. damn mosquitoes (ah..wait..that was my gripe) and worked very well. Did not have a problem with having to wait for them to recharge my units like other cheaper brands."
1,"The flat discharge curve of lithiums means they will stay above the UVLO (Under-Voltage Lock Out) conditions of your electronics power supplies. Today's electronics do not just keep working until all the juice is gone. They monitor the input voltage and when it drops too low to guarantee a stable output. they shut off. Normal batteries may still have some juice left in them but nothing other than flashlights can really make use of it. Lithiums go most of the way from full health to death in a relatively flat curve so your electronics will get longer life. Maybe only 10% to 15% wasted energy left when done compared to 40%+The price is worth it."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
1,"In an outside sensor for an indoors weather station. these batteries rock. I spent years with my outside weather readings coming and going before I read the manual and saw that they now suggest Lithium batteries. Stuck a pair of these dudes into the remote sensor and have not had a problem in cold weather. With the Duracells. and I love Duracells. I was always loosing my outside temperatures anywhere below 30 degrees (F). So far I have gotten to -4 (F) with no dropouts. Very nice."
1,"These lithium batteries are great. They are long lasting. lightweight and work great in freezing temperatures. Their 'BEST BY' date is often ten years or more. If you have a device in a fridge or freezer or outside where it gets cold/freezing. then these are very useful since alkaline batteries will often fail in cold temperatures. They are also useful for devices that are inconvenient to change batteries. like clocks or wireless outdoor temperature or motion sensors. If you're wealthy. then you might as well use these instead of alkaline or rechargeables. but because of the relatively high cost. I only use these for 'special' applications. Otherwise I use alkalines or Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries."
1,"These batteries really let you drain every little bit out of them. Make sure you use them in the correct devices. as others mentioned. They worked great in a digital camera w/ flash. I tried to use them in a headlamp - and they didn't fair so well. However even after I thought they were dead. if you let them 'sit' for a little while. you can come back and get a little more life out of them (few more shots/flash. light. etc). It was kind of funny how many times the camera would power off. and I'd let it sit for an hour and come back to find there was some juice back in them. If you have a high drain electronic device or you need longevity/cold temps in your battery - then definitely give these a try. However if you have more average/lower draw electronics. these may not seem to last as long and can be quite expensive comparatively to alkalines."
1,"I got these batteries specifically for my wife's digital camera and have been pleased with their performance to this point. When I first tested them on my battery tester they pegged the needle with their power; I've never seen another battery do that.They've been in my wife's camera now for several weeks and I test them again before we take it out for use and each time they've showed a full charge which has surprised me. If anything develops noteworthey I'll update my review but so far they have exceeded my expectations."
1,"We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic.  We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters. Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference. The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters: TIP: I did find it best to purchase and use &#34;Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#34; AA cells. Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics (and you don't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months)."
1,"I bought these batteries thinking they where rechargable. but they aren't!These batteries lasted a very long time. I would say about 4-6x longer than my rechargeable batteries. in my ebook reader.Pro's:Long enduranceHigh power outputExcellent for both high power devices (like digital camera's or flash) as low power devices (clock or ebook reader).Cons:Non-rechargableDon't last as long as they mention on the package (4-6x not 8x longer than rechargeables. and about 2x longer than Duracell batteries)Conclusion:I would never buy these batteries for the sole reason that they are non rechargable.Otherwise they are excellent for small electronic devices like clocks and small portable radio's and ebook readers.For high power devices. though these batteries are excellent. I would especially recommend to get rechargeables!"
1,"Bought these for some trail cameras taking videos. with sound. field scan etc.  Are holding up well (better than new Alkaline)  and the price was great. They also have a listed Shelf Life of 15 years. and are supposed to last 9 times longer than Alkaline batteries with high drain applications. I recommend the product and the seller Brooklyn Battery Works.  Purchased some more of these from Mel Pierce Camera (an actual store but on Amazon too)  at a cheaper price and they were delivered fast. Reason I mentioned the sellers is due to what appears to be some scammers selling them . Both these sellers are fine. fast. priced fair. new in the package."
1,"Generally. I have many positive experiences on Amazon with the exception of this vendor. Please let me explain; I received these batteries and noticed that they had an expiration date of 2027. Wow! I was 'pleasantly surprised' for the long shelf life. I then placed the batteries in my drive way alarm and noticed that my drive-way alarm did not work properly. I immediately thought that I had a defective drive-way alarm. However. I decided to check the volts of these batteries with my multimeter and was quickly surprised that 5 batteries out of 8 were defective and actually was only producing less that 1 volt. They should be 1.5 volts. After contacting the vendor. they had me send the batteries back for testing which I had to pay for. Since then. I have not heard hide nor hair from this company. They will not communicate with me. That's wrong! Do yourself a favor and purchase these somewhere else...."
1,"Hopefully these perform as described. They are exactly what I need. but who can tell until they run down how long they will work? While I was away from my Home this winter. the alkaline batteries in my programmable thermostat died and did not turn on my heating system. I barely missed getting frozen pipes. If they perform as described they will be cheap insurance for repeating this problem. but I don't know if they will work for even 10 years. but certainly I can count on a couple of years from them. fingers crossed."
1,"They are used in an Acurite weather station that we purchased.  The weather station has an outdoor sender that it mounted on our patio.  During the coldest parts of the year. the temperature on the patio can be in the teens.  Acurite. in the manual that comes with the weather station. recommends that lithium batteries be used in the outdoor sensor.As recommended by Acurite. we used the lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor.  We purchased these batteries about a year ago.  So far. the batteries have performed flawlessly.  We haven't yet had to replace the batteries in the sensor so I can't comment on their life. except to say that it's at least a year. at least for our type of use."
1,"These are expensive for daily use. I'd recommend NiMH rechargeables for that. but they're perfect for low temperature use (car flashlight in Minnesota winter. digital camera use outdoors in the winter) when both alkalines and NiMHs fail to deliver. These would also be. with very gradual storage loss. great for an emergency electronic device. Maybe for GPS or LED flashlight. Do check that your electronics are happy with these batteries installed. I've heard of both digital cameras and GPS units (Garmin GPS60) that did not."
1,"There are a lot of people that need more of a charge with electronics that only alkaline batteries cannot do. especially today's standard of electronics. Energizer has made that accomplishment with their Ultimate Lithium batteries. They work absolutely well in my hi-tech chargers for my Iphone and Ipod Touch. without the hassle of charging it to my computer all the time. They are simple to use and work great. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they can run. but when I tried them in my instant Energizer Charger. I was convinced that they were excellent at the power they have given me into my player. If you have a smartphone or a camera that needs more than alkaline batteries. I definitely recommend you give these a try from Energizer.Price: BCharging: B+Overall: B 1/2+"
1,"For almost everything in my household I use Sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries. and could not be more pleased with them.  However. I recently purchase several LED emergency road flares. and wanted batteries which I wouldn't need to check frequently.  While the eneloops are also good for long term storage in the cold. they discharge faster when it is hot. and don't perform as well in the cold as these lithium batteries. which are rated down to -40F.  If you need these for more heavily used devices. you might want to get rechargeables. but these store well and operate in a wide range of temperatures."
1,"I've just ordered a second supply of these batteries. The first set I used in a pair of salt and pepper grinders. The first thing I noticed is that they seemed to be more powerful than the Duracell batteries I was using before. They are still running strong after three month's of constant use. I would highly recommend Energizer Ultimate Lithimum batteries to anyone looking for the best. longest lasting battery. I am thouroughly satisfied with them.UPDATE: It's now been over four months and they are still going strong. I've purchased another pack of 8 just to keep them on hand when I need them. They have a 15 year shelf life so I'm not worried about them going bad over time."
1,"I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent. fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time. retain power even when they're just sitting not being used. and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls. Wii remotes. toys. etc.)."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
1,"I bought these for a digital camera which went through alkalines every 30 photos. After researching how alkalines drop to about 1.2 volts after very little use and then level out from there I learned that these lithiums maintain the 1.5 volts for a much longer period of use and consequently allow my camera to continue to work through about 120 to 150 photos. I also use these in the outside unit of my weather station because they will not fail at subzero temperatures like alkalines do. The added cost is worth it in some instances but probably not for general use."
1,"These are 'niche' batteries. They weigh half their Alkaline and NiMh brothers. store more energy. work in very low temperatures. and sit on the shelf for a decade without losing their charge.As everyday consumables they make no sense (for that. look into Eneloop rechargeables). But as the cells that power your emergency flashlight. your GPS on the Inka Trail. or your radio during a blackout. they are a godsend.Note that the voltage of these cells is slightly higher than regular AA's. Therefore. some devices actually *won't work*. at least not when the cells are fresh and fully charged! For example. people have posted problems with Garmin's Gpsmap 60csx or some regulated LED flashlights. I'd recommend you check with the manufacturer and test your device with those cells before placing them in your survival kit."
1,"got 'em quick with no problems. yes they absolutely last longer [I use them in a lable maker]. These are great batteries but are not for every app. I do not recommend using the 9v version in a smoke detector. The lithium bateries by nature go until they are completely exausted then suddenly they are completely spent wih no warning. The alkilne batteries slowly get weaker thus letting the detector let out those annoying squeeks which tell you the detector's batteries need changing. Not to keen of a flashlite blinking out with no warning. But. the tremendious shelf life and longer runs between changes is a real plus.PS Check to see that you are getting the correct ones for your needs. They have different life spands of lasting 4.5.8 and the ultimate of 9 times longer than alkiline batts."
1,"I bought these batteries specifically to go in the outdoor portion of my indoor-outdoor weather monitoring station. I tried normal alkaline batteries first. but they do not provide enough voltage when the temperature is low. Then I tried NiMH rechargeables. but those crap out at an even higher temperature. Then I coughed up the extra money for lithium. i.e. these batteries.These batteries are the only ones that work when it is very cold outside. Lithium wins!These are approximately the cheapest lithium batteries on Amazon. that is how I chose them. And they are a name brand. Go figure."
1,"i was uneducated in lithium batteries. i thought they were rechargeable. but have come to get info from energizer via their telephone rep..that only lithium ion batteries are rechargeable...that lithium batteries as these are NOT.to me then. the price value is just not there. for the price paid for these i can buy around 36 good alkaline cells.update: i have found these batteries to not last as long as regular alkaline batteries....e.g. i get about 6 months use on a clock from an alkaline but only two months on these lithiums....obviously then i will stick with alkaline over these....i have tho moved to using rechargeable cells for nearly everything anymore- usually the enelop from sanyo- these are very good and certainly cost effective..."
1,"I ordered this scrub brush with the intent of using it on sinks and showers. I first used it when I threw my microfiber couch cushions in the laundry and they came out stiff. I used this brush to easily bring back the softness that microfiber is known for.Since then I have used it for sinks. tile. shower. and linoleum. It has worked fabulously each and every time and it is now my go to scrub brush. It is extremely comfortable in my hand. they did a fantastic job with the ergonomics. It is easy to apply gentle or firm pressure based on the situation.If you need a versatile brush that works well and is comfortable in your hand. this is it."
1,"When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They. by far. have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much. I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time. I think I'll get two :)"
1,"I expect a scrub brush to be designed for medium/heavy pressure.  The shape of the handle in my hand doesn't allow me to just press down and do the job.  Rather. the roundness of the handle wobbles back and forth (left to right versus back and forth) in my palm.  Also when wet the handle doesn't feel solid in my palm.  Maybe it's just the shape of my hand instead of a design flaw?  I only deducted one star for this possibility.The bristles are high quality and the plastic piece appears of the OXO quality you'd expect."
1,"I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet. they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower. sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find. but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time. your hands and wrist will feel the difference."
1,"I have always kept a hefty scrub brush around for I have an old kitty that loves to toss up her dinner occasionally. plus a young puppy that often feels left out and follows suit.  Scrub brushes are easy to find and probably never considered here much on Amazon.  But trust me when I tell you that not only is this a terrific brush. but it is also very hard to find in stores.  The power behind this baby is its contoured plum like handle that sits directly on top.  It gives you maximum comfort for your hand while directing the brushes where you want without you getting tired and the brushes just slipping lightly over the stain.  The handle and the brushes are of a great quality and and I bought two for different parts of the house.  Definitely a vast improvement over the usual handles we all are used to seeing on brushes like this. and at a very fair price here on Amazon. The best. and highly recommended..."
1,"After reading the reviews. and recognizing the quality of OXO. I thought I had made a good decision. I was in for a surprise. I have one of those old tubs with some soap build up that is difficult to remove. With a little elbow grease. and with this superb brush. the soap scum is gone. Good grief. what a surprise. For years I have been trying to get that stuff off.  I am now going to scrub my stair carpet. Somehow. coffee stains have ingrained themselves into the rug.The raised handle keeps my hands and fingers above the brush. which makes it so much easier to use your full force. Thecontoured handle gives me a strong grasp for vigorous cleaning. The handle is nonslip. wet or dry. It is great for cleaning a variety of surfaces. from tile to carpet. There are two types of bristles for the optimum scrub. I have never found anything better for scrubbing out those darn spots!Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-08-14"
1,"I just LOVE this brush.  Not only does it &#34;feel good&#34; to the hand. but it's design allows you to easily get into the rounded corners of the bathtub whereas a flat. rectangular shaped brush made rounded areas difficult to clean.  The non-slip rubber grip is a plus as well.  I'm really happy with this purchase.  Will buy again when I need a replacement.  Have been using it for over 10 months and it shows no signs of wear.  Very satisfied."
1,"I had one of this brush already. but wanted another for outside. I use my inside one to clean tubs and shower tile mainly. and anything else that needs the work of its sturdy bristles. I use the outside one for dirty or mucky shoes. and to clean out our two flat. rectangular bird feeders that hang outside in the weather. If it rains or snows. the feeders get pretty nasty inside on the bottom. but we like them as they allow the birds. squirrels and chipmunks to all be able get into the trays to eat."
1,"This bottle brush is great. We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses. It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you're cleaning. Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I've used it on. I'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
1,"i have tried many brands and types of bottle brush and now i finally found the one.this brush is just enough soft and flexible to clean bottles well. The bristles are soft and yet sturdy to withstand pressure. Unlike rubber/silicone based brush whose bristles have no strength to stand straight. this will easily clean corner without having to jam the brush into the corner.Another good feature is the lenght. it is around a foot long. so you can use it to clean your vacuum flask/thermos easily as well."
1,"It is surprisingly hard to find a brush like this. I just wanted it to be able to clean my travel mugs really well. I don't like putting them in the dishwasher and a sponge does not reach everywhere. This is a great brush for a good price. I have been using it for about a year and it still looks great. the bristles do not wear easily so I think it will last for a long time. I am now able to reach all those touch spots in my travel mugs. carafes. and vases."
1,"It's a good sturdy brush. bends well. fits in what I need it for. but the bristles are only slightly rougher than a generic bottle brush. I use it clean glass bottles I fill with juice (from a juicer). and it doesn't get anything stuck on. It also stains easy. However. the grip is comfortable and it's a good length for 16oz glass bottles. and if you can find a different way to get things unstuck. it works just fine. I just wish it was rougher and a little longer wouldn't hurt. It does the job but aside from real sturdiness it's not much better than a generic brush."
1,"Got this for cleaning out sport bottles and stainless thermal coffee cups.  Flexible.  The bristles are not very dense and the bristle material is very light.  This is NOT a scrub brush. and I actually have concerns about how long the lightweight nylon bristles will hold up over time. but this gets the job done.  The brush will fit into anything the width of the wand portion at the top. because the bristles are so soft. they flatten out and flow (almost like wet hair...)."
1,"I have always struggled cleaning my tea pot and my Nalgene water bottles.  I would stuff washcloths into them and spin them around but I never felt like I was doing a good job.  I saw this cheap little brush on amazon and figured I'd give it a go.  This brush helps me all the time now.  It can squeeze into the holes my hand can't fit in and I can move it around and scrub the insides.  I am impressed with this brush and am very glad I found it."
1,"This is astoundingly dishwasher tolerant. It has emerged unscathed from the top rack of my dishwasher after pots and pans wash. 6 or 7 times already.Initially. I bought this to clean my tall ello glass water bottle with a narrow opening.  Now I use it on all hand wash serving and glassware.  The bristles are effectively scrub-y. are high quality soft nylon that doesn't scratch glass and collapses to fit into narrow mouth jars and bottles.  The handle is hand injury friendly with typical soft OXO comfort with appropriate density for a secure grip. A+"
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
1,"I use this to clean out all sorts of cups and bottles and it always maintains its shape.  Been using it for almost a year now and its still going strong.  Its really only for light cleaning though because the brush bristles are too soft to do much scrubbing. but they are the right softness to easily squish into a small bottle opening. which is what I bought it for.  I'd buy it again with the knowledge that its just a light duty brush specifically for water bottles/jugs."
1,"We have had a couple really nice bottle brushes that have recently just given up completely and we needed replacements fast.  We looked at all the stores we regularly haunt. but did not find anything of a satisfactory type and quality.  So online I went and found this great sounding brush and decided to give it a tryout. so far it has performed flawlessly cleaning all sizes and shapes of bottles and containers of all types as well.  Overall this has been a great purchase. and I hope they have these in the future for when this one gives up the ghost in a few years..."
1,"This bottle brush is well made and GREAT for most things. but it has a THICK stem that will NOT go into regular size water bottles. so don't buy it for that! I tried to use it on the VOSS water bottle I use (recycle.) and for spice bottles. and my sport jug - it was hopeless. You need a regular old fashioned 'baby bottle' brush with the thin wire stem for regular drinking bottles. OR TRY this incredible brush:Way Clean 33030 Bottle Brushwhich is under four dollars AND has a thinner shaft to fit more bottles. glasses. etc. and which is SLANTED to facilitate a thorough cleaning!"
1,"This brush is the best especially to clean out small mouthed bottles of all kinds & pitchers. To me the best part of this brush is it's flexibility to reach places that normal plain brushes can't reach like unreachable cracks. crevices & bends & curved glass. This thing rocks & I am very very happy that I purchased it & I will be telling a lot of people about it because it makes cleaning pitchers. water bottles. jars & any think a breeze to clean & I most definitely am extremely satisfied with this wonderful product & wonderful seller that packaged my product so well. Go get one you will be very happy that you did so."
1,"I am becoming an OXO Superfan simply because their products meet most of my kitchen needs fully.  Of those OXO products I have. not one has failed and each has performed as advertised. but with more effectiveness than I expected based on their modest prices.  I bought this brush mainly to accompany a 6-pack of 18 ounce glass water bottles that would be hard to reach without a bristle brush.  In goes the OXO and out comes the unwanted material.  Luckily. the contents have been nothing but water and nothing else that we know of.  A simple and effective brush goes a long way around here and we highly recommend this one."
1,"Great bottle brush for our household with three kids who all play sports.  So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices.  This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles.  (And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles.)  My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time. so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months.  I always buy the same one again. but I wish it lasted a bit longer!"
1,"I received this last week.  I bought it to clean jars and glasses.  Does not feel flimsy. does a good job.  The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality.  This is in a whole different class.. it works!  I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012:  This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR.  I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one.  Talk about value for money spent!"
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
1,"Sometimes a little thing makes a big difference and having the right tool for the job is one of those things.  I use a meat grinder several times a week to make pet food for cats and make sausages for myself. This requires scrupulous attention to cleanliness.  One of the parts was a little hard to clean on the inside. but this bottle brush makes the job a breeze.  It is both flexible enough to easily clean the interior. while the bristles are soft enough not to scratch the metal.  I also found it to be an excellent tool for cleaning the square glass containers that I use to store milk in the refrigerator.  As you know square kitchen containers can be tricky to clean.  This brush is long enough for half gallon containers. but it could be a little short for larger containers.  For my purposes. this brush would have been a good purchase at twice the price."
1,"I have had this brush for over two years now and I use it constantly. The colored end bristles are a little stiffer then the white ones so it's great for the bottom of jars especially the ones you have to clean for recycling. Makes hard work a breeze. After extreme daily use it still looks brand new. I just put it in a glass with bleach and water every so often to keep it nice and fresh. I purchased two and the other one is still under the sink with the tag still on it because I just can't wear this thing out! I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I bought one for a friend who looked at me like I was insane when I raved about it and now she tells all her friends to get one too! Get this brush. it is an amazing very well made cleaning tool!"
1,"My large hands make it very difficult to wash the bottom of my insulated coffee mugs (the manufacturers recommend not putting them in the dishwasher). A regular wire core bottle brush does not work very well because there are not enough bristles on the bottom and the wire always bent the wrong way. This brush solves those issues quite well - there are plenty of bristles on the bottom. and the plastic handle flexes and allows extra pressure in the corners yet still returns to its original shape. The bristles are softer than those found on most bottle brushes. but still seem to do the job. I don't know how durable it will be. but my past experience with OXO products has been very good. so I expect this brush to last a long time."
1,"My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!"
1,"BOTTLE TYPES WE OWNWe have numerous water bottles and stainless containers (Foogoo. Camelbak. Thermos to name a few).  Some are BPA free plastic. some stainless inside and out.BOTTLE NECK SIZEThe neck opening of each of our bottles varies from 1.5 inches up to 3 inches (this is a Foogoo lunch container).BRUSH BRISTLES AND PERFORMANCEThis brush is the best one we have tried (we have tried three other brands).  The bristles are firm enough to clean the bottles. but soft enough not to scratch them (unlike others we have tried).  The handle just below the brush is flexible so it bends making it very easy to get every nook and cranny in all our containers.We use it on a daily basis.  I donated our other ones after receiving this."
1,"Put quite simply. OXO has done it again!  The quality of this Good Grips Bottle Brush exceeds all expectations in both design and execution.  The engineers at OXO are experts at what they do and their dedication to customer satisfaction is clearly seen in this superb brush.  Anyone who has purchased any OXO product will testify to the satisfaction one feels in using said product as well as the incredible value OXO always presents.  The OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush satisfies as no other brush possibly can because no other proudly displays OXO on the label.  OXO defines value. excellence. durability. and satisfaction and the Good Grips Bottle Brush is virtually OXO writ large."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
1,"I just got this product yesterday.  I used it to clean out 4 of my water bottles and their lids.  Along with a long handle. the brush has bristles that stick up on the top and allow me to clean the bottome of the bottle very easily.  The brush also cleaned up under the rim of the bottles easily due to the direction of the bottom bristles.  It rinsed off easily and dried quickly.  So far. so good.  If it falls apart within 6 months I'll revise my review; otherwise I'd recomend it for cleaning water bottles/baby bottles/etc."
1,"I have a SIGG water bottle that needed cleaning. My first search resulted in a special SIGG brush that was ~$9. This was ~$4. In combination with Efferdent tablets. this brush works great to clean and refresh the bottle and remove the metallic-y smell from my bottle. (DONT BUY THE SIGG TABLETS -- SIGG Tablets are 24 tablets for ~$8 while Efferdent. which works EXACTLY the same. is 120 tablets for ~$6!!!). Be smart people; Don't buy the SIGG branded stuff since this brush (and the Efferdent tablets) work just the same. if not better for a lot less money."
1,"I like this brush. though I do wish it had a suction cup. or something. so it would be easier to be near the sink.  We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job. though. even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand. and while it was nice. the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.  For the price these are easy to replace when necessary."
1,"OXO generally makes a good product. This is a nice brush. But for cleaning out my NISSAN 34oz themas it barely does the job. The handle should be about 3 to 4 inches longer and the bristles could be a little stiffer. A mix of stiff and softer bristles would be ideal. It works well for cleaning out my NISSAN Tea tumbler. Stiffer bristles would make getting the little ring of fine tea leaf residue that always seems to collect at the bottom and just wont rinse out at the end of the day when I finally get home. Its a good product just room for improvement."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
1,"This bottle brush works really well to clean my stainless steel 27 oz water bottle. Here is why I like it:1. The diameter on the opening of my water bottle is 1 3/4 inches. and this easily fits inside.2. The handle and brush combined are a foot long. which makes it very easy to clean the bottom of the bottle.3. The leading negative review mentions another brush that has a slanted handle. which supposedly makes cleaning easier. But the handle on this brush is very flexible. and will bend and slant at whatever angle you want with just a little pressure.4. The bristles are effective at cleaning both the bottom and sides of the water bottle.5. The grip on the end of the handle is somewhat thicker. which makes it easy and comfortable to hold this brush while cleaning.Bottom line: This is sturdy and well made. and cleans effectively."
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
1,"I love the Polar thermal water bottles.  But they have 'dimples' in the sides of them that make them difficult to clean.  All my cycling bottles collect a lot of fine road dirt in them.  Until now. I've mostly lived with some residual dirt in the bottle.  I add soapy water. close and shake.  That gets most of the ick out. but not all.  But this brush is THE BEST brush for cleaning out my cycling bottles.  The handle is long enough to reach the bottom of all my drinking bottles and gallon glass juice jars.  The bristles are soft enough that the brush can be inserted into narrow neck bottles.  And they are stiff enough to do a good job of cleaning.  I don't believe in purchasing lots of specialized cleaning gadgets. but this on is a must."
1,"This is a great brush.  I use it for my 32oz Nalgene bottles and it works fine. but I also use it for my 16oz Takeya Glass Bottles and it especially works AWESOME for those because it touches all the sides of the bottle when it's in it!  When it's in the Nalgene bottle you have to circle it around to get all the sides. but not so with the smaller diamater bottles.  Handle is the perfect length and the bristles still stick out and look fine after 6 months of use."
1,"Does a great job of cleaning out my protein shaker bottles.  I used to just use a sponge. but I couldn't get in the little crevices (like the shaker spout) to get out the protein that had dried in there.  With this brush. I can easily get into little corners. while also scrubbing out my shaker quickly and efficiently.  The bristles are also soft enough that it won't scuff up the plastic shaker.  All in all. I would consider this a must for anyone who doesn't have access to a dish-washer. or who only has one shaker and doesn't want to run the dish-washer for one item."
1,"There are so many water bottles out there today that it's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle.  The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today.  You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this!"
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
1,"I am a bit disappointed with this brush. It gets the job done but the bristles seem to splay out easily when using any sort of force. I was able to use this regularly for about three months before deciding the brush was well and truly dead and I needed to find another one. I am now looking around for a new one but if I don't find one to my liking I will probably get another one of these because although it is very short-lived. the grip is comfortable and it does work fairly well while it's still good."
1,"I have white tile in all the bathrooms. and the grout gets stained. Nothing for it but to scrub the grout occasionally. Not my favorite job. but this brush is comfy and the handle is at the right angle.Here is the recipe I use to make grout cleaner. I think it works better than commercial sprays and it's cost-effective:1/2 cup of baking soda1/3 cup of ammonia1/4 cup of white vinegar7 cups of waterPour this into a spray bottle (not one use previously for bleach; I would suggest buying a clean. new bottle at the hardware store.) Spray on. scrub. Do not ever mix with bleach; ammonia and bleach release chlorine gas from the bleach and it is instantly toxic to the lungs and can overpower you quickly."
1,"I am old enough to remember &#34;The Fuller Brush Man&#34;.  After the Korean War. many veterans sold door-to-door for the Fuller Company while they were trying to get back into civilian life.  The &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34; came through our neighborhood several times a year.  Since I was the one who usually opened the door. I got a good dose of his wholesome first impression.  He carried a large well worn leather case.  When he opened it onto our living room floor. a fantastic array of brushes would spill out.  My mother always bought something.I guess OXO somehow fills the gap left by the missing &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34;"
1,"This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand. They call it a 'a grout brush'; not for brushing freshly poured grout (cement). but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium. lime and mold deposits out. Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand. Very satisfied about the results. Because of its narrow brushing head. the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted. It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out. I will reorder another."
1,"The stiff bristles on this OXO grout brush tackle even the toughest soap scum and mildew stains on grout with ease - even older white grout comes out looking nice!  The soft handle makes the chore of cleaning a bit less stressful on your hands. and the length is just perfect for the task of grout cleaning.  I find that spraying some shower cleaner. letting it soak for a few minutes. then tackling it with this grout brush makes my showers/tubs come out looking like new again.  The bristles on this brush have held up the test of time. and have yet to show signs of wear from multiple use.I wouldn't go back to any other type of brush again!"
1,"She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes. so I bought her one of these. When I saw it. I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain."
1,"I always used a dishrag or a sponge for cleaning counter tops.  Then I read a review of this product that mentioned using the brush for counter tops and stainless steel sinks.  I am so glad that this review prompted me to buy this brush.  It really cleans up the counter tops and the stainless sink looks really great after cleaning with this brush.  It is also a great tool for cleaning the interior of the refrigerator.  It has cut down the time required to do that job. and just makes this weekly task more effective in less time.  It's an excellent investment and would have been worth the cost at twice the price."
1,"This brush has a wide rubber grip handle and firm bristles.  What makes it a bit unique is its size - at 11.1' it is nearly a foot long.  You can use it to clean a large area where a smaller brush would make the job tedious. and in some instances to avoid bending as much due to its reach.The bristles are synthetic and fairly heavy gauge.  They can be used to clean corrosive acids and alkalis although this was made for use in bathrooms and kitchens.  I tested it on the shower floor and it's perfect for that type of work.The instructions say this brush can be cleaned in the dishwasher.  With most brushes. the high heat of a dishwasher would cause bristles to fall out."
1,"After getting this brush I thought the overall size of it might be a problem. but proved it wasn't for the things I have used it on. One excellent job it does is cleaning a stainless steel sink. The bristles are long and stiffer making the task less tedious and using about half the time and elbow grease of the way I have been doing it. One thing that could be improved is the handle. It should be just a bit smaller around and have finger notches on the bottom for improved handling. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."
1,"I've used this kit several times while traveling abroad.  The plug is handy. especially in older hotels that have sinks without a sufficient stopper.  My big problem is with the woolite packets.  Nearly every time I travel with these. at least one breaks open and spills all over my stuff.  Not a huge tragedy since it's soap. but a mess and a pain in the neck just the same.  I started packing them in ziplock baggies. so that WHEN not IF one of them bursts. the mess is contained.  The woolite does clean very nicely. though. and I can clean a few days of underthings and socks with one packet."
1,"No one wants to spend vacation time washing clothes in a Laundromat. especially if you are overseas.  Having the laundry done by hotel staff is very expensive but I didn't want to tote dirty clothes around for 17 days!!!  And the fees airlines charge for extra or oversized luggage are ridiculous if you try to take the amount of clothing you need for a long trip.This was recommended by a friend and is the perfect compromise!!!  I love Woolite anyway and the sink stopper is a great addition.  I purchased a travel clothesline and pins and now can wash items as I wish anywhere!!  I will continue buying additional as we travel frequently."
1,"I have used this kit three summers in a row to wash my delicates while traveling abroad. The sink stopper is a wonderful invention and tends to work on most tumba and deep sinks. On very small sinks. it will still work but you may notice it does not hold as tight of a seal. The soap packets are a good size. though I typically only use about half of the packet for six or so undergarments. As long as I fold down the top of the packet. the rest of the Woolite stays inside. The Woolite is easy to wash out and leaves my clothes clean and soft. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone going on a trip who may need to do an emergency load of laundry!"
1,"I bought this as well as the Carson Pendant magnifier. The lenses are both the same size.For starters. the GT 532 took 12 days to receive it! The Carson arrived in two days. Both ordered the same time...I recently had cataract surgery and opted to have my nearsightedness corrected. which left me unable to see anything closer than about 4'. I bought an assortment of reading glasses from Walmart. as well as these two magnifiers. just to get by for the moment.If I had to pick one or the other. the Carson is the winner. It is less bulky. and IMO. allows me to see better. with or without glasses.It has a better case as well. I will keep this for those moments when I forget what I did with the Carson Pendant magnifier.I also bought a lighted. free standing/handheld. 5x Carson FH-25 magnifier at Walmart for $13. I have not found any better product than what Carson has to offer."
1,"The battery was exactly what I needed. it was not outdated and arrived quickly.  I sometimes find it difficult to locate the right button battery when one is needed; seems there is no rhyme or reason given to battery names.  When I open a product to see what is needed. I look up the battery number online and frequently get hits on batteries that do not even come close to resembling the one I have.  I am not sure why button batteries have so many different equivalent names. but I have included some below for this battery in the hopes it will help someone else.A76 equivalent batteries:  1128MP. 1166A. AG13. D76A. G13A. GPA7. GPA76. LR44. LR1154. L1154. PX675A. PX76A. RPX675. S76. V13GA. 357A. RW82. KA. A76. 208-904. SB-F9. G13-A. CA18. CA19. LR44. A-76. 76A"
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
1,"I had purchased (on Amazon) a battery operated remote door bell which I added to my front door.  Needless to say. the little 12 volt battery that came with the doorbell was an unknown brand and didn't last very long.  I could not locate the replacement battery in my local area grocery and drug stores.  I looked on Amazon and sure enough. they had them available!  I was especially pleased the batteries were Energizer. exactly the type I needed. and was a two-pack!  I really do tell my friends that if they can't find something. or if they do and it's too expensive or too far to drive to get it. look on Amazon!"
1,"I thought I was going to get the exact blister pack that was pictured but it wasn't. instead I got the retail single blister packs where the batteries are made in China.  Both work but the twin blister packs are made in the USA and lasts at least 50% longer. next time I'll ask the seller if they are selling this exact blister pack or if they are selling the 2nd rate single retail blister packs.  I won't return it for a few dollars but I would have paid an extra 2 bucks to get the originals with an expiration date printed.  I hope this helps potential buyers of this product."
1,"You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like. but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless. these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries. let's just give this power-packing. very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!"
1,"This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++. would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet. so I am not sure on the quality. I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know . because I did the hard ground-level research. opening the controller. finding the battery. removing the battery. examining the battery. finding the name of the battery. replacing the battery. closing the battery containment area. and so on."
1,"I bought theEnergizer ECR2032 Watch Batteryfor our bathroom scale. and expected it to last a year or more. like the original battery did. However. it is weakening after only a few months. I bought the battery December 2009. but it had a manufacturing date of July 2009. Could it be that the battery was too old? Is this short lifespan a problem with the battery in general. or these batteries in particular? I don't know.At this price. though. I cannot complain too much. Free shipping with Amazon Prime makes this an incredibly good deal. so I ordered another one. Hopefully. it will last a bit longer. The packaging this time is different (not the same as the picture shown). but the battery is still old--February 2010."
1,"I had to get a new battery for my XM radio remote control. This was the size I needed. but I never thought about getting it on Amazon. I went to the drug store and paid over $5.00 for the same battery. When I went home to install it I thought I would just check to see if Amazon had one online. Sure enough. I bought this one and took the one I purchased from the drug store back for a refund. I even told the counter person that I had to return it due to the price. So far the battery works just fine."
1,"I have an old APC UPS that uses this battery. and every 2-3 years. the battery dies.  I always replace it with a genuine APC battery because then I get free mail-in recycling.  I wouldn't know what to do with my old battery otherwise.One way you can tell if it's genuine APC is if it includes instructions on how to send the battery back to APC for recycling.  I purchased my batter from 'Amazon.com LLC'. and it is genuine.  I removed the old battery and put the new one in. and my UPS works great now.  I expect it to last another 2-3 years."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
1,"We have 3 of these. and have been pleased since the beginning (about 3 years ago). Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use (though it takes a bit of getting used to. and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while). We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory. but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss (both dead batteries). There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out. I like this latest itineration best. as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom. One word of caution: my family will not travel without these things. so while I preach 'pack light'. they tote their Sonics everywhere we go. Fortunately. one charge lasts at least a week. so the charging base is only needed on extended trips."
1,"Gimmicky tech stuff drives me crazy. but this product is worth every penny you pay for it.  Although you might be used to scrubbing your teeth (and I admit that can be therapeutic at times). the super-charged foam will actually do a much more thorough job of ridding your teeth of plaque.  My oral hygenist said that use of the Sonicare has made my normally very good-looking gums fabulously heatlhy.  I'm another person that wishes I had had one years ago; it may have helped me prevent the loss of a tooth.My oldest son's orthodontist gave him a Sonicare. because they believe it is the most effective toothbrush for cleaning teeth with braces.  We're buying another for my younger son. as he now has a retainer. The sensation of using it may be a little unusual at first. but you will quickly become used to it.  Believe me. you want this product!"
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
1,"The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners). and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing. but they simply get cleaner. More important. my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless. and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges. and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean. quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However. it's worth it for better dental and gum health."
1,"Excellent product but a little pricy. relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver. then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver. to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades. unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!"
1,"I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then. when trying to get the lather to come out slowly. you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable. but doesn't really burn. The lather. itself. comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not. I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face."
1,"After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product."
1,"I've used an Oral B since 1993. and am on my 3rd one. The first one finally 'burned' out a few years ago. and the 2nd one I somehow left in a motel room. and it conveniently got 'lost' (hope the maid is enjoying it). as when I called that afternoon. 'nothing had been found'...These cannot be beat. Like many other reviewers have said. the dentist's ALWAYS notice the difference when people switch to these.Personally. I always brush on high speed until it beeps. then I switch to low speed. and re-brush. and then go onto my gums and tongue before stopping.A Great Tool. from a Reliable Mfg.. Not to be Beaten! If you've not used one of these. by all means. GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF ONE. NOW!! You'll NEVER regret it! ~operabruin"
1,"B000050FDE: Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush  Am pleased as punch with this dental device. which puts others to shame.  In fact. the soniCare 1126 corpse that it replaced is patiently waiting for proper disposal.  I don't know if toothbrushes have chemicals in them which would pollute the environment if given half a chance.   I don't recall when the Philips soniCare was first used. but even at first brush. it never performed as well for me as the Oral-B.  Different strokes for different folks.   This Gold Box item leaves my mouth feeling super clean each time I use it. and I particularly like the double-head brushes.  Thank you. Amazon. for making this available to me at an 'irreteethable' price."
1,"This is my second electric toothbrush.  I upgraded this time based on a recommendation and have to say it lives up to it's description.  When fully charged - it will take you through an extra long vacation without re-charging. I like the smaller brush that allows you to get around bridge work and between teeth. and that it lets you know when you've done 2 minutes worth (started out determined to always do this --- think I'm down to a minute -- but teeth and gums look and feel good.) Only thing I'd like is a bigger head on the main brush. so that my minute was covering more teeth area."
1,"I charged it for 18 hours as it requested from the get go. Once I start it up. after about every 15-20 seconds. it hiccups for 1 second.  Not bad of a product.  Feels different since I use less toothpaste now (compared to brushing manually).  I feel like a lazy hygienist now. with the lack of desire to brush my own teeth because the feeling of 'Success!' and 'Clean!' isnt' there anymore.  However. I will use this product until it is dead. I also bought it discounted from the amazon gold box.If there were no hiccups. I'd give it a 4. that's the main defect (with mine at least).  I do like the waterproof-ness. but I don't need it since I don't brush in the shower.-MCUpdate: Upping to 4star"
1,"My dentist scolded me for thrashing my gums by brushing too hard and for having too much plaque. He insisted I get the Braun Oral-B. which he said was the best of its kind. I'm glad I did. The design has a soft mode for people with sensitive gums and it has cut down my plaque. far better than had I used a conventional toothbrush. Also the device is easy to use and maintain so I'm confident I'll use it consistently. Finally. I must say my teeth feel far more clean and smooth now. The Braun no doubt will have prevented me from getting some serious dental work."
1,"Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner. and the vibration is enjoyable as well.The battery life is great. however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don't need it to be fully charged to use it.The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.As far as replacement heads. I went with theGeneric Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.). They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.Highly recommend this powered tooth brush."
1,"I had the older version of this from a couple of years back. and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband. and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one. and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.For the price I paid. though. it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions."
1,"I bought this for my husband because he really liked the idea of a self-cleaning razor.  It worked okay for a month or so and then broke.  He sent it in for repair and it came back working properly.  A few months later. it broke again. Again it was fixed.  Props to customer service for this.Since we were already going broke paying for the cleaning solutions. when it broke a third time. we decided it wasn't worth the hassle and bought a different one."
1,"There is a newer offering from braun which I also have. The 7526 razor has been around for several years now and is by far the best one ever made. I have had mine for well over 7 years now and it still works like a champ! I have had to replace the foil and blade twice and the replacements are for sale on amazon. I accidently plugged the cord into only one slot on a power strip and it ruined the power cord so I thought I would 'upgrade' to the newest version. The newer razor did not shave as good as my trusty old one. So I purchased a power cord and I have since packed the new one away in the attic. I'll never give up this razor! It holds a great charge and I am still using the original battery."
1,"I've used Braun razors for over 25 years. and while this model isn't as good as some of the older simpler models. it still works fine. It's great to be able to purchase screens and cutting blocks on Amazon as it's hard to find these in local drug stores. Thanks for providing such great service and just for being there Amazon!By the way. Braun has a great. simple little battery-powered travel shaver that I now use as my main shaver. and then I use my older model for the side trimmer. The little guy is only about $15 and does a great job. and even has its own rotating screen cover. Very neat."
1,"This razor has been pretty crappy to me.  I got it as a Christmas gift about 1 1/2 years ago.  After about 1 year. the foil got a tear in it. so I paid $26 and got the replacement pack (turns out Braun doesn't sell just the foil anymore).  About 6 months after I bought the replcement. the foil got another tear in it.  Now it nicks me every time I use it.  It does a nice job. but it is crap for $30. spend a little extra and get a better razor."
1,"The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers. which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they've got you as a customer. they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's. not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)  I'd try a Norelco or Remington. but I think they're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company (Gillette?).  I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel--or trying a Panasonic."
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
1,"Although the part numbers have changed over the years. this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge. and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)"
1,"I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore. and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit. and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment). and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these. but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer."
1,"Have been using these Braun Clean & Renew Refills for several years now.  They do a good job of helping to clean the razor (after you get rid of the hair debris).  Used to purchase them at various stores especially if I could find them on sale. which was almost never.  I have watched their prices continue to go up & up.  Then one day I found them on Amazon at their Subscribe & Save area at a cheaper price. especially because this package comes with 3 refills which is a money saver.  The only negative comment I will make is that once opened. each refill only last about 30 days -- sure wish Braun could figure out a way to make them last a little longer."
1,"Sure. you can run your shaver head under the faucet to clean out the whiskers.  The alcohol in these cartridges also disinfect your shaver foil and blades.  That's important since you are shaving so close with the Braun you are bound to get unnoticeable micro cuts that might harbor harmful bacteria.  The auto clean function works surprisingly well also.  I tested it by not shaving for three days and then shaved and stuck it on auto clean.  After the cycle was done. I pulled the head and inspected.  Spotless!  That is very impressive.  The Braun engineers deserve kudos for their innovations and making the world's best shaver."
1,"I use this with a Braun 8000 series activator (8585 I think). They are expensive (so is the shaver) but the system does work.  The first one lasted over 5 months. using it every 2 to 3 days on average.  No evaporation loss that I could tell.  You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it but I am not sure that is within warrantee. etc.  I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner. so that made it clean and fresh.  However. when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary.  One thing to note is that you cannot take this on a plane - even if you check luggage.I am sensitive to smells. but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose."
1,"These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not. so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly. then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system."
1,"At first I thought that a self-cleaning razor was gimmicky. but after owning for several years now I think that this function is highly useful and that it keeps the expensive razor and blades in decent condition.  My one complaint about the refills is that because they are alcohol based product. it evaporates. so if you shave infrequently and therefore clean infrequently. the product does not last for very long.  The idea of removing the cartridge and capping is decent. but seems like more of an hassle than it's worth."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
1,"I've been a user of Braun electric shavers for over 5 years. I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean & Renew cartridges have a shorter life span. from about 3 months to less than 2 months. not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point. I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I'm the only one. but so far I give it only 3 stars because of thisBut the Frustrarion Free Pack is great. it greatly reduces the amount of useless cardboard and excess material. Good job there!"
1,"These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use. and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned. not sure why that is. Amazon 'subscribe and save' is a great way to save money on this product. since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience."
1,"I've been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints. The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is. Less cardboard waste than the old packaging. and a better price per cartridge.To make the cartridges last longer. re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use. I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so. and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it's kept capped to prevent evaporation."
1,"The clean and renew system works very well. at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time. and to improve the 'feel' of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month. and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a 'heavy' cleaning.  The system obviously has a 'cost' associated with the refills. but overall. it seems to be worthwhile."
1,"These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old. and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time. so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life. I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy."
1,"This product is used to clean and lubricate your Braun electric razors. They are reasonably priced and last a good amount of time. They have a lemon-alcohol kind of scent to them which I have grown to really like. These really work too. Sometimes when I don't get a chance to order extras and don't clean my razor for a few days I can really feel the difference. Shaving is much more painful because the razor starts to pull your hair more instead of clipping it.Don't get too complacent through. I would still recommend occasionally taking a brush and air can to the razor to get it extra clean."
1,"Braun's cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day. You just have to decide if it's worth paying about $5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you. For me. it is. I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the 'on' button after shaving and walking away. knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it. When I travel. I don't bring the cleaning unit. so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day. which (a) takes a few minutes. and (b) isn't as effective as the cleaning unit. So it's four stars. withholding one star just for the price."
1,"This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads 'low' I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3. but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large. smashed. under-protected box. the 5 stars is for the quality product. convenience. and ease of use. Very easy to insert. use. and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL."
1,"I received a Braun shaver for Xmas last year and looked around for refills to keep the shaver clean.  We even thought of refilling ourselves but after the first try. this was not the ideal solution to using the refills.  We found these at Walmart for a good price but then when those refills were almost gone. I searched for a better price.  The Amazon automatic supply system for refilling these ended up being the best price anywhere and. with free shipping and scheduled shipments. this is one less thing we have to concern ourselves with.  Great product -- excellent value."
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
1,"I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol. but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean. smooth and fresh shave. get this and change timely."
1,"Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each. this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target. Walmart. etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh. lemony. sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each. which helps to increase the value and lower the cost."
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
1,"I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while. long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in. it must have been about two months ago. it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year. not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth."
1,"I bought these for my friend. who needed refills for his Braun shaver system...I told him that he'd be better off getting them through me because I can get it in 2 days with my Prime Membership--and they'd be cheaper than the drugstore prices.I was right about the drugstore price comparison.However--when they didn't show up in 2 days. I called Amazon.  It turns out that the shippers require that these be sent regular-speed (something about Hazardous Materials). so it took 10 days to get here.  You cannot order these with the 2 day shipping.As far as the quality--they are the refills that are designed for the unit. and work just perfectly as expected.The Braun Shaver Systems rule :)  According to my friend. at least ;)"
1,"I've been using my Braun shaver and the refills for almost a year and a half. Like others. I thought the refills might last longer by cleaning my razor every other use. I eventually realized that the refill didn't last any longer. so now I use the cleaning function after each use. I get a fresh shaver for each use and feel as though I'm getting my money's worth from the refills. One note...I always save the cap/top of the refill. If you're planning on being away from your cleaning unit for several days or more. you should cap the refill. You're refill will last longer as you won't lose any fluid to evaporation."
1,"I find that cleaning the Braun shaver in the cleaning base with this solution just a couple of times a week is enough.  If you snap the cap back on the cartridge between uses. you can slow down the evaporation and make the cartridge last at least two months.  The bright blue solution will slowly turn gray from the accumulated whisker debris.  When it gets ugly enough. and when the level of liquid starts to get low from evaporation during use. you'll use your own judgement about when to start a new one."
1,"I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though. buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave."
1,"I've been using a Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges for over two years.  They are worth the money---the shaver is clean and glides over my face for each shave.For what it is worth. I'll add a comment that the Braun 8985 Series 5 shaver itself is one of the best-engineered products I have ever encountered. I'm always finding flaws in electronics. etc.  The Braun seems to defy me!!Some have complained about the price of the cartridges.  They are worth it as I have said.  You can keep the shaver clean by following directions to 'vibrate' the hair clippings out and then use a brush---I've done this on trips of up to one month with great success. but that isn't like using the cleaner mechanism with liquid."
1,"I have the Braun 8585 razor; see my review there for my thoughts on that.I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.Best of all. it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the 'normal' light is on. or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.  That's a bargain to me.  No more brushes or hot running water!  Now if only the razor did a better job..."
1,"I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that)."
1,"Having switched from a long time Braun user to a Norelco Sensotouch 3D I still have my 790cc Braun. When P&G; bought out Braun they discontinued the foil and cutter block with a generic that pales in comparison to Braun Optifoil. I switched to the Norelco and the cleaning system system is a marvel.However I still prefer my old Braun and was lucky enough to have bought extra foils prior to them being phased out. The Braun clean and renew system is still in my opinion the best there is. The solution strips the blades and foil of all gunk. oils and whiskers - it's like a brand new razor every morning.This is a great deal on a 4 pack of refills. Plus if you have a Prime membership you get Free two day shippin to boot. The frustration free packaging is a real plus and cuts down on waste - I choose it whenever it's available."
1,"These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this. I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning. raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call. I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can."
1,"The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more. the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store. and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change)."
1,"Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs. this product may be your solution. By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution. I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps. While the shave isn't as close as premium blades. the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.Two tips: 1) I  recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution. Occasionally. I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving2) Prevent evaporation -- consistently leaving the saver in the stand will help preserve the volatile solution more effectively.  If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal. covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help."
1,"There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday. once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer. it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year."
1,"There's not too much to say about these...they do what they're supposed to!  I clean my razor using the self-cleaning system nearly every day and it really amazes me how clean the razor comes out.  Not only is it clean. but it's lubricated and smells nice.  It truly does feel like you're using a brand new razor every day.  There are lots of reviews on here complaining that the stuff doesn't last long enough. but I find that they last about a month if you use them fairly regularly. and that's about what I'd expect from them.  Sure. you can only use them once a week. seal them in between uses. and make them last a lot longer.  But. I don't find them overpriced and I like that my razor is clean and fresh every day.  It's much faster than thoroughly cleaning the razor yourself. and works better than just using a brush and water."
1,"You open your Braun cleaning station. slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor. it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China. filled with alcohol. coloring. and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?"
1,"I've been using a Braun Syncro shaver system for quite some time. and have always used the Clean & Renew refills to keep my shaver clean. lubricated. and ready to go for the next shave.  Cleaning with these isn't a necessity. but it does take away the chore of having to do it myself.The cost of these. in my opinion. is worth the price for a smooth shave every time without any fuss of having to take the shaver apart to clean it. or having to remember to make sure to lubricate the blades as frequently - plus the lemon scent is a nice added bonus!"
1,"Supposedly this keeps the blades clean and sharp. It sure seems to work. But after about 1-1.5 months. the fluid seems to stop working regardless of how many times you've used it to clean the razor.So plan on buying more than a few of these. For certain it really cleans the razor and so far the blades are only about half as dull as they normally would be. So a big plus. but I really don't like having to buy all these accessories and you can't travel with these as they are flammable. I wonder how just plain alcohol would work instead as it'd be a lot cheaper. Just bring an empty container and fill it with alcohol?I'd like it if these refills weren't flammable so I could take them on the plane and also if they were cheaper. and lasted longer than a month."
1,"I have used this product for years. I don't have a heavy beard. and sometimes I shave in the shower. so I usually don't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine. I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time. but to me this is just a cost of maintenance (like periodically changing the oil in my car). Also. if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product (like when I go away on vacation for a week). I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product."
1,"First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily. you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks"
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
1,"Not much that I can say other than the price of these is much better on Amazon so I get them here. The product works great and keeps my razor in top condition. The only thing I have noticed is that once a razor is a few years old I think the product starts to wear the painting / coating on the plastic. Mine razor has started to discolor a little as well as bubble / peel near the area the cleaner hits. Really this is a non-issue. most razors I have had that cost well over $200 dont even seem to last that long. just figured I would mention it. Not much you can do really. you have to clean the razors and these cartridges are what most require in some form."
1,"I purchased my Bruan shaver with clean system about 8 years ago.  I use to be able to go to Walmart and purchase the refills. but here lately Walmart has not had them in stock.  So I had to go online to find them and of course Amazon did.  Not only was the refills cheaper. but instead of getting a 2 refill pack I was able to get a 3 refill pack cheaper than what Walmart sold with only 2 in their package.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who own a Braun shaver with a cleaning system."
1,"I prefer this ear thermometer to my other one. The need for a lens filter may turn off some buyers. but I like it for the fact that they keep the lens clean and ready to use. The case the thermometer snaps into holds the filters for easy to reach convenience.The thermometer gets accurate readings quickly and easily. It only takes a second. My other ear thermometer took longer and I could never aim it just right. The other one also doesn't have a lens filter. which made it more inconvenient because I always had to make sure it was clean and then hunt down the alcohol to clean it with.This thermometer is tops in my book. I highly recommend it."
1,"I have a number of Homedics products from the full body massager to handheld. to a neck thing and love all of them.  They are great.  While at Goodwill on $1 Thursdays. I picked up this foot massager for $1.  It works great.  All the good and bad stuff about this from the reviews - it vibrates too much. moves all over the floor. etc.  Yes. it does all those.The heat works great.  The vibration works great. though. I would keep the vibration thing on for probably more than 5-10 min.  I feel my whole body vibrating.  Anyway. I keep this under my desk with a big towel under it to keep it from slipping too much.  For $1?  I couldn't even get a $1 burger from McDonald's for less expensive.Great buy and find for me."
1,"For the price. this product isn't that bad. but don't expect too much from it.  The 'massage' basically amounts to it vibrating a lot. which can feel somewhat nice. but not as much as I had expected.  As a runner. I've tried many different foot massagers and this one is on the slightly below average end.  The unit also doesn't put off much heat at all.  You can get more heat from sticking your feet near a light bulb.However. being able to control the product with my toes was fairly nice. and I do use it occasionally.  I just don't think it should have been labeled as a'Pro Ultra.'  There's nothing really 'ultra' about it."
1,"I used to stay in hotels 4 nights of the week when working out of town. Nothing worse for good sleep than noise. a strange place. and jetlag. If you get a smoking room or a stale-smelling room. it can be really be pretty bad. I used to put the television on a non-channel for the white noise (blocks traffic. elevators and voices a bit) and burn scented candles for the odors.The Homedics device is a lot better than burning a candle and having the TV on all night. I love the woodlands sounds and aromatherapy sure works for me (and certainly gets rid of that &quot;hotel&quot; smell as well.)If you travel or know someone who has to be on the road. this is a great thing to take with. And if you have a fussy baby. sometimes it can help (although I lent one recently to a friend with a colicky kid but he still preferred to be in a car. driven round and round and round and....)"
1,"Aleve helps me for my back pain but doesn't seem to help with most common everyday things like headaches.I alternate between Tyenol and Aleve. When one stops working. I switch back to the other. This is just about the same as Tyenol. Aleve may be a little bit better but it is more expensive.I would recommend this if you take Tyenol and it has stopped helping because your body has become adjusted to it. Aleve seems to be harder on the stomach so be sure to take with food.Another reviewer said it helped with her menstrual pains but it doesn't help me with mine. This does help me better than Tyenol with lower back pain."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
1,"The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell. but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator. which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack. which feels like hot lava."
1,"I didn't find that this worked very well for my arthritis (osteo). but it DOES work wonderfully on mosquito bites. especially if you use it on the bites as soon as you notice them. To me. it's worth it's weight in gold for just that reason. I purchasedAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid. Original. with No-Mess Applicator - 4 fl oz. then theAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid. Original - 16 fl ozto refill the bottle. I will purchase again next summer when those pesky critters come back.My husband doesn't like the smell. but I don't mind it at all ... and I don't care since it works!  :D"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
1,"Its pretty good. its a lot like icy hot.  I guess I thought it would be stronger though.  Im using it on a sprained neck thats very painful so I didnt expect it to knock this kind of pain out completely but it helps ease the tension a bit.  My only complaint is it REALLY stinks.  Someone across the room from me at work asked me if I was eating a tunafish sandwich..lol.  It smells like tuna and kinda like rubber a little.  The smell makes me nausea after 3 days of use.  I never want to smell it again if my neck EVER heals..."
1,"Absorbine Jr. is one of best 'old fashioned'. now. sadly little known products on market.I do use several 'legacy' type products still including Absorbine Jr. Cornhusker's LotionPfizer Consumer Healthcare Corn Huskers Lotion 7 Oz&Corn Huskers Heavy Duty Oil-Free Hand Treatment Lotion 7 fl oz (207 ml)and Bag BalmBag Balm Antiseptic. 10 ozWhile not quite as effective on muscle aches to me as some other products like Icy Hot. it is still good and is fantastic on athlete's foot problems (burns like hades. but clears up mine in 2-3 days) and works extremely well on insect bites and plant sticker punctures and irritations.  Kids may howl and complain as it can BURN on broken skin / abrasions. but it works better than most of today's fancy (and expensive) products and does not have an perfumes or fragrances added.  It acts. works and SMELLS like a 'medicine'."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."
1,"The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the product label is misleading.  It's just not for athlete's foot. it's also good for jock itch.  My derm told me that there's no difference between this powder and the one that's labeled &#34;jock itch&#34;.  It's deceiving because the prices are different. whether intentionally or not. it does not matter. consumers shouldn't have to deal with the confusion.  This product gets the job done quickly and easily.  I can't find a better medical powder out there."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist. 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review"
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
1,"I have chronic anemia and am periodically on oxygen. and have developed nearly daily nosebleeds. My hematologist gave me a sample of Ayr because I was in so much pain from the cracking and irritation. I could hardly touch my nose. After a few days using it. my nostrils were actually *flexible* without being too painful again! I still get nosebleeds but if I keep up with using the Ayr as needed. I don't have the burning dryness. it doesn't hurt to touch the sides of my nose and I can blow my nose (believe me. that's an achievement).I purchased theAyr Saline Nasal Gel Moisturizing Swabs With Soothing Aloe. 20-Count Swabsto tuck in my purse when I'm out. since this is Wisconsin and it's drier than a bone here in the winter.This is better than the entire pile of saline-only mists. treatments and sprays I've been advised to use."
1,"As my husband and I have gotten older we have had increasing nasal dryness during the winter.  For a few years we have been using Boroleum at bedtime.  The Boroleum is quite helpful -- but it is viscous and smells awful.  It is basically petrolatum and camphor.  Really do not want to be using it during the day.  My husband discovered this Ayr saline nasal gel -- it is very light. liquid. and unscented.  We find we need to use it several times a day but it has become indispensable.  If I forget to reapply it my nose quickly becomes dry and painful.  It almost doesn't seem possible that this simple and inexpensive salve could work so well.  We have bought so many tubes of this and it is now one of our subscribe and save items.  We are always stocking several tubes as we never want to run out of it."
1,"This was a multi-box deal. The expiration was far enough away in years that I will easily use them all. I suffer from dry bleeding sinuses in the winter. My doctor recommended vasaline; that was a one time nightmare. I tried a generic of this from CVS and liked it. and then found this product for less than the generic. It helps ease the pain of dry nasal passages. help stop the nasal prescription spray from giving me nose bleeds. and coupled with netti pot. saline rinse. and two vaporizers. my nose has been happy and sinus infection free for two months. I will buy more for sure!"
1,"It's so soothing to the insides of my nose. Some types of weather makes my nose very dry and the AYR helps a lot. When my nose get too dry it might bleed when I blow it but because of the AYR it doesn't bleed as often. The only thing is that you will need Q-tips to apply the AYR. You could use your fingers but I wouldn't. You never know what's under them. no matter how much you wash your hands. I would recommend this to any one with this problem."
1,"I have been using Ayr Nasal Gel for the past two years at bed time and have found that it keeps my nasal passages open throughout the night and it has eliminated the stuffiness I had before discovering this product.  I buy it in quantity from Amazon and save substantially from retail pharmacy's.  I can't recommend it more highly. especially after this winter.  Since it has been unseasonably cold making keeping adequate humidity in the home next to impossible with humidifiers and even warm mist vaporizors. Ayr Nasal Gel has provided relief that otherwise would of made my sleeping through the night extremely difficult. A small amount at the bottom of each nostril is all one needs to use and a tube will last for a reasonable time making it a cost effective means verses nasal strips."
1,"If you live in an arid area of the country and are prone to nosebleeds. this is just the ticket. It is a pleasant gel that keeps your nasal tissues from drying out and bleeding. The person I bought this for had massive hemorrhages and was usually far from medical help. Since she started using this. not a single nosebleed. When she can't get to 'the big city' drug stores. I know I can always depend on Amazon to back her up.This product comes in fine spray. gel spray. and gel tubes. I prefer the two later items myself. but even the fine spray or a saline spray helps."
1,"During Utah's dry winters. I experience daily nose bleeds.  I've tried saline nose spray and humidifiers.  After a particulary bad nose bleed lasting almost 24 hours. I researched other treatments.  I had nothing to loose from trying the Ayr gel.  THIS STUFF WORKS!  I haven't had nose bleeds since using the product.  I wish I would have known about it years ago.  But two instructions for best success:1.  Put the get on the tip of the finger (not the bottom) and rub it all around INSIDE the nose & up as high as you can get it. (make sure your fingernail is cut short).2.  Look at your nose in the mirror about an hour later - sometimes there will be white stuff visible.  You want to make sure you don't gross people out.3.  I have to use the product twice daily to prevent all bleeds.This product changed my life; no more daily bleeds!"
1,"In the past our ENT recommended we use Ayr Saline Nasal Gel.  Our ENT said the Ayr gel would keep our noses from getting overly dry.  He said this would help prevent us from getting so many sinus infections.  He also suggested we each use a Neti Pot and saline solution.  As the doctor pointed out. you can keep Ayr gel with you at all times. but you cannot always keep a Neti Pot with you.I don't know why. but we sneeze almost each time we apply the Ayr gel.  The sneezing last for a few seconds and then the sneezing stops.  The Ayr gel moisturizes our nasal cavities. which helps us to have fewer nosebleeds.Amazon and Wal Mart charge the same price for the Ayr gel. but when we go to Wal Mart. they are often out of stock.  I was glad to find it here at Amazon.  When I bought it from Amazon. Amazon had temporarily lowered their price."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel. With Soothing Aloe. 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day. and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists. and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well. delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray. and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)"
1,"I ordered this when I couldn't find the 4-Way saline spray at a decent price.These probably work well for you if you want to use them as drops or dont mind a stream type delivery.I dont like the feel of the stream compared to the mist type so I probably wouldn't order again for that reason.I had trouble with it dripping from my nose as I was squeezing the bottle where as the mist type doesnt do this.Since I dont like leaning my head back to use nasal spray its not a good product for me personally.The product itself is fine overall.I dont like the longer.skinny tip compared to the short.wider.type on the 4-Way.Very good price for six large bottles though."
1,"I suffer from year round allergies with nasal congestion constantly. This saline mist is the best I have tried. It is not drying like the others. The spray bottle is easy to use and gives off a nice mist spray. not alot of fluid just to run back out your nose. I have purchased other spray bottles that were so hateful to use such as the spray hole too small. or the bottle loses it's shape making it hard to squeeze. etc. This mist does the job I need it to to moisten and help clear my nose..sorry gross. Great price here at Amazon also. I'll be buying it again."
1,"I bought these in a pack of 6 using Amazon Prime and considered it a great deal.  I need saline spray after having a septoplasty 4 weeks ago and this saline rinse fits the bill.The shape of the bottle and the nozzle are better engineered than Ocean (in my opinion).  This bottle provides a nice. gentle spray.  Great stuff and very good at moisturizing the mucosa.  Does what it was meant to do.I used this heavily after a septoplasty surgery and also imagine it would be good for those using a CPAP machine dealing with dry noses.  I prefer this over Ocean and some of the other saline sprays because the bottle format is actually nice and delivers a very consistent mist of saline.  The 'fatter' ocean bottles always feel like they get squeezed in the middle and become more difficult to use as the bottle gets emptier.I like this brand the best -- great stuff!"
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
1,"For some years I've had repeated sinus infections.  Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive.  I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray. it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the 'job' for me!"
1,"For someone who always has had troubles with her sinuses. I'm a big fan of nasal sprays.  For some reason. I can not get used to a Netti pot. just the sensation of water makes me gag immediately.  I've tried a lot of sprays. and my past favorite Rhinaris is wonderful. but expensive.  Plus. often it would get a little stale and smelled almost to a point of curdled milk if left unused for a while.  I like Ayr because of a low price on amazon.And here's a great tip. if you take care of the bottle and rinse the tip under hot water after every use [as per directions]. it never gets stale. always fresh smelling. which really means no smell at all.  I usually do 3 sprays in each nostril. which I find does a fine job."
1,".Recently I have been on oxygen most of each day.  Although the oxygen helps the condition for which it was prescribed. it drys my nasal membranes.  So I get frequent nosebleeds.  Sometimes the nosebleeds cut off access to the oxygen.One of my therapists suggested I try Ayr products.  I found that Ayr produces a gel. nose drops. and a mist.  I decided upon the mist.Ayr Saline Nasal Mist is very helpful.  When my nose begins to bleed I spray the mist into my nose and it stops the bleeding.  My doctor explained that the sodium chloride in the mist helps form blood clots.I recommend Ayr Saline Nasal Mist for anyone struggling with nosebleeds."
1,"After my five year old started suffering really bad allergies this spring I used children's Zyrtec. It worked but made my son feel 'weird' and he didn't like it. So I tried Clariton but it did nothing. So I search for something that didn't have side effects and found this. I was drawn to it by the good reviews I found all over the web. Well after 2 days of use my son is allergy free! I can't believe it and I'm so happy! I'm thinking about switching myself from my Rx steroid spray.It's such a happy moment when you find something that works and it safe.If you suffer or know someone that does. please try this product. It rocks!"
1,"What a great little design that fits into your pocket just like a chapstick. No matter how stuffy I get. those Vicks vapors clear me right up allowing me to use my nasal spray to keep the airways clear. There are two things you should definitely avoid with this product. First. you should not over use the inhaler. as it will cause nasal irritation. Second. you should store the inhaler at room temperature because if it gets too hot the vapors will be stronger and also cause nasal irritation. The only other concern is that this product has an ingredient that will show up as an amphetamine on a drug test. So. you should keep the card with you if your boss gives you a drug test. If you follow these guidelines. then you'll see this product is a real lifesaver when you're all stuffed up."
1,"This is a product that is intended to cure/treat an illness/disease. and HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO BE SAFE OR EFFECTIVE BY THE FDA!  *** ALL *** of these foreign medications/foods being sold on Amazon are ILLEGAL ...  Where are you Amazon?  This is a crime.This is a medication made by India (or wherever) for India (or wherever). IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE SOLD IN THE USA!  Wake up people - you have no idea of the conditions in developing countries. no idea of the quality of their source materials. their hygiene. their regulatory enforcement. etc.  I was almost killed by a substituted medication from Mexico.  Don't be an idiot.  If you wouldn't allow a stranger to inject you with a syringe containing an unknown substance. don't eat/inhale unknown substances either. because it is no different than being injected."
1,"Thanks to this little stick. I don't have to fight with my gag reflex due to the horrific smells of my fellow airline passengers who fart up a storm as we fly across the oceans and lands of our vast planet. Out of pure necessity did I buy this product and 10 years later I still never travel without it. I've never used it for anything other than keeping offensive odors away from my nasal passages.I'd rather spray the offenders with Lysol but since that's no longer chic or eco friendly. this little gem works amazingly well. Plus. the Vapo Inhaler is US TSA friendly."
1,"Decongestant pills deliver the drug to your whole body. so they can cause side effects in your whole body. This inhaler delivers the drug straight to your nose. just where you want it. I find these inhalers more effective than pills. much faster. and with fewer side effects.Decongestant pills usually contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine. both of which are stimulants - basically speed. I have tried pseudoephedrine pills and I find they cause insomnia and anxiety. I have not even tried phenylephrine pills. Decongestant pills tend to increase heart rate and blood pressure. and can cause chest pain (angina) in some people. A closely related decongestant. phenylpropanolamine (PPA). was withdrawn from the US market because it caused stroke. However. it should be noted that the stroke victims were generally taking very high doses as a weight-loss aid. they were not using decongestant doses.This inhaler contains a very similar stimulant drug. but the dose is very low and it stays mostly in your nose."
1,"I had a Cold and I couldn't breathe my nose was all stuffed up so I order Vicks Vapor Inhaler. for some reason there are no where to be found where I live. It arrived in just two days. Amazing. with the Vicks Vapors you get instant relief. in just a matter of seconds my nose cleared up real good. One of the best over-the-counter Medicine for Sinus Congestion that really works. I have used it for years. I decided to order another one and for some reason I'm still waiting for it and it's been over a month. I think everyone had the same Idea! ...Thank You D.D."
1,"I sweat if it's hot or cold!!! This is the only thing that works for me!!!!! I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS!!!! Buy this!!! Just DO NOT use after a shower when you have shaved your arm pits it will bun you. At first it does tingle with applications but after a while your skin gets use to it. I did have a rash/burn looking after first application. But using it when I did not just come out of the shower and/or shaving it works best!"
1,"Purchased this for my adult son who has excess sweating; he was so grateful; 'He was like Mom it really does work. thank you!'  Sometimes moms have to research products for adult children as they are where we were years ago. raising young children. working and just don't have the time to get helpful information that will solve their problems.  Anyway. it worked for him...Be sure that whom ever uses this product. that the directions are read carefully as it is not to be used like a deodorant.1. Use at night before bed (do this twice in a row)2. Then use every other nightDon't quote me verbatim. just read the direction for yourself before using. as I'm sure you would like to get the best use from this product.  If it does not work for you see your physician for a stronger version of this product...Good Luck!"
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
1,"I've spent soooooo much money on other products that never helped me :(This actually works!!! I was actually checking in the mirror through out the day to see if I found any sweat & it was completely dry. even after being outside & sweating my underarm area was DrY!!!!! It's watery when putting it on but dries pretty fast & may itch a little at first but it goes away. Trust me if you have embarrassing sweating arm pit stains on your shirt this is Worth it!!! Wish I would have know about it along time ago. But happy to finally find one that keeps me DRY!!! :)"
1,"I saw a TV commercial for this. I thought it wouldn't work so I got it from Walmart so I could easily take it back if it didn't.  IT WORKED.  Now I'm getting it from Amazon after this bottle runs out.It's not that it hides odor any better. it's that it stops wetness better.It's no secret about the aluminum ingredients.  The only thing keeping the mainstream deodorant makers form using the same ingredients is controversy over the effects of aluminum absorption into the system."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
1,"Works but hurts and itches like crazy when you put it on after shaving.  I purchased for wedding as this issue was a big concern for me.  Shaved on Thursday pm in preparation for rehearsal dinner on Friday (since I knew I wouldn't have time to shave on Friday with a huge to-do list). used deodorant on Friday night prior to wedding day.  However. still used another light layer of different kind (a roll-on) over it and had no issues whatsoever the next day.  No. wiping off on his tux or anything.  This was all a HUGE concern of mine too. Everything went perfectly and I didn't have to think about if I smelled or anything at all that day."
1,"1. I was scared that it would sting so badly. and no it's totally bearable and it will go away in a matter of few minutes.2. I once used it all over my body (pits. back. chest). and that was a hot day! And I did sweat a bit. but 90-95% of the sweats were eliminated.NOTE: DON'T use it on large area. not only it will sting really bad the night you apply it. the next day whenever your body trying to sweat it will sting too! BUT if you just use it for underarm alone. everything's fine.3. It lasts for approx. 2-3 days before you'll have to reapply it. Once I used a lot (and by a lot I mean A LOT). it stayed effective for over 5 days!!!4. Instead of rolling it directly to your underarm. you should roll it on your palm. and apply it with your palm so that it won't drip."
1,"If you have profuse sweating problems. thank the lord. because your problems are over. One swath of this under each arm and you can kiss those sweat rings good-bye. Ok. you won't want to do that. but if you have had that problem for as many years as I have. you may actually do it.The bottle says to use only on underarms. I advise that you follow that. However. I put some on my forehead every couple of days to keep those bothersome sweat beads out of my eyes (I wish I had bushy eyebrows). I have noticed an increase in perspiration on other parts of my body. especially while sleeping. but that is a small price to pay for the benefits."
1,"This is an amazing product. I've went through multiple brands. even tried all sorts of Secret. but nothing worked for me. I don't usually sweat unless I'm nervous. After trying Certain Dri Roll-On. I got rid of everything else I had. This thing is amazing. and you do not need to use it daily. Just apply once every 4-6 days depending on how often you need it. I apply it about once a week. It dries quickly and leaves no stains. Be sure NOT to use it after you have shaven or if you have extra sensitive skin as it could irritate. You can use the solid version if you have sensitive skin. Don't forget to get the A.M. Certain Dri as it gives a refreshing smell for the morning."
1,"For years now. I pretty much had to stick to black shirts since I sweat so much.  A quick Google search turned me on to Certain Dri. so I bought some and gave it a whack.  I put it on every night for 3 nights in a row.  Now I only put it on every 2 or 3 nights. and I have been getting great results!  I switched from using your standard antiperspirants. to a combination of this and regular deodorant.  My white undershirts aren't suffering from the nasty yellow pit-stains that normal antiperspirants cause. and I'm able to wear other shirts now without worrying about having wet armpits. We've had a hot May. and so far June here in Detroit...  I've only had minimal issues with sweat. even when it hits the upper 80's and 90's!  This stuff also seems to work well. even when working out or running!"
1,"Finally. a solution to damp pits!  I previously had horrendous sweating. and had to change anti-perspirants almost weekly.  Nothing had ever worked.  Now. I can put this on once a week. and use my regular stuff daily.  It actually works. and I haven't had a single instance of wet pits since I started using it.  I'm blown away that it took me so long to find this!It does sting a bit at night when you apply it. but it is absolutely worth it for the results."
1,"Tried it for a week and it did nothing. Followed the directions exactly...nothing. Tried applying twice a day...nothing. By the third day I was getting severe irritation. By the fourth day I had what looked like abrasive burns under my arms. This was all with following the direction and then. when it didn't work. the suggestions given by other users of the product such as waiting until fully dry after a shower. only applying before bed as per the directions. applying lightly the first time and more the second application the next night. etc. etc. etc.. I didn't get any noticeable reduction in sweating and now I have chafed pits. Moving on to another product."
1,"If you're looking for a product that is both inexpensive and works well. this is it. It does exactly what it says it does.It's sort of a longer term solution. If you put it on at night it'll last for up to 72 hours. but for me usually wears off around the second day. Put it on every night. you'll never have a problem with sweating.This isn't scented. so if you're looking for scented stuff- you can use something else to put on in the mornings. This strictly only stops the sweating. and it's good at doing it."
1,"I love Certain Dri. I'm not sure I could get along in life without it. When I first started using Certain Dri over a decade ago. I would use it every day. Then. I dropped down to using it every other day after maybe two or three weeks. Now. I feel I only need to give my underarms a few swipes once a week. This is incredible because I used to sweat like a beast. I mean. just sitting down without moving around would make my underarms sweat profusely. Gross. I don't worry about that anymore. I do wish that the product worked on hands. though. I haven't had any success trying to get it to work on my hands. However. that's not how the product is marketed. It is just wishful thinking."
1,"Skip all those &#34;clinical strength&#34; products that are sold by big name brands and just buy this!Certain Dri has helped me SO much. I don't think I could live without it! Ever since middle school I've had problems with underarm perspiration. but not anymore. I've been using this for maybe 8 years now. I used to apply it every singe night before bed. but now I use it about once every other week and its still working! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering. even if you haven't shaved your underarms. it's so uncomfortable and itchy!I really can't express how much I love this. Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida. my underarms are still dry!"
1,"I work out fairly often and have a pretty good physique. I like to wherefairly tight shirts. Before I started using Certain Dri. I generally had to where baggier shirts for fear of wetness. Now I can where them as tight as I want. This stuff is awesome. I put it on every 2nd or 3rd night. On occasion it will itch a little if I put to much on. but not near enough for me to stop using it. I certainly don't recommend using it every night. It wasn't meant to be used that often."
1,"I oversweat notoriously and embarrassingly. none of the OTC products quite cut it and make me go out in confidence. and about 70% of them give me rashes to boot. and Certain Dri proved to be a game-changer.1) It does NOT stop underarm sweating altogether. at least for me. but reduces it so dramatically that your underarms end up staying a lot drier than the rest of your body (sth  I def. Prefer)2) Doesn't cause underarm stains if applied correctly* (read sparingly).3) SAFE on oversensitive skin. again. if applied correctly*.*If you're worried you might've overapplied it. simply wait 30 mins after applying. then using a slightly wet tissue/paper towel. wipe the area application. once. This should clean any excess amount away. and don't worry; it will still work."
1,"I am profuse back sweater and had been using Sweatblock pads with great relief.  However. I wanted to find something easier to apply at less cost.  I assumed since the ingredients were the same that Certain Dri would do the trick.  And it has lots of great reviews.  It's been somewhat of a disappointment.  While I can tell it does prevent some sweating. it doesn't keep me dry to the same extent Sweat block did.  I'll try it a little longer because of the price. but it doesn't do the trick as I had hoped."
1,"The temperature hits one degree above 70 and I sweat like a pig. I drink gallons of water a day.  Thankfully my partner doesn't complain.  Her only complaint is body odor. aka pit stench.  Guess what? If there is no sweat there will be no haven for bacteria and hence no odor. This product works very well for me and has been a godsend.  Now my arm pits are always bone dry.  A little too dry actually.  I usually use a gentle skin lotion in place of daily deodorant.  No complaints from me. my partner or my coworkers.That being said this agitates my sensitive skin a little.  Using every other day helps alleviate that. but it's a worthy price to pay to avoid smelling like a dump and having gross stains all over my expensive shirts."
1,"I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I'd jump into a definite conclusion. I've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now. I bought it at a local pharmacy. wasn't cheap. I followed the instructions and I gotta say that it only helped for the first few applications. After that I started having irritation. itching. skin staining. clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working. But that didn't do it. I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant. Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem. Won't buy it again. it's just wasting money."
1,"I've recently started feeling the affects of lactose intolerance and it has put a serious damper on my food experiences. Most of the time I just go without any lactase supplements and risk the small amounts of dairy that comes with the meal. However. when I go for lattes or cheesecake I practically inhale these. They work amazingly quickly. allowing you to take two and just have at it right away.I'm also a bit self conscious about my intolerance. These are individually packed and come in pretty small wrappings. I hide some in my pocket for those days out and if I ever need some I can just turn around and quickly take a few. Very convenient and very effecti...OMGBRB ICE CREAM TRUCK!"
1,"I have severe lactose intolerance (not an allergy. 'just' intolerant) and I usually use the 'Ultra' form of this product. However. since I used to be okay with the 'Original' strength Lactaid. I thought this might be more economical. even if I had to take multiple tablets. I was wrong. For some reason. these tablets just didn't work for me. even when I took 3 or 4 tablets for something that would be managed by a single 'Ultra' tablet.So. if you are really sensitive to dairy products. then you're better off with 'Ultra' Lactaid. rather than 'Original' Lactaid."
1,"The lactaid product is wonderful for anyone that is lactose intolerant. The lactase supplement helps greatly. But go with the tablets. I bought a box of the chewables. and they are terrible. I take them now just because I paid for a box and want to get my money's worth. And once I finish this box. I will always go with the tabs. Granted. ther are more convenient in a place without water... but at the same time. when would you be eating without any liquid to take it down with? Stick to the tabs. you'll be happier."
1,"man! i wish i knew about this when i was younger! I never knew that there were pills about this to help with lactose intolerance... do you guys know how much i suffered bc of milk when i was young? all that diarrhea? it sucked! One day I was like hmmm what if there are pills we can take for lactose intolerance? And there was! I was eager to try it. I'm partly lactose intolerant and It's not that severe. I only get diarrhea when I eat a lot of dairy but ti's not too bad. I take this whenever I drink milk and it does work. I don't get diarrhea like I use to. Now of course this might not work for you bc everyones body response differently to pills."
1,"Lactose intolerance can be very stressful to deal with. Having to decline food. opportunities to eat because you can't digest is embarrassing and annoying. This solves the problem. Take one with your first bite and you can eat dairy products. It says take another after 45 mins but to be safe I would take it 30 mins after if you continue to eat dairy products.I prefer these to the chewables because I can fit a few in my wallet.If you have an empty stomach. be careful when eating lactose containing foods and drinking lots of liquids at the same time. That is the only time I've ever had issues. I took a bite of bagel with cream cheese and a Lactaid and then chugged a bottle of water. needless to say the Lactaid wasn't able to work very well in my empty stomach filled with water and a bit of cream cheese. my stomach was very upset.I drink the Lactaid milk all the time as well - I really like the whole milk.Great products."
1,"I love ice cream & other dairy products but unfortunately. these pills are the only way I can enjoy them.I've also been recently diagnosed w/ extreme iron overload (I guess having steak everyday for lunch & dinner wasn't a good thing :)). So. now I try to drink milk w/ every meal (esp. if meat is involved). At home. it's no problem since I have access to Lactose-free milk. but at restaurants. you don't have that option so Lactaid pills to the rescue!"
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
1,"The National Brand of the best working Lactase Tablets - they get the job done--i.e. preventing embarassing dashes for the nearest lavatory. which can be a pain if you're taking the train. particularly as it tends to be rather drafty in there and on cold mornings any trip where one has to run down a long series of connecting cars just to partially disrobe to read a newspaper and pretend that's all you went there for- which allows you to be comfortable and not have to make the weaving sway-bumping into others -as you fairly leap down the cars to the necessary--only to find it &#34;occupied&#34; - is a good thing to have on hand to use instead- make sure you take it WITH the dairy product - not after and not more than 1 minute before eating ...(heed my advice on this -or- don't say i didn't warn you)."
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
1,"I'm lucky. these are 'cheap' and work great for me; I eat a lot of dairy!I usually eat between one and three with my first bites of dairy. occasionally I've made a mistake and taken after. never have had a problem. knock on wood -funny thing. I live on a dairy farm. and I can drink our raw milk just fine. I need lactaid to eat our aged cheeses and pasteurized milk. I have not tried raw milk ice cream. and our yogurt is fine for me. all yogurt is fine for me ...I'm delighted I can buy this through Amazon. hard to get locally ..."
1,"These Lactaid tablets work well to prevent lactose intolerance induced disasters. The tablets are packaged in a way that is easy to carry around in your bag. pocket or other portable methods.I can finally enjoy foods with dairy again. I suggest taking one right before your first bite of foods with dairy and then having another in the middle of eating dairy if it is a good amount of food or you have been eating for a while. I'm very cautious so I like to be on the safe side I guess.The tablets are composed of lactase. a naturally made enzyme that people with lactose intolerance lack. so there shouldn't be any side effects to taking 'too many' tablets. I would just use common sense and experiment with how many tablets to take when eating various dairy products."
1,"I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead:[...]Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product."
1,"I suffer with very very dry eyes. They sting a lot and I frequently have to put drops in them. Recently the drops just weren't doing it for me anymore.... felt like someone glued my eyelids open and sat me in front of an industrialized heavy duty fan. I had to take frequent naps daily just to help with my stinging dry eyes. I got headaches when I read or stared at the computer too long cause of persistent stinging. For my 'Dry eye syndrome' this is the FIRST and ONLY product that has really helped. My eyes are no longer red. They do not burn. they do not dry out quickly.I still use liquid drops but maybe only once of twice daily and this is only because I am afraid my eyes dry out again.This product is worth the money and I highly recommend it."
1,"This sterile eyewash helps my dogs with his dry eye.  Once a friend was putting it in. I asked why do you do that? she said her eye itches ... so I keep a watch on my Westie. Marco Polo and wipe away his 'goop' and use the wash.  I used to use specific drops for dry eye ... but this has the same effect.It's a large bottle that you just tip. don't squeeze and the drop comes out.  Great price compared to the tiny ones."
1,"I have had problems recently with dry eyes (horribly blood shot eyes at one point). I tried a couple brands of eye drops and another recommended by my eye doctor but none provided any real relief. But. this does - yea! Also. good to have on hand for an emergency. I can't fully open my eyes working to keep the small included eye cup from leaking (which it does anyway). So. I looked into buying a larger eye cup. TheEye Wash Cup 1 Countis perfect. It is curved. slightly smaller. is easier to hold. doesn't bend. and so doesn't leak - a highly recommended addition."
1,"The single-use container version (no preservative) of Thera Tears is the only one that gives my dry eyes relief. and I've been using this product for years.  I've tried other products. which irritate my eyes rather than soothe them.  More important to me than the applicator design is the availability and pricing of the single-use container version.  Unfortunately. Walmart and Target (whose pricing was great at only $8.58 per box) recently stopped selling the boxes of single-use containers in their stores.  So. now I'm researching new sources for best pricing and availability."
1,"I've had severe dry eye for 6+years now. I've used preservative-free thera tears this whole time. They started out with a sturdy little vial that had a resealable tip. Now they've extended the tip with a long 'neck'. When I open the vial it is sometimes still sealed shut. Other times it just squirts everywhere. It's such a waste. Many people are complaining but Advance Research isn't doing a thing about it. I guess we need to log more complaints. E-mail address: info@theratears.com"
1,"I have been using another. more viscous. product for quite some time for dry eye. I tried this and liked it as something to use in between. because it is thin enough. it does not blur my vision. However. it is too thin for much protection now that the heat is on in the house. so I use both. alternating them. I have a bone to pick with the makers. though. They designed the little containers (this is preservative free single containers) with a funny grip that often blocks the liquid from coming out. which is very frustrating and not good for use while driving."
1,"I've used TheraTears for years in these handy vials but recently have not been able to find them in the stores. (The vials are far superior to the bottles that contain preservatives that irritate my eyes.) So I was delighted to find them on Amazon and ordered several boxes. They came without the box. just foil packs of vials thrown into a shipping box. Without the individual box there is no way to verify their expiration date. (I'm guessing they were expired or close to it.). I contacted the seller the same day. They sent me a return label WITHOUT the postage paid. I had to pay close to $7.00 to return them. Don't buy these from the First Aid Company."
1,"We buy these for my 89-year-old mother.  It is so much easier than having a little bottle that she cannot get the top off of.We buy them on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away (besides. the prices are up to 40% higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours. why go anywhere else?)Anyway. these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent."
1,"I bought these for my infant's first trip to Hawaii. I was freaking out about the plane and travel and yada yada... My daughter was 8 months when I used these but she's bigger than the &#34;typical&#34; 8 month old and these fit her ears fine. She was about 19# when we went to give a reference. She didn't have any trouble taking off or landing. These provide an amount of buffering to noise. similar to a regular ear plug. and this helped while we were on a prop (hopper) plane and to the regular noises of flying. I ended up buying 5 pairs to have on hand. Through the round trip of 4 legs. I used all 5 pairs since 1 fell out into the Netherlands of the airplane floor."
1,"I bought these to try out when I am in public since I suffer from near deafness in one ear and hyperacousis in the other (the body tries to compensate for a loss of one of the senses).  I cannot tolerate noisy restaurants and loud venues like Costco.  These are rubbery tubes surrounded by a spiral (screw-like) rubber.  You can place them into your ear canal and twist to seat them well.  The rubber tubes allow air to escape due to changes in air pressure so your ears do not need to pop.  I cannot use them easily since they still do not fit my abnormally narrow ear canals despite the fact that I am an adult.  Still. I can manage to make them stay for a short time by twisting and twisting and it will help if I am exposed to a loud venue and have difficulty tolerating it."
1,"The reason for this is because of the design. Instead of having a tapered curved sleeve style plug similar to the Etymotic ER20s. these have sharp ridges stab into your ear canal. They feel soft to the finger but in actuality apply more pressure on the ear canal than the standard sleeved style ear plug.  There are four ridges that taper in size and they really do push out on the ear canal as you push them into your ear.  It hurts like crazy.  Curved sleeve tapered earplugs. those ones lay against your ear canal and distribute the pressure across more ear canal surface.  With these all the pressure reside along these sharp ridges.I'm very disappointed in these. I thought they were sized for kids (which they are). they  seem to hurt more .  I know earholes differ greatly from person to person. Mine happen to be about 3/16th of an inch in diameter.  I really can't see any child wearing these comfortably. much less an adult with tiny earholes like myself."
1,"I bought FRER pregnancy tests after two years of using the cheaper Wondfu tests on amazon. I loved the wondfu tests and  left excellent feedback but my third batch I got false positives which was. obviously. heartbreaking. I decided to spend more money and buy these tests instead. Well I got my BFP today and confirmed with a digital EPT brand test as well.  I'm 13 DPO and my period was due in 1-2 days. I did test earlier with these pregnancy tests and all tests were negative until today!! I recommend these tests - accurate and quick/clear results."
1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
1,"I used these exclusively with my first two pregnancies.  Fortunately. it did not take us long to get pregnant. so I did not end up forking over more than the price of one package each time.  For my third (and current) pregnancy. in an effort to save money. I bought the Wondfo tests. and purchased the FRER to confirm the positives that I got from the Wondfo.  Wondfo detected the pregnancy at 9 DPO (6 days before my expected period). and did a good job at tracking the subsequent hormone build-up.  I can't imagine spending the money on FRER if it takes repeated attempts to get pregnant. when there are so many cheaper alternatives out there.  That said. I trust FRER's results. which is why I bought it to confirm the Wondfo results.  As I am rating the product itself (and not the price). It gets 5 stars."
1,"I used First Response for all 3 of my pregnancies. They give you accurate results and early. I just found out I am pregnant with my third and I haven't even missed my period yet. I used the First Response ovulation predictor last month and I had a feeling it was a success. I used 2 of these on Friday the 10th and Saturday the 11th. got 2 lines on both. My conception date was May 31st. Granted I know it's early and things can happen. but the point here is that this pregnancy test gave me accurate results and very early. And everyone knows. false positives are almost impossible. I highly recommend these!!"
1,"I ordered these as they are a whole lot cheaper than what they sell in the stores. 3 tests for 11 bucks?! I&#8217;ll take it. They shipped super quick to me which is another plus. The best thing though? I took this test at around 11dpo. Got a faint positive. I went to the lab the next day to get my blood drawn. Came back negative. This test was able to catch a positive before the lab&#8217;s levels could. It was only a qualitative so I don&#8217;t know what exactly my levels were. had to have been lower than 20miu(the lab&#8217;s levels). Had to go back the next week and of course. got a positive. So I&#8217;m pretty impressed with these tests."
1,"It's a shame First Response makes you think your result is accurate 4 days before your period. It is very. VERY rare to be able to get your reading that early.You simply do not have enough hgc in your blood for an at-home test to pick up.From my research. these FRER's are very accurate...but you have to wait til at LEAST 12-14DPO. And this is based on a perfect 28 day cycle with O at CD14research show s Dollar Store tests are also accurate but less sensitive. I would load up on dollar store tests then use these for final proof!Go to fertilityfriend.com and get the proof there that you will probably test negative until about a day before your period."
1,"I was Eager. so I took this test 4 days before we could start saying I'd missed or was late...The faintest of faint lines appeared... a line. is a line and it was a positive line!  My husband was skeptical... so I waited 2 days and took another one... the line was VERY CLEARLY there this time... and we were pregnant. For fun. we tried other leading brands that can detect early... and got a 'Not Pregnant' indicator... so... in my books. First response. is about as FIRST response as you  get... b/c we were infact pregnant :)Goodluck!!!"
1,"I bought this on a whim since I was one day late and my body is like clockwork. Imagine my shock when I took two test and one came out positive and the other negative. I was hyperventilating. We were safe but things happen - condoms are not 100% and I was off my pill due to how ill it made me. I made a doc's appointment for blood work and we found out I was never pregnant.... Happy ending - yes. But we are still traumatized. if this was an accurate test a lot of stress could have been avoided."
1,"First. the instructions to use your first morning urine are bad--it's best to test in the evening. If your cycles vary. there aren't enough tests to ensure you catch your surge. I never got a positive on these. and after testing with Wondfo strips (that provide more tests). I came to realize I ovulate later in my cycle. I never would have realized this on these strips. and I probably would have stuck to my initial fear (that I wasn't ovulating) if I had stayed with this brand."
1,"After using and ovulation test for 4 months as well as BBT charting. we went to the Dr. and when I explained to him that my chart &#34;looked&#34; like I had ovulated but my ovulation kit had never turned. He said it was very apparent that I was ovulating and that I needed to use a better quality ovulation kit. I bought this one over the cheaper ones I had been using and it's true. Personally. I would recommend charting first to get an idea of when to ov. test and then only test on the days that are close. These tests say start on day 10 but I don't ovulate until day 18 usually so I don't even bother now until day 14 in my cycle. If you want to save money. I would recommend using these on your &#34;most likely to Ovulate&#34; days and use the cheap ones on the other days."
1,"The first month of trying to get pregnant I used a more expensive clear blue digital test which didn't work properly as I kept getting errors of all sorts. I then got a cheap drug store brand which apparently didn't work either. I immediately ordered this for my next cycle. it was simple and easy to use. After my first try with it. I'm now 8 weeks pregnant. So what can I say. it works.Update 21/10/2013I'm sure it works!My son is now three years old so my husband and I decided we were ready to try again. So of course I turned to first response again. I bought a pack of these and used it for two cycles. They are pretty good so I was able to stretch it over two cycles. and to my surprise I'm pregnant again using these tests after two months."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
1,"Never got a positive reading with these opks. even though I did with wondfos. and I had a clear rise in BBTs for the four days following the positive reading with wondfo.  These are ridiculously priced compared to wondfos ($2.43 per test versus .40) and didn't work for me!  I would have missed my LH surge if I hadn't also tested with wondfos.  Can't recommend these based on my results.  I highly recommend wondfo opks.Update: Tried using these again this cycle. Clearblue Advanced showed a solid smiley (peak fertility) and wondfo showed a strong positive (test line was darker than the control).  FR still shows a negative. FR apparently isn't very sensitive.  While I think CBs are expensive. they do work far better than FRs for me.  I would have missed 2 LH surges if I'd solely relied on the FRs."
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
1,"I already raved somewhere about these.... they are JUST AMAZING and so far can't seem to find anything betterdon't like pills so these are very thin and compared to regular ones are night and day and they don't smell after like Trojans...you get used to how they look...but again. we disagree on the smell. I don't smell them but my other half does.these are the best we've tried so far! just amazing! ....they're hard to open but totally worth the price and the effort. He loves them. definately the best out there that we've tried. They're not slimy....will order again!"
1,"Pros: I hate condoms. and I love these. They are a little weird when you first open them up. if you don't know what to expect. Honestly. the smell is pleasant. and reminds me of kind of a leathery fruity woodsy smell. They are a little roomy when they get warmed up. which adds to the feeling of there not being anything there. For a while. I was just certain they would break at any moment because I figured an animal membrane couldn't possibly be that strong. but they are super tough. Fill one up with water and you will see what I'm talking about. I went off hormonal birth control a while ago. and have been using these instead. Again. they don't protect against STDs and should not be used by anyone but monogamous couples. Best condoms ever!Con: expensive. but I honestly would pay more for them if I had to."
1,"I cut myself rather nastily at a friend's house and he gave me one of these.  They seal tightly and absorb blood and fluids to allow natural healing.  You just put the bandage on and leave it; no changing dressings.  Although they're expensive on a per-each basis. because you don't change dressings. they may be less expensive than fabric or plastic bandages per injury.  I bought some for car. home. and suitcase. so I'll have one wherever I might need it."
1,"It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack. but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid. I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone. these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages. Flexible Fabric. 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
1,"While there is nothing wrong with the product. I am APPALLED by the magnitude of over-pricing on Band-Aid branded bandages. I am not blaming the retailers. I have also noticed that Band-Aid seems to be &#34;eliminating&#34; competing generic offerings. especially if they are in similarly sized boxes.Right after I received this I found packages of generic bandages with 100 total strips of assorted sizes at Walmart for 88 cents. That's $0.88! I checked several Walmarts BEFORE I ordered Band-Aid. but there was no better generic offerings. it was only AFTER ordering that I found them.Nonetheless. I don't have a &#34;good reason&#34; to return these (oh. I would. if I could. but it's not the seller's fault. so I don't want to make them take losses on S&H;). but I will be avoiding Band-Aid brand with even more resolve now."
1,"I have an irritated spot on my face where my CPAP mask presses too hard. and no matter how I adjust it. it still gouges that spot. Band-Aid Clear Spots help a lot. and I use a fresh one every night. The Clear Spots are also very helpful for little cuts and scrapes where a regular-sized Band-Aid would be overkill. I've been buying these in a local pharmacy. but when I saw the 3-pack (150 total) for only a couple of dollars more than I was paying for one box of 50 at the pharmacy. I was sold.The Clear Spots are a very helpful product at a very reasonable price. and I'm very pleased with the deal."
1,"First of all. let me say that whenever I tried a brand other than 'Band-aid' I was disappointed.  That said. I believe this particular style is the best I have found.  When I was having a lot of trouble with eczema on my right hand. I needed to wear band-aids on two of my fingers. to protect them so they would heal.  All the other bandaids either had fabric that began to unravel almost immediately or the cushion area was too small or the length of the bandaid was too short.  This one is just right. The whole bandaid is 2 7/8 inches long.  The cushion part is a quilted 1 inch by 1 inch square and has a nice thickness to it.  Also. the actual fabric of the bandaid is a sort of rubber-plastic. so it does not unravel and it stays on pretty well.  It is water resistant.  Buy this one for your general use.  You will probably save money in the long run."
1,"I couldn't bring myself to count all 280 bandages in each of the two packs of Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages I ordered. but I did confirm that all stated sizes were in each box in what appears to be the correct distribution. This is a heck of a lot of bandages. but I have two sons and I like to be prepared. I will re-stock our auto and personal first aid kits from these large boxes as needed. I did not carefully compare prices for these. and I suspect a local Costco or BJ's might have better per-bandage prices. but this was a painless way to stock my medicine chest."
1,"First. you don't buy specialized bandages like this very often. I think the last pack lasted well over five years.But these new ones. yikes! The adhesive - able to stick for days (thru showers). the breathe-ability of the flexible and comfortable material. the ability of this tiny bandaid to apply pressure when needed. Latex-free and hypoallergenic (I've had bad reactions to the adhesive in bandaids. not just the latex). This stuff blows away other (more recent) models of bandaids in my medicine cabinet.It reminds me more of surgical tape with a gauze pad fixed to it. Except my surgical tape isn't this quality.Where can I find this stuff in other sizes?"
1,"With our large family and all of us doing lots of sports - ok. the kids do sports and I'm just a klutz - I like to keep a large assortment of bandages in the medicine cabinet.  I like this huge 280 count box because it has some of every size in one place.  Having a separate box for each type of bandage takes a lot of space.  Most of these are the plastic kind. although it does contain some of the fabric kind. We don't use many of the little tiny square ones. but they're nice to have on hand for blisters or small cuts.  The biggest ones are perfect for knee or elbow scrapes.  The fabric ones are perfect for fingers. since the bandage is tougher.Bandaid bandages stay put on the injury. unlike some of the cheaper ones I've bought.  Every medicine cabinet should have one of these boxes. ready for any emergency."
1,"I gave this product one star because I didn't even have the chance to really test it's effectiveness because it started coming off the same day I put it on. I followed all the directions. washed and dried the affected area. etc. etc. My blister was on my hand. while most other people seem to have them on their feet from running.The directions clearly show that it can be applied to your hand (actually their illustration showed the product being applied in the exact same spot I had mine). Well it stayed on for a while until I had to wash my hands and then it just started peeling off.The product says it can get wet and is made to stay on. Don't get me started on the cost of these either. Regardless of which option you chose. your paying at least 80 cents per cushion. That's a rip off. You could purchase 40 band aids for that price. use some neosporin and replace them each day. Much cheaper.Would not recommend."
1,"We never seem to have Bandaids around when we needed them so I ordered these. They arrived quickly and contain lots and lots of Bandaids. They are of the no frills variety. meaning your traditional old-school Bandaid. No flexible fiber bands or anything. There are tons of bandaids in here. All sizes and shapes. Great if you have kids who often get hurt. or if you are accident prone. You'll always have a Bandaid in the house with this pack.Pros: Cheap.Lots and lots of Bandaids. all sizes and shapes.Cons: Very basic band-aids. not very sticky."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
1,"I bought these after having a tooth pulled that would not stop bleeding. I'm by no means an expert on gauze pads so I won't speak to quality etc. I bought the smallest size which was 2x2 inches. If you are having a tooth pulled and want to have some on hand I can recommend these. I did find I had to cut them half in order not cause my 'gag' reflex to come into play. This may have been because of all the stuff the oral surgeon had stuffed into my mouth and my brain may have had it!  Anyhow. these fit nicely into the back of your mouth when cut in half. I'm sure since I have three grandchildren under 7 that the ones I didn't use will come in handy at some point too!"
1,"With my washing machine not working. I've been doing a lot of hand laundering. as well as washing dishes. (no dish washer either) My hands with dry Winter air and harsh indoor heating have become crinkled. cracked and rough.I have a box of hand lotiona and creams and last evening applied this one just before going to bed.It helped very much.Upon awakening this morning. I nearly forgot how dry and parched they had been because they feel so nice and soft.I'll be using this every night before bed until my skin heals.Wonderful product for chapped. cracked hands."
1,"A family member had been suffering with lips so severely chapped that they would crack and bleed on a daily basis - the bottom lip looked like it was splitting in two.  This went on for several months.  After reading about this product. I purchased a tube:  within 24 hours. the pain was gone and the skin was starting to heal over.  Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed.  To say that we are shocked is an understatement. particularly when we read the ingredients. which appear to be primarily mineral oil and petroleum jelly.  This is a miracle in a tube. and we are not going to use any other chapped lip products.  Highly recommend this."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
1,"Folks. the 'active ingredient' in this crap is Petrolatum - basically. that's Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.  And this junk contains 41% of it.  Regular Vasoline Petroleum Jelly contains 100%.  At less than 1/3 the price.  So if you want to spent $6.00 on this vs. $1.50 on a Vasoline. please don't let me stop you. but I'm simply telling you basic science.  The 'inactive' ingredients include mineral oil and glycerin.This concoction is why pharmaceutical companies are despised around the world.  Take $0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly. throw in $0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin. and tout it as 'Advanced Therapy'.It's B.S. folks - pure and simple.  Junk.Save yourselves some money and do yourselves a favor - but the cheapest Petroleum Jelly you can find; Vaseline or store brand."
1,"I bought this product because I saw that there were 62 5 star reviews and almost no bad ones. A mistake. I should have read the ingredients more carefully before buying. I should have read them at all.As soon as I squeezed some out of the tube I realized it was mostly petroleum jelly. I looked at the ingredients and. sure enough. active ingredient was 41% petrolatum.THAT'S VASELINE!So. if you want greasy hands and nothing else works. maybe this is for you. But I don't. and am somewhat disappointed I didn't read the description more carefully and bought based on all the great reviews. Caveat Emptor."
1,"I discovered Aquaphor when a dear friend went on Accutane. She was in misery because her lips were so dry. Her doctor gave her some Aquaphor samples. I had thought it was only for body skin but I was very wrong. This thick. rich product soothed her lips and the dryness and cracking were gone within a day.I picked up a tube and found it has a many uses. In addition to softening lips (which I use in rotation with another favorite Carmex) Aquaphor can be used on dry knees. elbows and heels. A tiny bit works well as an eye moisturizer and it also softens cuticles.Great product for a little price!"
1,"I have dry skin and when the weather gets dry and cold. my skin keeps coming off like a snake (I think it's a common problem that many people have). Before I used Olay Moisturizer + Sun Block and it worked. However. for some reasons. it stopped working for me. My doctor recommend this to me. I tried it and it worked really well. My skin stays moisturized for the whole day. The best thing about this product is I don't have to use it everyday. I apply it on my face in the morning. wash it off by the afternoon. and my skin stays moisturize for the next 3-5 days. The only draw back is the product is waxy. When I apply it on my face. it looks like I just cover it with oil. Yes. shine. oily looking. However. if you don't care too much about your appearance. it is a perfect solution for your dry skin. Oh. did I mention that the price is very reasonable?"
1,"Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I've ever used!  I'm on Retin-A. and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I'm dealing with right now and how you're not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I've used the other $100 jars of worthlessness. and believe me. this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However. some things you do need to consider before buying:This is quite greasy. therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding's....It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I'm not complaining."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
1,"I have used this for years to combat dry skin on my face. Here is why I like it:1. It goes on clear and works very effectively to moisturize dry skin.2. It penetrates quickly. so I can wipe it off in a couple of minutes in order to avoid having a &#34;shiny&#34; looking face. but still have moisturized skin.3. It is more soothing and less greasy than vaseline.4. Unlike various facial moisturizers. it is fragrance free. so you don't have any smell after using this.5. This tube is a convenient size for travel and also to keep in the office.Bottom line: I have tried countless ointments over the years because I have always had dry skin. and this is the best one that I have found.Shop for price. I buy this for less at my local CVS than the price on Amazon."
1,"I suffer from HS and bought it for this. This is great for itches as well. It numbs the area so you can forget about it. i.e. mosquito bite. etc. I also use it for my edges. After I got my hair braided it was tight and annoying and I am using it for a few days until my hair loosens a bit. I will also use if for my eyebrows when I pluck. Apply first. leave for a few minutes. then wipe. The product should have numbed the area long enough and makes tweezing/waxing less painful. I will buy many times."
1,"After years of having toe nails that grow oddly while at the same time toe nails that would turn almost black . I started using this medication. Even after a just-a few weeks I have noticed a great change and would not be without it. My toes nails re now growing with a distinctive clear color rather than black and they are beginning to take a normal shape instead of the one-fourth inch thick toe nail I used to have. It is still too early to tell if the medication is going to completely clear up the fungi. however it appears it is working quite well."
1,"I used a different product that is Acetone based so it dried & disappeared. leaving just the medicine in place. I like it still but thought a different product might be good so the fungus doesn't get immune to it. As you might know. there is NO cure for nail fungus. not even by prescription. you can only control it.  This product here is an oil. think what it can do to your socks or if any of it gets on carpeting etc. Also my nails started getting a dark cast to the top of the nails where this was applied. This product is no good."
1,"If your going to try it and it has a applicator brush in it too . I bought the pen and it lasted about 6 weeks . Tea tree oil is really the best stuff . I am making some progress using both and planning to try kerasil or the vics vapo rub next if this doesn't clear it up after 6 months . It cleaned my little toes quick but my big toes just won't clear up . They look better but stay yellow - not gross anymore but slight greenish yellow . Getting old is no fun and either is using a dirty shower in a truck stop . Been paying for one slip in doing that for 25 years now but I treat it daily and know I won't do the same to someone else ."
1,"This is the only thing I've used that has helped the fungal infection of my big toenail (which I've had for 5 or 6 years). I use it twice a day in conjunction with Fungisoap and within a few weeks I saw improvement. My nail is no longer thick and dark. and while the infection is visibly still present. it looks much better than it did a month or two ago. I cut my nail down as far as I can and keep it filed down so I can apply this liquid under the nail as well. Right now it looks like my nail may fall off (sorry if this is TMI). but I'm hoping like others here that will mean I can continue to use this stuff on the skin under my nail. I'll update this review as time goes by."
1,"My nails and cuticles have been so dry and were looking just awful!  Some peeling of nails. but don't think it was fungus~just cold winter and using bleach to clean while at my daughter's house with no gloves.  Ran across a bottle of this stuff while looking for nail polish. remembered how it had cleared up a toe fungus years ago. and decided to try it on my nails. just to see if it would help.  WOWOWOWOWOW! You wouldn't believe the change in my cuticles and nails in the last 3 days!  Whatever is in this stuff is just really great for dry. peeling nails. with or without fungus. dry cuticles. and who knows what else! I may try it on other skin issues now.  GREAT stuff!"
1,"Bought this and Tea Tree Ultimates - Funga Soap for my wife. Both her big toes were gross and cloudy and cracking. Why it doesn't bother her more...I don't know. but I took it upon myself to buy her these two products.She started using them. and within a week or two...both nails fell out. It was super nasty...but I'm guessing both nails were so unhealthy. they probably would have come out regardless.Over the last 6 months. they've been growing back. One of them looks great. but the other is cloudy. Why? Because she doesn't use the stuff I bought her. :)I can't say what the two products do individually...because she only used them together. For the price though. it's worth some of the more expensive options at the doctors office. But you have to be disciplined and actually put the stuff on!"
1,"Probably one of the world's best inventions. Vaseline.  But. this tube is just fantastic for babies.  We bought these for our newborn and it's just so much easier to use when you're putting it on the baby's belly button.  Plus. it's best for preventing diaper rash than anything else out there on the market.  When your hands are dry from washing them after EVERYTHING you do with the baby. the Vaseline comes to the rescue. This tube is a marvelous invention and the best sanitary-wise to use for a baby.  I keep one in my purse for my dry hands too.  Love this invention!"
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
1,"Every year my Lab (Maggie) gets some kind of contact dermatitis or allergy on her Neck. Not sure from what. This year I purchased the BFI and the Columbia Powder. I do remember as a kid I think my parents used the BFI. At that time it was in a little metal can. Anyway  I use them both and they worked great. Just can't say which one works best. They probably both work the same but I would lean towards the BFI because I remember it as a kid."
1,"This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy.  Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day.  I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I don't add more than the water required in the directions; a watery orange taste can be terrible so don't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I don't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me.  This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis."
1,"What can I say? Metemucil works. not only to prevent constipation but also to prevent the runs. Our GI doc actually prescribed it years ago to slow down the works.If you check the labels. Metamucil has more soluble fiber that any other supplement I could find. Cheaper too.Since we use one cannister almost monthly the subscribe & save is great. If you drink it in about 10 oz. water quickly. it does not get mushy. Just don't let it sit for any length of time.It is GF. has no MSG or related products or aspartates."
1,"This product contains way too much sugar for me. I just compared Metamucil (48.2 Oz Container) to Benefiber (18.7 Oz Container). and found the following:With Metamucil you get 114 servings per container.Serving Size: 12g (One rounded Tbsp)Calories Per Serving: 45Total Carb: 12gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 2gSugars: 9gIron: 0.8mgSodium: 5mgPotassium: 30With Benefiber you get 115 servings per container.Serving Size: 4.6g (Two Tsp)Calories Per Serving: 15Sodium: 0gTotal Carb: 4gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 3gSugar: 0gMetamucil is tasty but it gets too thick to drink if not consumed immediately. Benefiber is a little more expensive. but at least I'm not paying for sugar and putting on weight from the empty calories.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
1,"I'm glad that amazon carries this product because I can't find it in my area anymore. I've tried many pre-shave conditioners thru the years but this works best for me. I don't really like buying 12 of these at a time but the price is right and even buying 12 is still cheaper than buying just one of some of the other products I have tried. I will share this with my son and son-in-law who both use this product too. Thanks Amazon for keeping this available to us!"
1,"I have been buying this lotion for 6 years from my grocery store. Usually they cost $3-$4 each but now none of my grocery stores carry this anymore. I got this 12 pack for $26 and free shipping and you can't beat that anywhere. This lotion makes it so easy to use my electric shaver without any irritation and it glides with a close shave. Also you need next to very little after shave after using this because it has lotion built in and has a very subtle scent you can use a different after shave lotion or cologne without the 2 scents clashing."
1,"After using all types of eyebrow grooming wax to hold down my unruly brows. I had almost given up until I found this gem of a product.  My current eyebrow wax was a little too hard and unfortunately would yank out a few hairs with it.  In a last ditch attempt. I tried the clubman moustache wax in neutral.  Keep in mind that my eyebrow hairs are VERY unruly (and yes. I am a lady)and finding something that really works and has staying power had been difficult until now.  You only need the smallest amount on each brow because the product is very concentrated.  My eyebrow hairs stay in place all day and look better than they ever have.  I also like the fact that it dries clear and that there is no build up.  It also doesn't dry out my skin like other products.  Definitely a keeper!"
1,"I got this a few days ago and each day my handlebar looks better. It's like my mustache is learning to form a curl on both sides. This goes on soft and easy with very little work and then after about 15 to 30 seconds it sets and you have a very firm but still pliable hold. It has a very pleasant fresh scent that reminds me of grapefruit. It washes out very easily my one complaint is that the neutral shows up as white on my red stache and makes me look like i'm greying or have dried boogers unless I am very judicious in my use of the product. So until I find something else this is my go to with a light touch."
1,"This was actually the boyfriend's purchase since he wanted to try black (his hair is naturally black) instead of the clear which is all he can find in stores around here.His opinion was that clear is a lot better even though you have to work it in to make sure it doesn't show up because the black is too messy (i.e. it's black and tends to get on everything.)It'd probably be good if you wanted to darken your moustache/beard though.Aside from that he likes Clubman's and I have to say it makes his beard look much nicer...keeps his beard in control."
1,"The odor was too strong for me. It was a fruity sweet smell but it wasn't working for me.  I had to wash my moustache within five minutes because I couldn't stand it.Also the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it.  It was looking bad to me visually.It did hold the hairs into place for the brief time I used it.The only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush. Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection."
1,"My beard always grew in patchy and I tried a ton of things to fill it out. This wax is the best by far.It's good and thick. but you can add water if you'd like to thin it out. It has a tiny brush for pinpoint accuracy. It tends to get on your fingers. then anything you touch. but you can't blame black wax for that. You can only blame mother nature. And if you got a problem with mother nature. you got a problem with me.It can rub off. but a holding spray or spritzer can help it hold. My beard looks naturally fuller and i've gotten a ton of compliments from other beard enthusiasts."
1,"this wax is awesome. its soft and easy to apply it drys on clear and will hold my mustache for a good 10-15 hours without me having the fix it.only complaints are that sometimes it irritates my skin or drys it out. and the container it is in normally ends up getting damaged or a hole in it since its metal and will eventually just get a hole in it from squeezing or folding the tube. ussually happens to me when the tube is 50-75% gone but it will dry out inside the tube fast when it happens. Ive been through about 4 of these in a year and it happened to all of them."
1,"I've been alarmed by the reviews on various sellers' sites saying they had ordered cylindrical and received tapered. I ordered these in August and did receive cylindrical brush tips. as pictured. The wires are pretty weak. and easily bent. but that's unavoidable if it's going to fit into tight spaces. They're supposed to be changed weekly. and I can generally get a week's worth of use out of one. despite having some teeth that are both very close. and slightly crooked. so it's a guessing game inserting the wire at just the correct angle to slide right in.I use a Proxabrush with the conical tip at one end for wide spaces. and the cylindrical one at the other end."
1,"I use these with the Oral B interdental holder that my hygienist gave me. She originally gave me some of the WIDE interdental brushes which worked fine for larger gaps. but the #414 'Tight' works for more of my gaps. There are still a lot of spaces that these will not fit. so I recommend using regular floss as well as a Waterpik in conjunction with these interdental brushes. My normal routine is to floss. use the interdental in most spaces. then use a Waterpik. followed by an Oral B powered brush.Overall: 5/5 stars. as advertised - may not fit in the tightest gaps. but works for 90% of my teeth. I'd probably go with Moderate for a better fit in the larger gaps."
1,"I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal. and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums. and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit. it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea. but the others worked much. much better for me.  I would not recommend these."
1,"The 'tight' proxabrush refills are just what I wanted and ordered. They get into most of the small between teeth gaps that the larger brushes do not.My only problems with the tight ones is that the wire is so fine they don't last very long (and bend too easily) and there are still some teeth that tight are still too big to get between.I also ordered 'wide' only because I couldn't find 'extra-wide' on Amazon.For both sizes. the brushes eventually wear out - getting either shorter or come off the wire. but each one lasts at least a week for my use (daily)."
1,"I hate flossing but I do it anyway.  I actually should say. I &#34;hated&#34; flossing.  The time it takes annoys me and it seems like my gums still bled everytime anyway.  Now I floss. use this to stimulate my gums and then brush.  This tool is awesome.  My gums like it.  They aren't bleeding now and I get more out with this thing because it goes around the whole tooth not just in between.  I really like it a lot enough to use it every day. I actually look forward to using it.  My teeth feel really clean now."
1,"I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it's ease in purchasing. I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis. You run the rubber tip (point) between your teeth and gum line. The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove. The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth. Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results. When the rubber tip starts to curl. then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago. I also use daily a water pick as well. as prescribed also."
1,"We've used these for years but most recently. they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist. he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well."
1,"This is VERY durable; it hasn't broken in the months I've had it. (I forgot to write a review until now...).I had wanted a gum stimulator for quite some time. and I decided to buy this one. it was inexpensive. and it looked legit. Great product for a great price. I am a 100% pleased customer. When this one gets old or worn out (it still hasn't at all though!). I will definitely be purchasing this exact one again. (maybe from a drugstore. to avoid shipping costs. But still this product!)I also bought refills (replacement rubber tips) for when the tip gets worn.Note: For a while I was wondering why the rubber tip felt so hard and stiff... and nothing on the package said that you have to run it under hot water to soften it up before uses.. that. or I just didn't see it. Then again. it is sorta logical... but yeah. Run it under hot water to soften it. :D"
1,"With an angled head like a dental probe. the rubber tipped GUM Stimulator is a handy tool for stimulating the gums. and removing plaque from hard to get to areas. like behind the back teeth.  The sharp rubber tip works well in between teeth. and also along the gumline.  While it is recommended that the tip be heated before use to soften the rubber. it probably isn't necessary.  If the tip wears out or breaks. replacement tips are available.Controlling plaque is a lifelong challenge for most of us. and this is a very helpful tool in the battle.  Check your local drugstore for a better deal."
1,"The G-U-M stimulators do exactly what they should do - get the bad stuff out and away from around your teeth.  Even after brushing long and thoroughly. there is still stuff left under the gum rims. The G-U-M Stimulator tip removes the bad stuff without hurting your gums.The difficult part about the G-U-M stimlators is getting the rubber tips onto the metal handle.  It takes a lot of hand strength.  Moistening the tip with hot water helps. but it still takes a lot of hand strength.  The other downside is that a single stimulator is good for only about 3 or 4 uses - then the tip begins to break.  Time to wrestle a new tip onto the handle."
1,"Not much to say here. but I like when products I'm looking at have reviews.These are durable. good. effective... Basically. they are exactly what you want when you are looking for replacement tips for your gum stimulator. Also. they are inexpensive. I will definitely buy these again when I need more!Note: They may seem stiff at first. but you are supposed to run them under hot water to soften them before use. It took me a while to figure that out. I think it's on the package. but I don't remember.Anyways. good product. 5 stars!"
1,"These are great travel toothbrushes and I recommend them.  However; at the time I was updating my emergency kit and wanted to add a new compact toothbrush.  Not to take away from this great product - I found a better one right here on Amazon called the Wisp tooth brush.  They are one time use toothbrushes that come with toothpaste attached and weigh nothing.  So. if your traveling overseas or somewhere where ounces don't count these are great and compact enough.If ounces count check out the Wisp toothbrushes you'll be glad you did.  I am now happy I have both and I recommend both for different uses."
1,"I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.What's wrong with it?1- the threader part used to be longer & stiffer. thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework. especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth. Now it's short. flimsy. & bends so easily. it doesn't do the job it was designed to accomplish2- the floss portion used to be much thicker. fluffier & stronger. Now it is a mere shadow of itself. and as such is totally useless. And. it shreds!I had read the poor reviews. and always try to keep an open mind. Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on.  This stuff is worthless. Do not waste your money. Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution."
1,"This is IMHO the best floss you can get with or without braces. It takes some practice. and when you get it. you will see how effective this floss is. The fabric works very well at removing an incredible amount of gunk b/w your teeth. It will shred if you get it caught on your braces or if you snag it on something but again it takes practice to avoid doing that. I havent been able to find this stuff in stores around my home. usually. its the only hanger thats empty. Annoying so I have had to buy online."
1,"I had to try this after reading its description.  My denture comfort liner had come off (as my orthodontist said it would) and I couldn't afford an airline trip to have him reline my upper denture.  I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me. and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable.  Even after I faithfully followed the instructions. I got poor results.  It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours...and. much to my surprise. the stuff came off in a gooey mass.  I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures--it's an effort. just getting the cream out of the tube--hoping that exposure to air might mean better results. but that didn't work either."
1,"This may be the world's worst product. It is hard to work with. even when following the directions carefully. Once in place. it squishes out of your dentures all over the outside. No matter how much you clean it off. moer of it squishes right back out again. In addition. even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more. when the denture is removed. the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth; not in the denture. No doubt. this manufacture was trying to make a product to help people but it does not work."
1,"This is a weird sort of &#34;goo&#34; that comes out malleable like fairly hard putty. It can be molded. but it's a little too hard to mold to the gums well enough. I left it in for a few days and it was VERY hard to remove! It seems to have a slightly glue-like consistency. I can see it being perhaps useful in &#34;fine-tuning&#34; a temporary reline kit. but DON'T confuse it with actual denture adhesive. It doesn't stick to the gums AT ALL."
1,"'Cushion Grip' is a paste that is formulated to hold loose dentures in place for a long time - several days in fact (not that it is recommended to keep a denture in for days on end!).  Said another way. the paste has properties that allow it to remain retentive for several days.  I have recommended it to some of my denture patients (if they have a properly made denture. yet still need added retention).If you have to use excessive amounts of paste to keep a denture in. then the denture probably needs to be remade or relined (or perhaps an implant supported denture should be considered in cases of severe bone loss).konedog"
1,"First off I would not call this adhesive. It works good to use it at night before bed. I put in warm water till soft. roll it like a worm and sit it in the denture. Close my mouth till comfortable not tight.  It feels warm at first  and I try not to clamp my teeth or move my mouth much. In the morning dentures come right out not stuck at all. If product overflowed above denture I gently trim it. After that I use my regular adhesive and dentures fit great. You take them out wash and put back in with your reg adhesive for four or five days till the Cushion Grip starts coming loose.  Soak dentures in warm water and you can work the old Cushion Grip loose in one piece. I would only recommend for people that have really loose dentures as a temp fix.  It does need to be used with reg adhesive because Cushion Grip is not an true adhesive. just builds up and fills in dentures."
1,"Nice product but after many trials. opted for another adhesive product.  Although CUSHION GRIP is  a good product. it takes second place. in my opinion. to EFFERGRIP.  Why?  Well. CUSHION grip requires placing tube in hot water for about 5 or so minutes and then applying to dentures.  Besides. it costs a lot more than the EFFERGRIP.  For some folks. this could be seen as okay because CUSHION GRIP doesn't need to be applied every day but maybe every 3-5 days while EFFERGRIP requires daily application.All in all. the ease of use of EFFERGRIP makes it the top choice. in my humble opinion."
1,"'Sea Bond' denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste. gel. or powder. the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist. I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue. In this case. the Sea Bond pad fills in in the gap and helps seal the denture. I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this. However. dentures are not cheap and this product serves as a stop-gap measure until a new denture or reline can be done.Jim 'Konedog' Koenig. DDS"
1,"After a friend burned some gum tissue on some overheated coffee. a dentist recommended this product. both for its healing properties and overall cleansing ability.  As listed above. this product is recommended (by 'dental professionals!')for canker sores. gum irritations. denture & mouth sores. orthodontic irritations. mouth burns. and cheek bites (I'm not sure what the latter is).  I tried a little. and the taste was pleasant and the liquid nonirritating.  There is a mild foaming action as well.  Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional."
1,"This is the regular Plax (not a knock off product). With the free shipping and no tax. it beat the prices I can get at the local stores even on sales. However. it still isn't very cheap. Maybe if you get lucky with a sale you can beat the price at retail.I use a little measure graduated cylinder (rectangle actually) from a water test kit to measure out about 7ml when I use this stuff. If you swig it out of the bottle you'll find you probably use 10-20 ml per rinse. All you really need is 6 to 7 ml. and at the prices for this. you are wise to make yourself measure it out. You might as well anyway to not waste..."
1,"I like always have to take good care of my own teeth.I did a little research like I always do.and found I wanted to try this mouthwash. however it is hard to find this available at any store :(But after searching and doing my homework I found it at: www.drugstore.com/A store I highly recommend.I do all my shopping for items that you would so at that store online.Getting back to the mouthwash. I ordered it because I had heard so many good things about it. things not all mouthwashes do. you see therefore not all are equal.It has a nice taste. I hate the other ones that make you feel like a rocket went off in your mouth and is so strong and zesty!This one is pleasant. and nice.I suggest you try this. I just wish it was more available. I worry they will discontinue it. So you might want stock up on this if you like it. Yes &#34;note to self&#34;"
1,"okay i was very skeptical about this at first. but after i tried it. it seemed to help me cure gingivitis! and plus it softens up tartar buildup so you are actually brushing away hard tartar without the dentists need!Amazing ive been using this for about a week now and 1 week ago i had a small tartar formation and today its reduced by a large percentage!i freaking love Plax this will put those cheapskate dentists out of business!Listerine and Crest despise products that actually help the teeth get rid of plaque and tartarall Crest and Listerine can do is just give you a 'tartar and plaque fighting solution' but Plax actually removes alot of plaque buildup and dissolves tartarof course it doesnt say it dissolves tartar on the product but you have to use logic. tartar comes from fossilized plaque or plaque builduponce you get rid of plaque you have raw access to tartar if you have raw access to tartar its only a matter of time until its all gone5 stars.oh its a prebrush rinse use it before you brush"
1,"I've tried them all.  Natural Ice is one of the best. and MUCH cheaper than many others.  The cherry flavor fades quickly so you're NOT tempted to bite or lick at your lips.  It goes on smoothly which is important when your lips are chapped and dry.  Your lips respond almost immediately.  There is a slight tingling when you put it on. which is the medication going to work.  I bought one dozen in January. and I bought 2 more today. That fact alone says a lot.Caution: Be careful if you get it on your fingers not to rub at your eyes.  It will sting."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
1,"I have used this product (lip balm)for a long time. and I am extremely satisfied with it. because it has SPF15 and menthol. That is why I ordered this product again.The shipment arrived sooner than expected and the product is undamaged. I was keeping my fingers crossed because the climatic condition for the past few days has been extremely hot. Said and done. the lip balm did not melt.I. highly recommend. NATURAL ICE MENTHOLATED SPF15 Lip Balm for every one for daily use.Thank you. people at NATURAL ICE and thank you. AMAZON.SincerelyKJ Kumar"
1,"Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips. that peel and bleed.  Chapstick. Carmex. etc...  work for me. but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So. I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST. and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product. I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands. not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful."
1,"In an urgent need to fix badly cracked/chapped lips I turned to Amazon to find a lip balm.I first tried outBurt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube. .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)only to end up with no improvement after 3 or so days. Although this might not be a fair amount of time I was in agony over my lips and needed a quick fix. I was in need of moisturizing my lips and repairing them. not just protecting them from further damage.I turned to Mentholatum Natural Ice hoping this would be an improvement over Burt's (for me. not that either product is bad) only to find out they were pretty much the same. There was no noticeable difference and my lips weren't improving after another 3 days.I would recommend this product for proactive lip protection. but I would look elsewhere for a moisturizing lip balm when being reactive to cracked/chapped lips."
1,"This is by far the best product...ever...for Urinary Infections.  Better than anything you can have prescribed by a Doctor.  I did a lot of research about Cystex before I even ordered it.This is a very cleaver product...each tablet contains 1/2 of a normal aspirin. which acts against the immediate pain. and another ingredient that creates a chemical reaction in the kidneys and bladder and kills the bacteria and cures the problem.  I am a very allergic person and afraid to take any medication. but this is a dream come true for me.  Don't expect it to work in minutes. but all of a sudden...in a few hours...you will feel pain free.  The bottle says dose is 2 Tablets every eight hours. but I only take one every eight hours for two days and it's just great.  This is a staple for every medicine cabinet."
1,"This product is good and I like it. however the price keeps going up just like many other things once they notice it is selling and get greedy. I am seeking a generic brand of this product so that I can lower my out of pocket expenses. I am a man and do use this product. it really does help when you are exposed to bacteria in your system. I will seek an alternative if price does not lower back to the acceptable range it was at previously or seek another store that sells at the lower price."
1,"I keep these around for emergencies. Recently. I was waiting on the doctor to phone in a prescription for me because it was the second bladder infection in less than a month and I didn't have time for an office visit. Well. she took her sweet time about it. Without these. I probably would have ended up in urgent care over the weekend. With Cystex I almost forgot I had a bladder infection until I forgot to take them one day and I was quickly reminded. I highly recommend keeping a bottle of this in your medicine cabinet. especially if your prone to frequent bladder infections."
1,"I get UTIs when I get overtired/overtextended. around twice a year.  I had been taking AZO but it did not control the pain from the most severe infections (which always happen Saturday at 4 pm when the Doctor is not available until Monday!).  AZO was OK for mild infections.So this time I did some research and people spoke highly of Cystex. Since I didn't have enough time to order it from Amazon I bought it at CVS.  It is significantly (25-30%) cheaper than AZO and works better (at least for me). For the most severe UTIs I would still go to the Doctor and get antibiotics but for moderate and inconveniently timed UTIs. Cystex works beautifully and is a real savior. The pain went away in about 20 minutes and after 2 days of suffering. it was wonderful."
1,"Wish I'd known about this product in my 20s. Now that I'm in my 40s. I find that the hormonal changes are making UTIs something I need to be vigilant about again. after many years without them. I alternate between taking one of these at bedtime. & a daily tsp of D-mannose as a preventive measure. The mannose absorbs & carries away bacteria & the Cystex has a disinfecting action. so a multi-pronged approach. However. for travel these are a good deal less trouble than mannose which is a white powder. I have not had a single UTI in the 6 months I have been using this. I also give one to my elderly collie twice a week as she has developed the same issue. =o)  At least we're in this menopausal adventure together."
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
1,"This product changed my bladder problems from bad to better. but I still have flow problems.The main thing is that a full 6 tablets caused me to have spells of disorientation. I take no drugs. so it wasn't a compatibility issue. I now take 1 in the morning and two at bedtime with no ill effects. The full dose of 2 three times daily caused me problems.I am 68 and a major cancer survivor. but I don't think that affected it.UPDATE: 3/26/2013Working well now. I have chronic bladder problems. but I take 2 tablets in the morning. 1 in the afternoon. and 2 at night. I think I've adjusted to it now. Still have some flow issues. but the bladder discomfort is long gone. I recommend it! Better than Rx drugs.TaosGuy"
1,"When your kids go to school they get exposed to just about everything. About once a year our grandson gets the flu and sick to his stomach. He also has allergies that can make him sick to his stomach when he eats certain foods. Emetrol seems to settle down his nausea and help him not feel so ill.It contains no products that a child should be normally afraid of taking and it is doctor recommended. It does seem to help him a lot. It does recommend that you should not drink any fluids immediately before or after taking the product.We have had good success with it and we keep it on hand for those emergencies!"
1,"I've been a pack a day smoker for 40 years now and I just gotta kick this stupid habit. Been using these every day for the past six weeks now and have not yet smoked a cigarette in that time. I think that at this point it might just be psychological. but I'm still tempted to head over to 7-11 and buy a pack. so I keep putting on a 21 mg patch every morning and continue to tell myself how disgusting it would be if I start smoking again. Still taking it minute by minute and day by day. but I never could be doing this without the aid of the NicoDerm patches."
1,"Bought cheap CVS brand patches and they never stuck to my skin.  These stayed on the whole day through.It itched a little bit but nothing I coulnt eventually ignore (itching subsided as day wore on).When I removed the patch there was a red blotch there. but other than seeing it was red it didnt hurt nor itch nor have any other symptoms.  Redness went away by the end of the next day (you use a different area of skin for each new patch each day).Dreams were vivid when I left patch on overnight.  Vivid. but not nightmarish in any sense.  I actually enjoyed it.The nicotine was very effective in quelling my urge to smoke. though I didnt quit smoking.  At the peak of my efforts I was down to 6-7 cigarettes per day when I had been smoking close to 40.As a nicotine substitute. it delivers!"
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
1,"I quit smoking twice. so far (hope I won't have to quit a third time but that remains to be seen...).The first time I used NRT. specifically NicoDerm. I followed all the three steps. for as long as it was recommended. It worked. I was able to quit smoking. Staying quit though. that was a whole different matter. I took smoking again after about 3 months. and kept smoking for 6 months when I quit again. This time around I used Allen Carr's method. and it was by far a more efficient method. It's all about mentality and unfortunately. NRT reinforces the wrong kind of mentality."
1,"This is a stable and excellent product. The quality of the blades are very good. subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had. There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation. A very good product to buy. those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades. At Amazon - the price is excellent for this product. Just update - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back. NO RUSTS."
1,"I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far. I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip. I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham"
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
1,"This is the ONLY razor I've ever found that can cut through my husband's beard.  No. I don't live with Grizzy Adams. but he's close! :)  Life without these is just ridiculous - he has to shave 3 times a day with any other razor.  Really. no kidding.  This razor not only does an outstanding job. but it doesn't cut up his face in the process. I cannot say enough good about this razor.  He's been using them for 12 years and won't be without them.  Highly. highly recommend!"
1,"This product is an excellent buy and at 1/4th the cost at any store or online sites.  My family loves the product and recommend this product as a great buy.  I even subscribed so the product  is delivered without having to go and order it.  The product just comes when I decide how often.  This is a wonderful program which recommend to all who use products and not have to go and order it over and over!!  A must buy with an awesome program to make it easier to get the best at a good cost :)"
1,"I tried the Fusion product and have now gone back to Mach3.  I contacted P&G; over my concerns and must say that you are totally on your own if you have a problem.  P&G; won't even take the time to respond to a person letter or issues related to their products.The Mach3 is a good. simple and straight-forward product that works well.  The price on all blades is so very. very high when you think about the basic components. but one needs them.  So. this is my preference."
1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
1,"shaving almost daily for 30+ years now and tried most brands cartridge or disposable.atra was a great blade my worst experience the schick intuition plus.any of the mens mach3 blades a mug. brush and shaving soap is all you will needfor what may be one of life's finest pleasures...Closest shave on this planet. like silk baby!excellent blades. cost and experience for precision quick shavers..no man could ever beat our timing and terrain girlsmake sure you only buy your blades from amazon. don't get ripped upwith bootleg blades around here.blow dry them or place razor in a cup or stand at least(keep them clean/dry)for blade life.no goosebumps or forget about it. turn up the heat please.as for fusion and proglide i love them/but they are costly and mach3 willgive you the fine bare shave you desire for less."
1,"We've been using Mach 3 razors since the 1990s. and I buy this 15-pack here on Amazon because they're cheaper at $1.84/each than buying them at Costco.  Add in free SuperSaver or Prime shipping and they're a great deal!We like that the Mach 3 razor cartridges last for several weeks. even with daily shaving.  They give a smooth. close. nick-free shave without any irritation. and the blades don't rust when left in the shower.We've tried all kinds of blades through the years. and always come back to Mach 3."
1,"This is a decent blade that will give a nice shave for a few days. maybe weeks. with the added advantage of being able to get in tight spots better than later bigger head models of Gillette razors.  The biggest drawback is the price.  Gillette sucks you in with a low cost razor that uses high cost blades.  It's like some printers that are sold at cost or below just to get you into the market for expensive cartridges.  It's gotten so bad that many retailers keep Mach3 and Fusion blades under lock and key to prevent theft.  I've switched back to a double edged razor where you might expect an initial one-time cost of the razor but with very low cost replacement blades. not to mention double edged razors give closer shaves than the Mach3 or Fusion.  And they'll never go out of date.  So these blades get 3 stars for a combination of a decent shave combined with an exorbitant price."
1,"been using mach 3 blades for years. and they work great. I've (unknowingly) bought knockoffs on ebay before. and was able to tell the difference immediately and got a refund. Since then I've been buying them on amazon. because they're cheapest here as long as you buy a decent quantity.I've tried 4-blade and 5-blade razors. and none are any better. so I haven't bothered to permanently switch.also. you can make your blades last longer by storing the blades in mineral/baby oil when not in use. It prevents the oxidation and dulling of the blades"
1,"I have owned Mach3 razor for over 3 years now. The razor is good. but hard to differentiate its performance from Sense Excel ( I have owned that one before). Only reason I switched to Mach3 was honestly. I got bored using the same razor. The blades give normal performance. nothing out of the blue like they show on tv. It doesn't causes itching. so that the good part about the blades. However. after a month of use. for a good shave you will need multiple strokes on the same spot. Overall. decent purchase. nothing extraordinary."
1,"I'm an older guy with a very tough beard. When I was just beginning to shave (about 48 years ago) my father proudly gave me a Remington electric razor.  It never did a good enough job and I found myself going for a Gillette blade system.I have used these Gillette Mach 3's ever since they came out. They do the job for me better than anything else I've tried. so I've stuck with them. I buy them on Amazon when the price is right.For those reviewers claiming that they received fake blades. send them back for a refund. Or better yet. contact Gillette and let them know what you received.  Gillette wants to stop the trade in counterfeit blades and will be happy to work with you."
1,"I've used the Mach 3. in its different incarnations. for the past 10 years or so.  But I've always hated buying refill cartridges because of the price.  I even resorted to using disposable Mach 3s for the past few months. but I really hated them.  I was very happy to find these refill cartridges available on Amazon for such a good price. especially with Subscribe and Save.  Now I get them delivered to me at a great price.  Now if I could only find the Mach 3 Turbo or M3Power refill cartridges for the same price..."
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
1,"These razors are definitely solid. I've been using Mach 3 razors for a long time and always get a close shave. quickly and with cuts being very rare and usually the result of my own negligence. That being said these razors are just too expensive! They are even more in the grocery store. but even online they are more than 2 dollars when you buy a dozen! Shortly after I bought this box of razors I discovered Dorco which has a mach 3 like system with razors that costs less than a dollar each and are very sharp. I switched to Dorco after I finished out this box of razors."
1,"IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONI fell in love with Mach3 razors years and switched over from a single-blade (not straight-edge) razor.  I just wish the price was cheaper!  I saved a few bucks and time by ordering these Mach3 razors directly through Amazon.  Everything went fine with the order.  The package arrived quickly and the product was not opened.  The razors appear to be in their original packaging (plastic is not cut and it is the Gillete stuff).THE CATCHI thought I had gotten past all the online negative reviews of counterfeits.  Nonetheless. I found it quite odd that the plastic cases (holding 4 razors each) were scrapped and had smudges on them once I cut open the plastic packaging.  Those oddities seem to suggest the product is not brand new.CONCLUSIONAll seems fine so far.  We'll see..."
1,"Shaving is about as personal thing you can do. It's not an experience you can share. It doesn't make for scintillating conversation. So. PERSONALLY. the Gillette Mach 3 is the best razor for my beard. My beard is pretty tough: to use the belabored joke. my five o'clock shadow makes its appearance around noon. And it's thick. However. the skin underneath is very sensitive. This razor gives me that 'close shave' without irritating my face. The price for the cartidges are. yes. a little high. But it's a small price to pay for a product that works. It's sort of like paying a little extra for 'bathroom tissues'. (But that's another personal thing we do alone that rarely makes for scintillating conversation.)"
1,"Sometimes it just makes sense to shell out the additional funds for a superior product. I have a very tough and fast-growing beard that is a challenge to all the different razors (manual and electric) I've tried over the past 45 years.  I have stayed with the Mach 3 ever since it first came out and even convinced my wife that it would be good for shaving her legs. Actually she picked it up once instead of using her usual disposable and from then on I kept finding my razor in the shower.I learned a long time ago when using knives and axes that a good cutting edge needs to be complimented by a proper handle.  Normally the heavier and more durable the handle. the better the cut.  The Mach 3 handle is slightly beefier than most and it makes a difference. resulting in a good angle during application and a smoother shave with no irritation.  Until someone can prove to me that there is a better razor out there. we're sticking with the Mach 3."
1,"I'm buying this set of 6 shaving creams for my husband for the 2nd time....if he didn't like the cream he would have said not to purchase again. At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me. I think it smells good and my husband is happy with how it shaves....so there you have it. not exactly a rave review but definitely a 'thumbs up'.Cheers"
1,"$13 might seem like a lot of money for a bottle of cold medication but it's really difficult to put a price on good nights sleep!I was a little put off by the price of Vicks VapoSteam but I didn't realize how long this stuff will last. This bottle. for my Vicks humidifier. will definitely last the entire winter season. so the price isn't so much when you think about it that way.I worried that the smell might be too strong or even irritating but it doesn't overwhelm at all. it's actually quite comforting as it just sort of lofts around my bedroom.I don't use it only when I have a cold but when my head or nasal passages are just stuffed up from daily allergies (my cats!:) or the dry. discomforting winter air that's so irritating to my nose.  About 10 minutes after the humidifier is turned on. my breathing is so much easier and pleasant. I really appreciate this stuff."
1,"I've never understood why Amlactin (and same-formula creams/lotions) have never been very popular for dry skin. People always go for the cosmetic brand lotions. but Amlactin works differently and MUCH better.  The active ingredient in Amlactin is lactic acid. which exfoliates dry. itchy or bumpy skin. and is great for those with keratosis pilaris. After just a few applications. you'll notice soft. supple. silky smooth skin.It smells a touch &#34;chemical-ish&#34; but it's not strong and the scent doesn't last. like some scented lotions. Also. since it's not fragranced. guys can use it too (actually my dad does).It tends to run a bit on the pricy side for lotions. but it's definitely worth it. especially if you have rough. dry. bumpy skin."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
1,"I have used this product for Keratosis Pilaris Rubra (KPR - the type of KP that involves reddish bumps) all over my arms. Unfortunately. it makes the inflammation worse. While it (perhaps) may be good for Keratosis Pilaris Alba (the type of KP that doesn't have redness on/around the bumps). it worsens my type of KP since it inflames the skin. Produced a rash on my arms that put me through itchy. painful. burning hell for a week. It hurt my skin so bad.On a positive note: Good moisturizer though. Just worthless treatment for KP.What a waste of much needed money and hope for a cure for this darned skin ailment! :o("
1,"My dermatologist recommended AmLactin and Carmol 20 Cream to help with severe dry cracked heels. I used both products for several weeks into a couple of months and had *some* improvement but there was still a ways to go before I'd say my feet were going to be 'baby soft'. I wasn't really pleased with the expense. odor. and clammy feel that I'd experience with this combination and still getting lackluster results. so I did some more searching.I found a really good electric callous remover; it is made by Bario and hopefully you can find one with a google search. I continued to try different creams and lotions and have settled on one that really works and works fast - O'Keefes Creme. This creme is inexpensive. non-greasy. and unscented. I saw excellent results within a week - the elusive 'baby soft' feet everyone has been talking about. Finally!Hope everyone finds *something* that works for them."
1,"I've got keratosis pilaris. aka chicken skin. This does a great job of smoothening out the skin on my arms. It takes awhile to start working. as in weeks to months. but you'll definitely feel a difference. I feel less self conscious about my arms when in public wearing a short sleeved shirt.The only thing i didn't like about it was how runny it is. It's very watery. so you should rub it between your hands then distribute it to the body part otherwise it'll just drip everywhere. Also once it's on your skin it feels kind of sticky for awhile. till it absorbs more.Overall i'd recommends this product because it does it's job pretty well. Price is a little higher than i'd like but my arms are smoother so i'm happy to pay that price."
1,"I put this lotion on everything. It is hands down one of the most important beauty products that I couldnt live without. I use this all over and it is the ONLY lotion I have found which 1. doest break me out. 2. actually moisturizes my skin. 3. I can use on my body and my face. I blend drops of hyaluronic acid which I buy from Amazon in with the moisturizer for an added boost. It keeps my skin glowing. smooth and beautiful.I also use this on my boyfriends KP and it is the first time he said he has had any success in getting it to go away.I am impressed with this product more than any other beauty product."
1,"AmLactin moisturizing products come in different strengths to help alleviate rough. dry skin. This 'Moisturizing Body Lotion' is for everyday use (recommended use is 2X daily) and works well to keep skin hydrated.For a dry skin cure. begin with AmLactin's 'XL Lotion' for feet and hands or 'Ultra Hydrating Body Cream' for all over smoothing. Once your desired results are achieved. switch to this one for maintenance.Currently Amazon directly sells only the Moisturizing Body Lotion. It is also the only Amlactin product available through Subscribe and Save. Other AmLactin products are available from third parties. some of whom are Prime eligible.You'll be hard pressed to find the Moisturizing Lotion anywhere for less than Amazon and I cross my fingers that Amazon will again directly sell the other AmLactin products."
1,"My husband brought this home to me and I was excited to use it. I have very dry skin and I am always looking for soothing body butters that moisturize. Well this stuff is not even close. and should not be considered by anyone with very dry skin. It goes on smooth and then disappears. never to be felt again. My skin sucked it right in and was dry again in about 10 minutes. There is a reason why it states on the label to apply twice a day. but it still didn't make a difference. Its an ultra liquified lotion.I'm happy it worked for other people. but like Marissa. it did not work for me. For the record. I bought Nivea Essentially Enriched body cream. I love it! Its greasy at first. but my skin is soft. smooth. and STAYS moisturized all day. AND you only have to apply it once."
1,"I bought this lotion after a friend recommended it.  After my first use. the ammonia smell was too much to bear....it cut clear through my clogged nasal passages (I have a really bad cold).  Perhaps I should have known this ammonia scent would happen since ammonium lactate is the 2nd listed ingredient...but for some reason. I did not review the ingredients list so it didn't even occur to me.  This lotion is so very expensive that I expected something different.  Due to the very prominent ammonia smell. I couldn't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.  Surely there is a more pleasant way to exfoliate and moisturize."
1,"I live in the southwest and had pretty dry skin so my doctor recommended I try this stuff.  After about a week of use. once a day every day. I notice an obvious difference in my skin.  Areas that were dry and peeling aren't anymore and my skin is noticeably softer.  I ordered this size because I like lotions that have a pump. I find I used them more frequently and the bottle isn't as messy. and this one is no exception.  I would certainly recommend this product!"
1,"Yes. this stuff stinks. I think one of my pharmacy customers said it best: 'It makes me smell like Chicken in a Biskit crackers.' BUT. all alpha hydroxy acid products have a distinct. somewhat unpleasant smell. If your alpha hydroxy acid product doesn't stink. it probably doesn't have much (or any) alpha hydroxy acid in it.I guess they could try to cover it up with heavy fragrance. but that's never a good idea for a product used for treating skin conditions. The stink does fade after a few minutes. but if you apply it heavily. it will still be detectable for a few hours.I don't like how thick this is. but that's just a personal preference. Many people will enjoy the texture.Works well for keratosis pilaris. if you use it religiously. Helps dry rough feet a bit. but mostly if you start off with a clean slate (get rid of the corns/calluses first)."
1,"I have extremely dry skin and was constantly itching and scratching. sometimes actually causing bleeding. I tried AmLactan Mosturizing Body Lotion and FINALLY got some relief from the constant scratching. It took about four days to completely stop all the scratching. I used the product just once a day. even though the directions say to apply twice daily. Now my skin is soft and silky feeling and the scabs from bleeding have disappeared. The ammonia like smell of older bottles that I have used is no longer present. They seem to have improved the formulation. It's now completely odor free. I just found the 20 ounce size on sale at Costco.com for $15.49 including shipping. I will never stop using this product. It works just as advertized. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin and itching. Visit the manufacturers website at amlactin.com for more information and you can even sign up for their newsletter. I'm a fan FOREVER!"
1,"I got this form my local store because of an article I read. It works great on feet and body. I had a bad callus on my food - I know. disgusting. sorry. BUT I used this every night for about a week before it began to disappear. It makes my feet soft and absolutely amazing. HOWEVER. if you have cracked heels or calluses. they will come back if you do not use this lotion continuously. I guess that's the downside of it. I found this out the hard way when I stopped using it once my feet felt like velvet.Just so you know the generic name for this is Ammonium Lactate Topical. Exactly same stuff. but... cheaper."
1,"My dermatologist recommended I use this lotion for extremely dry skin.  (I don't have any other skin conditions. so please keep that in mind if you are considering using this product for a specific issue other than dry skin.)I've been using it twice a day for about 5 days and am totally impressed with the results.  My skin was VERY dry and VERY itchy. and this lotion has completely eliminated those symptoms.  My skin feels great. and I'm not constantly itching and fidgeting!My only complaint is that the lotion is tacky when applied.  This little feature is annoying. but not bad enough to make my stop using the lotion.  I highly recommend this lotion for super dry skin."
1,"I have a moderate case of KP that seems to be getting worse with age.  I bought this lotion at the store a week ago and after using it for just a few days. my arms look so much better.  I'm hoping if I continue to use it. the KP will go away completely.  So far. it's the only thing that has helped this condition.  I didn't have very high hopes for it but it is worth a shot if you are suffering from KP."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
1,"Purchased this to use on a thyroidectomy scar immediately after surgery. I used it for a year before giving up. It did provide some relief to the itchy dry feeling of a healing wound but it did nothing to diminish the scar.I also used this on a scar left from severe acne immediately when it was safe to use. It actually made it worse. My scar became beat red. I discontinued use and began to apply aloe gel to the scar. Within one day the redness was gone and the scar began to diminish.There are positive reviews on this product. maybe it will work better for you. It's very expensive. I would recommend trying an aloe gel first. I purchased a large bottle for $3 at Trader Joe's."
1,"My Physical Therapist recommended this to me to help with tissue mobility above the area where I had a plate and screws put into my fibula where I had surgery for a broken bone.  It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible.  It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box.  That said it did accomplish what my PT wanted but I don't give 5 stars because I don't see it as a &#34;must have&#34; or &#34;must buy&#34; which I consider a 5 star rating to be."
1,"I have yet to see if it will improve overall healing of my scar.  I won't know for several months but my initial experience with this product is mediocre.  Only a tiny amount may be applied without having a flaking mess on my skin after it dries.  The box says that it is must be rubbed in well and even that does not keep the flaking away unless only a tiny amount is used at a time.  It forms a film on the skin.I wish I had ordered the mederma with spf in it because whenever I leave the house I have to apply spf anyway.  Consider that when you buy.  Also. you will not need a lot of this product unless you have a large scar to cover.  Consider the smaller tube."
1,"I have big skin grafts. and I stopped using it after 6 months. then began again a year later.  And I saw almost immediate results when I began again.  Even my boyfriend noticed.  I have also been using it on a  section of tattoo that I just got which scarred on a few lines.  In a few months the raised skin came down and it doesn't bother me anymore.  The stuff definitely works.  Too bad its so expensive in stores.  The gel is tough to get out of tube when it gets 1/2 full."
1,"I can assure you a 100% you will not see any improvement in this from 1 tube! Got to help with unsightly stretch marks and thought this might help with them. but knew this would not cure them. I applied the gel as directed to the affected area as directed for 3 months and saw absolutely no improvement in the skin or color of the scars. and the fact that the tube is so small you will not get enough of the gel to last to see any improvement with out several tubes! So I rate this 1 out of 5 stars considering this is but a common snake oil and should not be advertised to help improve stretch marks! And on a side not I would not recommend this to anyone looking to improve the sight of scars or stretch marks!"
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
1,"I had a HUGE newly healed scrape that took up half my forearm and it was starting to scar up in a weird bumpy way.  I wasn't sure if this was really going to work because reviews seemed mixed. but it sounded like the newer the scar is. the better it works.  Honestly. I've been using it for a few weeks (I try for once a day. but I occasionally forget) and the results are AMAZING.  It literally looks better every day.  The weird bump &#34;over scarring&#34; areas were gone after TWO days.  Now my scar had JUST healed.  I started applying it a few days after the last of the scabbing had gone. so I suspect that's why I've had such great luck."
1,"I've used Mederma in the past and it worked really well. Well. I've had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella. I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing. I've been using it for a little over a month.and again it's working. This is good stuff. I saw improvement in a week. Of course I would purchase this again.if fact I'll be doing that real soon. I would recommend this to a friend. I think Mederma deserves more than five stars."
1,"I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing."
1,"Thanks to an accident at the river I ended up with a large scar at my wrist. I have scars over most of my body so it didnt bother me. What did bother me is going to hand cashiers money and them looking down at my wrist and looking back up at me with that 'oh my he tried to' looks. The mederma has smoothed the surface and reduced the red shade by 2/3 after 4 weeks. I'm going to continue using the product for another 4 weeks and see how much better it gets."
1,"I had a hip replaced and my doctor had recommended this product to help reduce scarring since I scar easily.  I had a fairy long and nasty looking scar so I decided to give this a try.  Here is what I found:1.  The cream is easy to apply and goes a long way!2.  The cream does soften the skin area and makes it itch less.3.  After 3 months my scar has reduced noticeably.  Instead of being raised and hard. it is flat and soft.  There is still a red line. but that is fading in places.While this product is definitely not an instant fix. it does work!  I have several scars that I have acquired through the years that while small. look far worse than this major surgery scar does now!  I am quite happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to reduce the amount of scar tissue."
1,"I've used Mederma diligently for a couple of months; it was great in making fresh scars barely visible. but not so great with old scars. It is worth a try. but be prepared to be very disciplined - it won't work if it's not applied at least twice a day. for at least 2-6 months.On the other hand. and to be completely honest. I believe petroleum jelly. aloe vera or other similar skin repair products would have the same results if applied 3-4 times a day. for 3-6 months (as directed for Mederma). since the skin regenerates and changes almost completely within this interval. I'm sorry I can't write a raving review and collect dozens of helpful votes. but this is my honest opinion. I don't want to be a kill-joy. I just wish someone had told me the same so I could save some money."
1,"I use this for cracked heels. cuticle oil. pimples. sunburn. & dry chapped hands and lips.  A little goes a long way. and it absorbs nicely (sometimes takes a few minutes to go away).  I'm always amazed how much better my hands are in the morning when I put e-oil on before I go to bed.  Same with my heels.  The higher IU's is too thick for my tastes. this seems to have the best viscosity for whatever I need it for.  I even put it on a Q-Tip and put it in my nose when I'm getting ready to run the tiller or mow because of the dust.  Keeps me from getting such a nasty sinus headach and has a nice lemony smell compared to the menthol that's for colds and flu.  This is awesome stuff."
1,"I never try vitamin E oil before but I am using vitamin C serum which is good to follow  with vitamin E oil especially at night time for better results. this oil is awesome. I just love it!!! is very rich so just a few drops (2 to 3) covers my entire face. the bottle is small enough which makes it very convenient for traveling. some oils have  a rancid smell. this oil smells a bit like lemon grass it's a pleasure to apply it after my vitamin C serum. leaves my skin so smooth and dewy for the next morning. I highly recommend this product."
1,"Niacin is quite effective in reducing bad cholesterol in your blood. especially in my case. I am sensitive to most statin drugs prescribed by doctors.  The usual downside to it's regular use is flushing from dilating the blood vessels while it is being absorbed.  Slo Niacin has an enteric coating that slows the absorbtion. so that the &#34;flush&#34; is not a problem. It is important to watch the date on the product. as the enteric material loses some of it's effect with time. Slo Niacin is also much less costly than statin drugs."
1,"If you have high LDL cholesterol and you have not been able to reduce it with diet and exercise. this Slo-Niacin tablets will do the job. The slow release minimizes flashing that is normally associated with Niacin and the results are incredible. I have been trying to lower my Cholesterol for the last couple of years but with no success. I was stuck in the range of 230-235 and even though I was taking Flash-Free Niacin. my number was not dropping. Two months ago I found out by reading posts on the Internet that Flash-Free Niacin does not work for lowering cholesterol. So. I started looking for another way and found the Slo-Niacin which is regular niacin that is released slowly. This worked great. I took 1500 mg a day for a month and my cholesterol dropped from 233 to 130.  I was shocked by how well it worked.  It makes you wonder why doctors prescribe drugs when a natural supplement like Niacin works so well."
1,"I used Slo-Niacin for several years before switching to Niaspan (Rx required). I take a heavy dose (1500 MG nightly). After the initial couple of weeks the flushing. hot and itchy skin. occurred only about once a week. With Niaspan. the flushing (etc) happened only 2-3 times per month. Now. my drug plan has raised my cost for Niaspan by 250% !!So. I will be returning to Slo-Niacin--but the cost to me will be only $11.92 per month using Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save.' This is in contrast to the new cost of Niaspan at $50 per month. Therefore. when the itching comes on I will chant a mantra of 'But. I am saving $37 a month!'"
1,"i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well. after just taking it for two days. i had a terrible reaction to it. felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level. so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill. but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
1,"Being constantly anemic. I always dread having to take Iron pills because they leave my stomach so upset.  The Slow Fe tablets are pricey but they are worth it!  No stomach problems associated with iron at all!  My big complaint is that they are extremely hard to open.  It is so time consuming and difficult.  If you have arthritis. opening these will be a nightmare.  I still think the benefits outweigh the cons.  When I am bored. I stand and open 10 or so tablets at a time and put them in a pill box."
1,"OK. so I tried to save some $$ by getting the generic at my local store.  Big mistake.Went back to the doctor and he recommended this brand by name. so I ordered it here because it was cheaper than my drug store.I am on my second box now and it has made a world of difference in how I feel and in my test results.  I always thought generics were just the same as the name brands. but that is not the case for this supplement. I will be buying this brand again"
1,"This product (by Nature's Bounty) claims that there are 1 billion ACTIVE Lactobacilli in the pills. The best established test for ACTIVE Lactobacilli is to give them substrate (warm milk) and let them grow over night. Test Result: Two pills smashed to powder and mixed with warm milk (37'C) did NOT produce any growth (fermentation) overnight!. That means that Nature's Bounty is selling us Cellulose + Fructose flavored with strawberry. Should have done this test earlier. Will never buy from Nature's Bounty again. And will start testing one after another other vendors. Hope there will be a product for real?!"
1,"For the most part. I like certain kinds of yogurt. but I find that I just can't eat it every day.  I don't like it THAT much.  But I do want to take steps to keep my digestive system on track. and these small. sweet acidophilus chews are a great way to do just that.  I actually take one every day. even if I do eat yogurt.  Plus. the price cannot be beat.  It's always great to be able to consume things that are good for you without totally breaking the bank."
1,"The joke is that this deodorant is not the one we received. even though we wanted this one. Yes. I am aware that I am not rating the correct product. but another Speed Stick (the one that comes in white and smears. and was the last one we wanted) product. Makes anyone upset to order an specific product and receive a totally different product instead. That is why the 1 Star review. For if someone chooses this product and receives one they did not order. I think that would warrant a star. Noticed this has happened more than once. according to other reviewers. and that is Baloney. because what it means is that someone in a warehouse is substituting products at their whim.I know the actual product is great. exactly what we wanted. but since it is deceiving in showing the picture when there are no intentions on delivering that product. I give this one 2 Stars at most."
1,"Wow!! Great price for this pack of six 3.25 sticks of deodorant. Mennen surprised me with this musk deodorant & the quality of it.This deodorant is long lasting & works very well in all situations. This goes on clear & leaves no type of stain on any type of shirt. One stick is long lasting even after applying it several times a day.This is a great way to stock up at an affordable price. I am very.very particular about what I buy & use but could not find anything negative to say about this item."
1,"I've been using Speed Stick deodorant regular for years.  It is effective at killing stink.  It has a nice smell when you apply it.  The smell is not overpowering and it is not noticeable after a few minutes (I have smell sensitivity).  This product does not stain clothes or leave any marks.  I tried Tom's and Trader Joe's natural deodorant but neither of those worked and I could smell my own BO long before the day was over.  While I like to buy products that have no animal testing. I draw the line with BO and use my Speed Stick deodorant.  It's great for men or women and it's inexpensive."
1,"I've used Speed Stick before in the past and had a good experience. So. when buying online I figured I'd stick with a brand that I know will not make me break out. Well. it did not make me break out. however. the odor protection is not what I remember it to be. I really like the smell of the musk Speed Stick. Probably one of my favorite smelling deodorants. Kind of a manly cologne or aftershave scent. not too strong but every now and then you'll get a whiff and it smells great. Unfortunately. the odor protection does not last all day. Probably only last about half the day and by the end of the day I can definitely tell it isn't working anymore. I still give it three stars though for the scent."
1,"I only use this aftershave in the summer because it tends to dry my skin in the brutal Chicago winter. It works great after a nice straight razor shave; smells great and cools my skin. It's alcohol-based. but I'm surprised it doesn't sting as much as I expected. Since the dispensing hole is a bit too big. I cover half of it with my thumb before squirting it into my hand. One day. a female acquaintance hugged me and commented I smelled really good. Two weeks later she asked me out ;)"
1,"My husband is very picky about shave gels. primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin.  My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack. even though the price was under $3 a can with super saver shipping.  He is not happy with this product.  He's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products. namely. Gillette Fusion. which he prefers.  Also. insofar as use on his sensitive skin. the gel is only so-so.  The fragrance is okay with him.  However. what he particularly doesn't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide.  Now we have about four cans left. which he will grudgingly use. unless I can find him a deal on Fusion.  He's encouraging me to find one...soon."
1,"Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results. you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!"
1,"This Ultra Brite Advanced Whitening toothpaste I purchase in my local store and find it to be a superb toothpaste better than the fancy and more expensive brands.+ This cleans and foams up better in the mouth than the other brands.+ Cleans and WHITENENS better than the expensive kind I have found.+ Works great with a Spinbrush or Oral B Rechargeable toothbrush. Noticed that the Oral B one and this toothpaste work superbly together as my teeth shine and look whiter and cleaner!- For me. since I have somewhat sensitive teeth. so I use this every other day (for whitening abilities) and I use Sesodyne toothpaste on the alternate days. This works for me and keeps my sensitive teeth happy and with no sensitivity at the same time.Highly recommend this!"
1,"We use this toothpaste for two reasons; it works and it's inexpensive. We normally keep multiple boxes of this toothpaste around the house and at this point probably have around five or six unopened boxes in reserve.The toothpaste has a pleasant taste and is only moderately foamy which. in my opinion. simplifies the whole tooth brushing process.As another reviewer has pointed out a consumer testing organization has given the toothpaste high marks; that I'll have to admit was the reason I first bought this brand. According to the box the product is made in Mexico and distributed in the USA by Colgate-Palmolive. It contains sodium fluoride .24 % for anticavity protection.We have been pleased with this product for years and see no reason to change."
1,"Now how often do THOSE two words go together? Not that often in a toothpaste! Consumer Reports got me to try Ultra Brite but the results keep my buying it. I've been using it for years and personally I've never noticed any whitening effects *but* it makes my teeth feel clean and maintains a healthy mouth. Rarely any dental issues here in years. My teeth look great and I frequently get compliments on my smile. These days I use a whitening paste half the time but I keep Ultra Brite in the rotation too.UB has a nice minty taste that is not totally over powering - meaning I can actually taste food again within the hour. The paste is a nice consistency and doesn't produce too much foam even with my Oral B electric toothbrush. The price can't be beat - usually a dollar or less locally.Very pleased with this product and highly recommended."
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
1,"I ordered this a year ago for my grandmother who has arthritis & bruises easily.  Once she tried it. there was no other alternative that worked as good for her (she was using other topical creams & some burned her skin. or left a rash).  This soaks in quickly. doesn't burn or irritate the skin & actually does lighten her bruises within a couple days of using this day & night (she bumps into anything & a bruise starts. Immediately she puts this on & the bruise either doesn't happen or it fades away in a couple days).Now I am ordering again because I use this before & after workouts. when I get bruises and also to ease out the swelling & redness of acne on my face (yes. just 2 times a day on clean skin I rub this in & within a week my large. angry acne marks are gone).This stuff works quickly on pain. doesn't stain. is all natural & we could not be happier in my home using this product."
1,"Of course everyone has a different response to treatments but this has been the go to gel for minor scraps & bruises for the family.It's amazing as upon immediate application its soothes the wound and eases pain.all while healing and lessening the presence of a scar.It's a must for first aide kits and medicine cabinets especially if you have kids.I even used it on minor burns and yes. it works like a charm.Gr8 product!!Also if you have body aches.cramps or muscle pain try arnica tabletsArnica Montana 30x 250 Tabletsnow these little tablets out weigh any other pain relief tablet OTC."
1,"I grabbed this for my natural first aid kit- I use it fairly often now since its great for diminishing the pain and appearance of bruises as well as great for sore backs and hands resulting from yard work or-ahem-a tough camping trip...My son is nearly 2 and gets bruises from regular toddler antics. it is nice to know I can help the bruises go away faster- especially when we know we will be attending an event where photos will be taken...My husband only needs one application for a sore back. I used it on a smashed finger with good results- only needed it a few times to make the throbbing go away and the pain subside.the only side effect/gross part is that this can loosen dead skin-probably has alcohol in it-and the skin or other dirt and grime will pill up and swirl around on the surface when you massage this in. Yuck.but this is effective and naturally based -its just a nice product to have on hand or in your first aid kit."
1,"Hey. I am a born skeptic.  But I think that this product actually works.  And it is easy to apply.  The only down side is a somewhat unpleasant aroma. but away from the nose this does not matter.  My pain is most often in the lower back.  If I apply the gel and then sit in a chair that encourages good posture. the pain is relieved within a quarter hour.  If you have tried cooling compounds. heating compounds. etc.. and do not have a solution for pain yet. try this gel. and hopefully it will work for you as it does for me."
1,"Never would I think something so topical could work on my deep down 'what the heck did I do to cause this' back pain - but WOW.  I put it on about 2 hours ago and I don't hurt now.  Pretty amazing.  This tube is HUGE for the price. there is no smell. no sticky - it absorbs and goes right to work.  I'm no organic-shmanic gal here... I don't buy into the 'natural is better' crowd (few. but we're out here) - still - this product floored me.  It works.  I wish I'd known about it years ago.  And this is the best value anywhere.  I'm using it for muscle pain and stiffness.  You should too."
1,"Have used this Homeopathic gel for decades. As a professionally trained Modern. and Classical Ballet. dancer for over 30 + years. I have sworn by this for preventative as well as helping to speed-up recovery/healing time of sports-type & over-use injuries. Ii is essential to us dancers and athletes alike. Great for contusions. bruises and over-use injuries. Recommend. Only remember to remove all oils and perfumes from skin BEFORE using. and to be diligent enough to use in the morning and evening both. for best results."
1,"I bruise easily. and they last forever (sometimes months).  This will make my bruise disappear within a week.  The one thing I've noticed is that while the bruise will disappear. the area may still be sore like a normal bruise (although the soreness won't last as long as a normal bruise).  Definitely worth the effort and cost!!!  I had gum surgery several years ago. which is where I learned of this.  I applied both the topical gel. and took the small pellets both before and after surgery.  My jaw never bruised (which was a miracle in itself). and had minimal swelling which went away in a couple days."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
1,"I have been lifting for about 3 years now (benching about 95lbs when I started) and about a year ago I hit a wall where I could not seem to increase my max anymore.  So then about 6 months ago I started using muscle milk. glutamine powder. BCAA pills. and this Creatine Fuel.  When Before I started this regimen I was maxing out on the bench at about 185 and just last week I did 245 for the first time and I have increased in pretty much every other area as well.  I have also noticed that my arms look and feel much fuller. they are up to 16 inches now and I hope to continue my journey and maybe someday in the next year hit the 300 mark on bench and make good gains in other areas as well."
1,"i can't say this stuff work wonders.but I can't say that it doesn't help. Consistency is the key to all work outs and lower calorie intake. There those who truly believe in this product So don't take my review to heart. It could work for you better then other people everyone is different and since we all have different metabolism and health system it will work wonders for some and for some it won't. this is a case of try for yourself and see if it works for you.  Since individual result may (will) vary."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I have read from a lot of people saying it doesn't leave you groggy but if I take more than half a teaspoon I find it makes me that way.  I don't take melatonin unless I cant sleep at all or if I am not tired but it starts to work pretty fast no matter how much I take.  I guess since its a liquid it affects you quicker since I have used the pill form before.  My 3 year old who is autistic has problems sleeping and staying asleep and as far as getting to sleep she will usually go to sleep in about 10 to 15 minutes.  This was recommended over medication from our doctor which is what we prefer.  She still wakes up some nights but I don't think it has too much to do with the melatonin as it is with her.  Overall I recommend this to help people sleep naturally without resorting to medication."
1,"We have been giving this to my grandson for over a week and find that it helps to calm him down.  We give it to him about an hour before bed and it helps him to go to sleep at night instead of 11:00pm or later.  It has a 'sweet' taste so he takes it readily. Now everyone get get some rest.  He has not been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD but is a very active little boy.  I would definitely recommend it.  FYI: we are also giving him Synaptol twice a day which seems to take the 'edge' off during the day.  This has relatively no taste at all."
1,"These caplets are fine to swallow and have everything I need in them.  My doctor told me I was low on iron so I've been trying different vitamins with Iron in them.  In these vitamins though is an additive that turns my urine to bright yellow no matter how much water I drink.  I don't care for that.  I went to the doctor to see if I was having a bladder or kidney problem and all is well.  The doctor told me it was the food coloring that they put in them.  Why do that?"
1,"I used to get nauseous every day. and couldn't figure out why. I would feel fatigued and get dizzy spells also. I had tried other multi-vitamins before. and couldn't tell any difference so I stopped taking vitamin supplements. Then I started taking this one. and I stopped getting nausous. and I find that I can think more clearly and have a more sustained energy throughout the day compared to days that I don't take it. I have been taking this for a couple of years now and I'm very satisfied."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
1,"Consumer groups have a lot of info on line about which vitamins are most effectively absorbed.I'll save you the pain of what I went through reviewing the top 100 vitamins out there:Efficacy of vitamins ranges over a wide scale. The best cost perhaps $3 a day to use. The worst do the job 10% or less as well as the best ones. Name brand rarely coincides with effectiveness.These are powder in a capsule. so they absorb rapidly and do their job well. Cost is reasonable. too.What I found after a lot of research. was these occupy a unique niche between the dollars-a-day designer vitamins and the pennies a day junk. offering nearly the performance of the former at nearly the price of the latter.Enjoy! It's great having quality vitamins and not paying exorbitant prices.Recommended - and used - for years. 'It's all the vitamin you'll ever need!'To your health!"
1,"I've always found it difficult to decipher the pro's and con's of daily vitamin consumption.  The only thing I can offer is over the last month or so I've noticed a slight reduction in energy and focus.  Overall I still feel decently healthy. however. it recently dawned on me that about 3 weeks ago I stopped taking these daily vitamins b/c my supply ran dry.  Now it wouldn't be right to contribute this reduction in energy solely on the demise of my vitamin consumption but it would be safe to say it's very possible these vitamins may have been benefiting me all along.  I'm placing another order regardless :)"
1,"I started using this in combination with Raspberry Ketones and found it made me stronger in my workouts. I have also been able to keep weight off with it. But remember. nothing is a miracle pill. I use it in combination with regular workouts and watch what I eat. I keep track of calories and always expend more calories than I use. If you are not wanting to loose weight then taking this along with the Keytones about 30 minutes prior to workout should help you to be able to move more weight."
1,"I've been taking CLA for about 5 weeks.  I'm quite obese and I've noticed that my belly fat is shrinking more than usual when I'm restricting calories. I am eating about 1800 calories a day for the last four months and losing about 3-4 lbs a month.  That is fine since I've lost hundreds of lbs. over the years and always gained it back.  What I'm hoping is that I won't gain it back this time; that I can just continue eating the same. 1800. and my body. which fights me to gain. will be happy with the lower weight.  One weird thing that I have noticed is that when I take Tylenol. it's doesn't work anymore.  I take it 2-3 times a week for arthritis.  I can't take NSAIDS so that is unfortunate."
1,"I purchased this product because I have decided to be in TOTAL GREAT HEALTH. I did not want to start off with anything that would give me the shakes or have me feeling weird or bad. I wanted something natural to help with my stomach fat. I can say that I have changed my diet. smoothie in the mornings. water all day. and a full course meal with protein and vegetables. no bread and no sugar. walking every day for 30-45 minutes. I have have seen a tremendous result. I feel much better and I am determined to obtain total health."
1,"I enjoy that one soft gel is a serving. For me this was a good value. especially with being 1200mg per serving as opposed to something were you have to swallow 2 or 3 pills for the same serving.This is a very effective form of CLA with Tonalin and for the price it isn't bad. However. if foul smells bother you. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The bottle I received left such a strong odor in the room long after I took my pill and closed the jar. that I cannot take it out of the house.It's effectiveness and ease to take is great. it just really needs to stop smelling so foul.PROS:Simple to takeEasy on stomachEasy to swallowEffectiveCONS:Bad flavorBad Smell"
1,"Pros:-Small-Great stats (high in protein and calories relative in size)-The Chocolate and Mocha Chip tastes Great-No chalky tasteCons:-Fiance thinks they taste awefulBefore I bought this product I always thought Balance bars were low in protein and just a womans meal supplement.  Well. now they are my main protein bars and eat them all the time between meals when I am hungry.I would give these a 5 star. best nutritional/protein bars I have ever tried.  No chalky taste. very smooth texture (overly smooth compared to others) however. the fiance hated them.  Not sure why. but she could not even eat them. however. she loves the Cliff bar brand."
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
1,"I'm always the type that needs to snack on items through the day to avoid headaches and feeling fatigue.  I'm very physically active and don't have time to spend for large meals so need something filling. easy to take with me. and is delicious.  The chocolate craze is essentially like a desweetened chocolate bar for me.  I just can't tire of the taste. it's the best I've ever had with these nutritional bars.  I only wish they were cheaper as it's quite pricey.  But as the saying. you do get what you pay for."
1,"Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars. this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar. chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it. and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information. these bars do have a lot of protein (15g). but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
2,"This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup. 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen."
2,"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color. and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated. of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored. foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book. and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies. and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!"
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
2,"My daughter 1 year old really likes this book.  I bought it because of its similarity to the 10 little ladybugs book.  It has the same sort of colorful illustrations and I like it better as the ladybugs are not as pretty as the sparkly butterflies.  This book teaches colors as each of the butterflies finds a place to stay for the night.Update - My daughter is now well grown but this book sticks in my mind still - we read it so many times.  I would say it was one of her very favorites when she was young."
2,"So I actually bought this thinking it was the entire Lesson 2 kit. However. I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book."
2,"It took me about 40 minutes to read this lesson plan thoroughly; while it is inexpensive at under five dollars. I still don't know if that is necessarily a good value. As some reviewers have pointed out. much of the book focuses on advertising Wilton products; without all of this the useful material in the book could have been condensed down to a couple of pages. I did like the photographs and the techniques for making different consistencies of buttercream for different uses. I had initially planned on getting the subsequent lesson plans as well. but I don't think it will be worth it. If you have any skill/experience with cake decorating at all. I'd recommend skipping this book."
2,"This Wilton book is awesome.  My local craft shop did not offer the fondant course when I wanted to take it so I decided to teach myself.  I followed the lessons in the book and my fondant cakes have improved greatly.  In my area the Wilton Method instructors are not so great so I am happy I was able to save the money on the class but still get all of the wonderful Wilton advice.  I would definitely recommend not only buying this book. but seeing how much you can teach yourself before spending the money on the class."
2,"I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner. I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set. that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas. from Amazon.that work very well. I also bought the bench knife. and found a 16' cake lifter. and a 18' cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon. however. the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book. great starter outer! Oh yes. I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely.Super Chef David"
2,"I ordered this lesson plan because I took the first two courses of Wilton's Cake Decorating. and I didn't want to sign up for the 3rd course only because I didn't want to spend so much money for the classes. So I bought the kit in Michaels figuring I would teach myself but this time the lesson plan wasn't included in kit like the first 2 kits were. This lesson plan is great and if you have some experience with working with fondant and gum paste this will be a piece of cake for you. no pun intended. But this definitely isn't for a beginner."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
2,"I absolutely love this book! Before purchasing. I found myself gathering bits and pieces of information from the wilton site to make the flowers and borders that I wanted. but this book puts them all together neatly without leaving anything out. I recently purchased Colette's Cakes which is also wonderful. but so much of it is advanced. and I'm just not there. I only decorate for fun. This book sticks to basics which. for me. is essential to focus. If I see to much detail I tend to become frustrated and over anxious. Then I end up giving up. So. with this book I can actually follow the process and learn step by step without the frustration.The only small disappointment was the weight of the cover. The paper is a bit thin and will need some support or will probably not hold up very well. Nothing a little clear contact paper can't cure though. so no big deal."
2,"I've always loved cake decorating. ever since I took my first Wilton class.  Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.  The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.  It's a lot of fun but. I admit. a bit frustrating.  No matter how closely I follow the steps. my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.  I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book. as all Wilton Lesson Plans. it's great."
2,"This is an ok book for a new cake decorator. It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However. the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for 'cake decorating ideas' when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly. if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it."
2,"I'm a Star Wars fan and I bought this with the intention of using it for groceries but it turned into my new diaper bag. It's huge! I can fit everything i need in it where before I had my diaper bag and another bag and my purse. It has started to come apart on the side but I can sew it or order a new one it's so cheap. I am sure the intended purpose isn't for it to be used as a diaper bag daily but it works and I have gotten compliments on it even! It goes great with my Star Wars Vans too :D"
2,"I used to date this girl who loved Scrabble.  So. by association. I had to as well!  We used to play a lot - even with her Grandmother.  What they did. however. was 'cheat'.  We had one of these - this same Franklin Spelling Corrector you see here (an older model but same nonetheless) and you each of us was allowed to use it to come up with all kinds of crazy words.  I thought this was a dumb way to play Scrabble. at first. but then I came to love it.  If you're all 'cheating'. then it becomes a different game - the strategy changes.  We had a lot of fun.  Too bad I had to dump her for being utterly insane! (I'm sure she was bipolar-scitzophrenic or some variant thereof).  I kept the Franklin Spelling Corrector!  Still have it to this day!"
2,"Had my doubts that this would hold a 300 page paper back book because it's kinda thick and therefore stiff... NO Problem and the adjustable part of this holder is that the two parts that actually hold the book swivel so you can move them in or out to accommodate the size of book.... SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.  I am using it to take notes for study.  Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it... could not turn the pages.  This is a winner"
2,"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback. it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it."
2,"I use this for everything from propping up cookbooks in the kitchen to reading hardcovers at my desk while eating my lunch.  Most recently I've been using it for my Kindle 2.  Works great for everything. but a little tricky for some paperbacks because they slip around a little bit.  It does work best with the average-sized hardcover (think novel- sized).  Folds up nice and fits well in a drawer or in the front pocket of my backpack.  Definitely a handy thing to have around."
2,"This is a really convenient book stand if you like to read outside of home and don't have larger books. If you don't necessarily need the portability or if you have large/tall textbooks I would suggest you look at something more study as this tends to tip over/make indentations on the bottom of pages for those books. Also you can increase the height of the stand by pulling  up part of the metal frame. but even with doing this it doesn't really support larger books well enough to easily highlight."
2,"This is as described but for some reason. I was still expecting it to be a little larger. I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices. sandwiches. cucumbers. etc.  It's the perfect size for what I wanted.  You could also use it as a form for making pancakes. etc but they would be very small!  I wouldn't use it as a cookie cutter but my family makes double the size of the average cookie.  Maybe for mini cookies this would work..."
2,"I was leery about spending tis much for the Tupperware brand name product. but I wanted to upgrade to covered ice cube trays for use in our RV and didn't feel comfortable with some of the negative reviews I read of lower cost brands (mainly the plastic cracking after a few months use).  Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit. finish. and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!  I've already gotten tossed out the original open plastic ice cube trays which were just aggravating."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
2,"I had looked high and low for a 1 ounce souffle cup and lid set for our lunchboxes.  The only ones I could find were disposable. and I strive to make our lunches completely trash free.  (See some of my other reviews)The Smidgets are the perfect size for salad dressings. little candy treats or marshmallows. raisins. nuts...if it's little. it flies!  You'll love them.  I followed the tip from another Amazon reviewer and boiled them for 1 minute then re-sealed them while they are still hot to make the lids easier to take on and off.  Worked like a charm."
2,"I take vitamins. Most containers aren't big enough to hold them. These are perfect.* They have plenty of room - I don't have to methodically arrange my vitamins to allow the lid to close. I estimate these will hold around 20 big vitamins. 9/9/11 Update: I just attached an image showing this with 16 vitamins. I think it would hold 20 if you work at it. With 16. I can just drop them in and pop the lid on.* They are compact enough to fit into a jeans pocket.Yep. the lid is hard to get off the first couple of times. No worries after that. The bonus is that a snug lid means I don't worry about them opening and spilling my vitamins. Nice!My daughter loves these in her purse. too.The uses are practically endless (aspirin. gum. paper clips. skittles :)HIGHLY Recommended!"
2,"Here in Penna. we make pickled eggs. also known here as red beet eggs.  I use this container for that.  The square shape makes it fit neatly in the back corner of my fridge.  The lid fits well; the strainer is sturdy.  I've had mine for five to ten years. and it is still good as new.  I just bought one for my mother.  She had her red beets eggs in a jar. which cracked spilling red juice all over the bottom of her firidge.  I have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh.  I think this would also work to marinate a few pieces of chicken.  I also know someone who uses hers. without the strainer. to store brown sugar.  So. it is a multi-purpose container."
2,"You most definitely get what you pay for. these are very cheap and have already started to show signs of rusting after just a couple of months.  Also look carefully at the fork and knife. they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.  The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.  The spoons are also very disproportionate if you look at the little spoon it is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I hate to say it but I was not impressed with Ikea in this case. I had to buy a whole new set to replace this one."
2,"I was doubtful about getting two sets of these. but I am glad I did.  They are just right for children.  They don't hold all that much fluid so if there is a spill...and there is ALWAYS a spill...it isn't so bad.  I put them in the dishwasher on the top shelf.  They've been holding up well.  We've had a couple left in weird places that ended up holding science experiments but they washed up just fine. Get them.  They're terrific for families."
2,"were expecting . 1st off let me say this . it's made in China . It's smaller than your average lunch box and has no lil' drink bottle inside  either . Also the latch is plastic and although it's holding i've got my doubts as to it's longevity for my grandson . The box itself is however tin and although i like that it's metal . it's unbelievable thing metal and poorly hinged with simple folded over tangs or flaps as i'd call em that link it to the other and that's for sure not all that secure . As for the pro's or positives to this lil' box . it's Curious George and all kids love or loved his cute lil' monkey shennanigans at some point and time . The artwork is pretty well done and seemingly durable thus far . The price of course was a plus and sadly i'm realizing that we've got what we've paid for ..."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
2,"I've been using this almost daily for about a month. Easy to use. easy to clean. and looks nice on the counter. No real complaints. except that the bowl feels kind of thin. like it would crack easily. I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier. I hope I'm wrong about the bowl. but I guess only time will tell. Other than that. no complaints. and I'd recommend buying this!Update 6/27/13: After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up. and it's still doing what it's supposed to do. My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube. Obviously I knew this when I purchased it. but hindsight is 20/20."
2,"I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother's feeding tube.  She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition. but does well with her customary food.  I tried using a blender. but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.  We have used the Cuisinart I purchased when they were first introduced to the USA. which worked well but was inconvenient for on-the-spot use and for travel.  I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the 'cheaper' one.  I am impressed with its performance. ease of use and compact size.  It is clearly worth the small price I paid.  I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.  It is perfect for my intended use. and I can envision how to use it in cooking. I highly recommend it."
2,"well i'm not impressed because all it is.is a mini food processor. nothing spectacular as they all work the same. I did like the fact that I could get it in a different color which was blue. I thought I would use it more but I have only used it a couple of times. I still like my bigger food processor and feel I may have wasted my money buying it. it probably would be great for an older person who doesn't need the big food processor and only needs to chop up small stuff."
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
2,"This is a good little machine with limitations.  it is very cheaply made.  no question about it.  I expect it will last a few months.  BUT. for the price I can either get it replaced or just keep buying new ones.  Not the best consumer mentality. but I think that's how it's going to be.  It IS very small.  I had anticipated making sauces with it but even for small meals you need to do it in several batches.  I tried shredding vegetables in it and it nipped away at the outer skin of it but left me with some round balls of vegetable matter that required quite a bit of shifting.  It's easy to clean and while it has quite a few drawbacks. I see this getting much more use than my larger machines because of it's overall ease."
2,"I received this as a present and was convinced I wouldn't find a use for it.  Much to my surprise I love it!  It sets on the counter next to my DLC7-Pro.  It is a whiz for chopping a cup ful of nuts for a recipe. making quick bread crumbs for meatloaf. chopping herbs and making dressings.  The blade reverses for chopping or mixing so make sure to have the side up you want for the task at hand.  It is easy to use and a breeze to clean.  I just pop the soiled parts in the dishwasher and forget it.  I would not want to be a day with out this tiny wonder."
2,"This is a MINI processor. and that's why I bought it...NOT to do the big jobs. I have the 'big boy' to do that.  I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs. so I don't have to use the big one.  I use it a lot to make home made dressing.  Clean up is easy and quick. as is the machine.  It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices. etc. however...but it states that in the manual."
2,"I bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking. It does a fairly decent job with the spices although you need to have at least 1/4 cup for it to work well. As to the herbs perhaps I'm doing something wrong but it did not do as well. The herbs that were above the blade stayed put and it took a lot of scraping the bowl to get them chopped up. An addition of something solid (perhaps an onion or a some butter) would probably take care of the problem but just the leaves on their own give this processor a hard time."
2,"I have had this cuisinart for about 2 years now. and it is still going strong.  I have been impressed by its ability to chew through large volumes of basil when making pesto. and small things like sesame seeds for making tahini.  It is also perfect for grinding cookies for pie crusts.  And the size means you don't have to be using a large volume to get great results.  I don't think this mini prep eliminates the usefulness of a full-size cuisinart. but it sure is much easier to clean up when you only need to process 1-2 cups of something."
2,"I find it a little difficult to get the get the consistency I want.  Some things get liquefied if the chunks are too big and I want to try for a little smaller.  What I wind up with is liquid -- but still with some chunks in it!  That. for me is not too bad; I just wanted it for small amounts where hand slicing/chopping wouldn't do the job.  I have had the Cuisinart Mini-Prep for three-and-a-half years and used it again. tonight. for the first time in two years!  Then I remembered why I had not used it.  The parts have too many small grooves and recesses which just do not wash cleanly -- easily.  After brushing and scrubbing the disassembled parts I find that to get off all the small smears of food I have to resort to Q-Tips to get the numerous little. tight angles and grooves clean.  It's a  hygiene horror!"
2,"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers. and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position. so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well. the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine. so it's useless.On top of the danger. it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!"
2,"I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming. A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s. That one lasted around 12 years(!!!) I just burned-out my second one: and now I'm here to buy my third! It's very easy to operate. even for a quad!!It really works fast and the processing mechanism is made well. I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds. and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy."
2,"Then go with the Ninja Master Prep. I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant. so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed. but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades. two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit."
2,"I wore out my original one. so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads. and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad. I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor. and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you. and I like small pieces of carrot in salads. not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces. dressing. and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one. except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking."
2,"I love this little guy!  I use it for just about everything!  I make salad dressing all the time. and yesterday I made topping for a cherry crumble.  Easy to use. easy to clean!  I never put any of the parts in the dishwasher. I think its ok to do so. but from past experience. these sort of items tend to wear out more quickly if they are subject to the heat of dishwasher drying. so I don't do it.  This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.  Great for gifts too!"
2,"Cuisinart. I thought. built quality products. Then they started manufacturing this mess that they call a blender. What a stretch to call it a blender! It needs help to puree the ingredients for a smoothie (you must frequently STIR the ingredients yourself.) The blade assembly eventually cracked. There is now a black residue around the black whirly thing on the base. My husband thinks that it over heated. All that damage from making SMOOTHIES?! Yep. Cuisinart take note-I AM NOT BUYING CUISINART PRODUCTS AGAIN. I would venture to guess others feel the same. I'm happy that some folks had a good experience with this 'blender' but I am not one of them."
2,"In my humble opinion. most of blenders are not great.  The motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit. I've burned through a couple of cheap Hamilton Beach ones.  So if you are doing a lot of entertaining. you might want to look at a commercial one.Use your head.  You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down. Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients. Also. you should look at the recipe book.  The recipe book gives you hints on how to 'layer' the ingredients.I made some awesome hummus by following their directions.As I said earlier. if you are doing heavy blending work with ice you may need a professional unit.  I have heard some of the high end Warings fit the bill."
2,"I'd lower my number of stars. but can't because this is an edit of a previous review.  I had this blender for four years (an admittedly long time. but I used it very rarely).  I noticed after a year or so that there were fine black plastic bits on the base of the blender.  After a few more years of use the plastic mechanism in the base of the unit that spins the blades split in two.My husband and I were going to throw it in the trash. but then felt a wave of guilt about how in our consumeristic culture we never repair things anymore. etc.  So he went online and ordered the broken part for $[...].  When he tried to replace it we realized that an interior screw had become stripped and it was impossible to remove the broken piece.  THEN we threw it in the trash and bought an Osterizer. which doesn't have any plastic moving parts."
2,"I love the blender portion.  It works great at crushing ice and other items.  The food processor is another story.  Works to chop up and blend items. but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it.  With each use. the noise is louder and so irritating.  I am extremely disappointed that I can't use the processor portion of it.  As much as I love the blender. I can't recommend the purchase because you won't be able to use the processor without ear plugs."
2,"This blender replaced a Sunbeam I had for 30 years.  The jar is oversized and supported by small blades placed in a small opening at the base of vessel. isolated from the mass inside. It takes forever to blend anything smooth.  After operating the motor for more than a few moments it begins to emit a strong burning smell.  The plastic drive assembly for the blades snapped off in the first week of use.  Cuisinart replaced one free.  The second one cost about twenty dollars.  I would not recommend this blender. there are better choices."
2,"This is a great blender that's gotten a bad rap. I've owned this model for years and it outperforms all others for my specific task: pureeing Progresso's Manhattan Clam Chowder. The ice crushers don't liquefy the clam pieces. The Cuisinart purees their little hearts out. The mechanical construction is still the Achilles heel but if I can get 2-3 years daily service for 59 bucks. I'm good.Btw. Progresso Manhattan Clam Chowder is a watery mess from the can. Once it's throughly blended. like a shrimp bisque. it's a world class soup. I'd put it up against anything in a top restaurant. I've had one can a day for twenty years. Unfortunately. this doesn't work for other Progresso soups (they're already too thick). Another stroke of genius: blending pea soup with vegetable soup. but this only works for mid-price restaurant soups."
2,"Worked great for the three months that it functioned.  I liked the glass jar and it made great smoothies.  It was powerful and never bogged down.  Then it just quit working.  It is made in China and of apparently poor quality.  Too expensive to buy one every three months.  I would look for something with better reviews.I changed my review on this from one star to four stars because the manufacturer stands by there product.  They replaced the blender with no hassles.  However. it still broke after three months so you should be careful."
2,"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry). we did not have 'proof of purchase' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer 'service' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service."
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
2,"Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker. With a only 6 months of service. the grind mechanism bound and couldn't be removed. Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee (I did have to pay shipping charges!) Less than a year later a repeat performance. Again. I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine. Well you know what happened!  The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita's!"
2,"I've had two of these machines.  The first one lasted almost 2 years and made outstanding coffee.  The second one makes absolutely terrible coffee.  I have come to the conclusion that this second machine doesn't get the water hot enough so the coffee is weak and bitter no matter what I do.  The temp in the carafe at the conclusion of brewing is only 150 degrees.  I spent so much time and money thinking it was my error. but now I'm fairly sure it isn't my fault.If you get a good one it's great. but the one I have now makes undrinkable coffee.  I bought a refurbished one the second time around. I'll never make that mistake again.  There's a reason why those products are so much cheaper."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
2,"This coffee maker makes good coffee. but all the little parts. which don't fit together quite right will make you crazy.  This is a pain to clean.  The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove.  After a few months. I couldn't get it out. even with a pliers.  Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off. when trying to remove the basket.  I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response.  Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good.  In the trash it goes.  The machine also 'beeps' at you a lot....like I need one more complaint!  Good coffee. but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement."
2,"FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder. be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer."
2,"I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range. It does take longer to clean. I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts. I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away. One should use soap vs. just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils. Then if I want a second pot. I either use the other set of parts or if both sets are wet. I dry the pieces with a couple of papertowels. This probably takes 2-4 minutes. I think it's worth the time."
2,"The idea of a machine that ground &amp; brewed coffee was too good to resist. and for a while it was fine (althought it's noise scared the heck out of my dog);  within the first year the heating element croaked.  Sent it back &amp; got a replacement unit. which incidentally only is warranteed for the balance of the first unit's warranty!  6 months later. today. with a full pot of coffee on board. it burst into flame!  Whoa! Fortunately my husband was in the kitchen and took care of it before the house went up. I'm going back to Braun. no question!!"
2,"Worked great for the first year we had it. when we used it maybe 3-4 times.But after that. it seemed like nothing would ever really freeze up enough. I looked into the problem and decided that I might have damaged the cooling capability of the bowl by cleaning it with hot water (which is a no-no).So. I bought a replacement bowl. and once again. for the first year with a few uses it seemed to be OK.But now once again. it's just not getting cold enough - and this time I *know* it's not my fault since I have been very careful to only wash the bowl in cold water."
2,"I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot. Although it is super easy to use. it is not really a practical gadget for regular use. The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance. The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath. Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors. dieters. or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar). I usually make mango ice cream in it. In addition to ice-cream. it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks. In  that case you will want to get an extra canister."
2,"I really wanted to love this ice cream maker.  I was Somersizing and wanted to use the all natural ice cream mixes that went along with the diet.  I could get my ice cream to freeze- that wasn't a problem. It was like wonderful soft serve in the middle of the bowl.  However. all along the edges of the bowl it was frozen rock solid and NOTHING was going to remove the ice cream from around it.  The ring of rock hard ice cream wasn't just a small skim. it was a substantial amount.  Sadly. this has spent more time hidden in the depths of my cabinets than being used."
2,"My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago. My husband and I are vegan. so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes. (I eventually started compiling them in my blog. A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.)We've never had a problem with the machine. Every recipe I've invented has frozen nicely. I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time. so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe. because it can be a pain to clean. especially when I'm using a high-fat coconut milk. Still. it's not too difficult. and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it."
2,"Once I got the hang of it (there is a bit of a learning curve. but it's not terribly steep). I loved the frozen treats that I could make - especially frozen yogurt.A few weeks ago. while it was mid way thru churning. the upper. cylindrical part of the dasher snapped away from the vertical. scraping arm.  Because the machine is out of warranty. I had to order the part's replacement at my own expense.  While it's not going to break the bank. Cuisinart informed me that it would take 8 weeks (!) to fill my order.I'd considered ordering the dasher that was introduced in the newer model. since it's supposed to be more efficient. but I wasn't sure that it would fit in the ICE-20.Bottom Line:  Great concept. lousy parts."
2,"This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.  No more messing with salt and ice cubes--this maker has a special bowl that you keep in the freezer that freezes the ingredients (mine is always frozen so whenever I want to make ice cream I can). This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make 'frozen ANYTHING' with this maker.  Did you know that you could make frozen pudding? The ice cream technique that Cuisinart has perfected of a constant scraping of the sides of the bowl assures that your ice cream is super smooth too. Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.  Great machine!  I've had mine for about six years and use it about once a month and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it."
2,"First let me start by saying I was a little skeptical of ice cream makers. The ones we had when we were kids required dry ice and lots of time. neither of which I have.  This is the best though.  The ice cream is so good and really easy.  I've only had this ice cream maker 4 days and I've already made vanilla. chocolate and strawberry ice cream and peach frozen yogurt and each one is delicious.  It makes the perfect amount for a family. not too much so you're sick of it before it's gone or too little.  And it's so easy.  Basically you just pour the ingredients in while it's mixing and in 30 minutes you have ice cream."
2,"I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock. and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all. but I've really been craving sorbet. and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix. but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours. only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up."
2,"I have had an old Donvier manual model for 30 years. so I'm used to using a chiller bowl.  However. there's no comparison between hand turning the paddle in the Donvier model and letting the Cuisinart do it's thing. I love the fact that the chiller turns and the paddle is stationary.I leave the chiller in the freezer for 1-2 days and make sure my ice cream bases are nice and cold as well.  My ice cream is ready in about 12-13 minutes.  So easy. creamy. fast and smooth. Love. love. love this Cuisinart.I debated on whether to get the 2 qt model or the 1 1/2. My old Donvier makes 2 qts. I opted for the 1 1/2 qt and find that's plenty of ice cream.  Thinking about buying a 2nd chiller for times when I do want to make more than 1 1/2 qts or when I want to make 2 different types of ice cream on the same day.So glad I bought this!Farewell Donvier!"
2,"I had never in my life had homemade ice cream until now. my husband and I bought this as a Christmas present to the both of us. we have everything else you can think of but never an ice cream maker. well we are so impressed with the ice cream we can't wait to try other types. It is without a doubt the best tasting ice cream I have ever had. and this machine makes it so easy to make. just pour in the ingredients and turn it on. set a timer and you can relax. when it is done transfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and let it harden and you have the best tasting ice cream ever! Try it. you will love it!"
2,"I had used an old ice cream maker for years. but got tired of the ice and salt mess. so was using the maker less and less. Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews. I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok. especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well. let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold. it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency. but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!"
2,"We've had this Cuisinart ice cream maker for several months now and have made many different flavors of ice cream.  Without exception the product has been excellent.  I've read some earlier reviews where the reviewer had a problem with the ice cream being too soft.  We have neve experienced this problem.  When it is initially finished it is not as hard as when purchased in a store.  However. merely by placing in the freezer. where ice cream belongs in the first place. it hardens to regular consistency.  Perhaps the reason is that we use the Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream book (available from Amazon).I could not expect or experience a better product for making any kind of ice cream."
2,"I make Raw Cream Ice Cream twice a week.  It works great.  It makes 6 cups.  I need 2 for parties.  Don't over fill and run till it's hard and it's firmer than soft serve.I get 5 cups of cream per gallon of Raw Milk. straight from the mamma cow.  I add 6 Raw Free-Range Egg Yokes. a 1/4 cup of Maple Syrup. 2 1/2 tablespoons of Vanilla Extract and 1 tablespoon of Psyllium Husks.  It's so healthy.  I consider it medicine for my 3 year boy.I find that it does stick to the bowl some.  It's not a problem unless you put it back in the freezer with ice cream in it.  I only do that when I'm leaving soon after making ice cream.  It's not totally quiet. but what do you expect from a motor.  It's quieter than the old salt and ice type."
2,"I received this for my bridal shower.  I tried it to make sure it worked before I lost the gift receipt.  It is so easy to use.  I made up a batch of ingredients to make vanilla frozen yogurt.  It was quick and easy to assemble.  I poured the liquid in and off it went for 20-25 minutes.  It was louder then I anticipated. but nothing crazy.  It froze perfectly and tasted wonderful.  I am looking forward to making more delicious ice creams. sorbets. sherbets. frozen yogurts. and even frozen slushy drinks.  This thing is awesome.  It seems pretty darn solid and it easy to clean."
2,"I bought this for me last summer. and I loved it so much. I bought another as a gift.  It's easy. taste so much better than anything you can buy. and it's fun to be creative.  We never have left over icecream sitting in the freezer now. and when we want some. I keep cream handy in the fridge. so we just toss the ingredients into a blender. pour it into the already frozen bowl. and 'Voila' 30 minutes later we have icecream !!!  Fastest dessert I've ever made. and always a big hit.  Great way to use up ripe bananas. and make banana split ice cream."
2,"I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice cream maker and would highly recommend it to anyone. I have made countless different recipes in it. and this machine makes creamy ice cream in mere minutes. I have also partly frozen the ice cream and then layered a combination of flavors creating a stunning semifredo dessert. When you can get Cuisinart quality at such a reasonable price. why pay more? The only problem I had was that the ice cream was so good I wanted to make more shortly after and the freezer bowl had not completely frozen again. An additional freezer bowl is on my Christmas wish list this year!"
2,"I bought this because I love ice cream and can't have many of the 'preservatives' in store brands and I can't afford the price of high end natural ice creams. Thinking worse case scenario the grandkids would love it I made my first batch of ice cream using fat free half and half. it was amazing!As for the noise it makes. I discovered that setting it on a folded towel on the counter cuts down on the noise alot. My husbands plan is setting it up in the laundry room. closing the door and setting a time. lol that works too.I usually only have to place container in the frezer for 6 hours before using it so I think freezing time depends on type of freezer and settings.What I like teh most is how easy it is to make ice cream and the clean up is also fast and easy.I'm getting each of my adult children one for Christmas gifts this year."
2,"Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [...]and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it. my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one. so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced"
2,"i gave this to my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it. once you put all the stuff in the bowl it only takes 15 minutes. though it should be noted that it then needs a few hours in the freezer to freeze up fully and that many recipes require a little prior prepping. i still think this is the easiest one you will find and it's a big plus to not need ice or salt. very easy to clean and there is an opening at the top so you can watch it work. very cool."
2,"Awesome product... just make sure that your freezer bowl is frozen solid... leave it in your freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 days between ice cream batches just to be sure.  Also. you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine.  My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been.  Other than that. its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream.  If you really like ice cream or have a large family. you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl.  The ice cream will go fast!"
2,"I received this item for Christmas.  I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives.  I used a simple recipe from off the web: Some whole milk. condesed milk. and cocoa powder.  At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours.  It didn't swish when I shook it. so I thought I was good to go.  After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants.  I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning.  After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had.  I will never buy ice cream from the store again.  This ice cream maker is awesome. I love it."
2,"We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make 'Ice Cream' with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.  We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry 'ice cream' using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first."
2,"Highly recommended! I LOVE this ice cream maker. It's so easy and the results are amazing. I like GOOD ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs)and this machine creates stellar ice cream. It rivals any of the best ice cream you can find. Even the basic recipes produce excellent ice cream. I've made mint chip. premium vanilla bean and strawberry. I do recommend using quality dairy products for best results (I use Organic Valley milk and heavy cream). Sorry. Haagen-Dazs. I won't be buying any more ice cream from you!"
2,"This is a very simple machine that does what it's supposed to with very little fuss.  I put the frozen bowl part in our upright freezer at least a few hours before I expect to make ice cream.  I make the custard for the ice cream at the same time.  After dinner. I put the frozen part on the stand. put in the mixing blade and top with the lid.  Then I pour the custard in and 20-30 minutes later we enjoy fresh ice cream with no additives.  If you want ice cream that is harder than soft serve. it will need to 'ripen' a bit more in your freezer.  But this is a delightful machine that I highly recommend.  I never made ice cream before it. and never want to buy it from a grocery again."
2,"This product is getting great reviews for good reason. Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way. First. freeze the bowl overnight. Second. chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled. Use pure vanilla. not imitation vanilla extract. In doing both of these things. I've found I've been able to create soft serve ice cream. which I then freeze for a couple of hours for a hard serve. In not doing these things. I've found that I create milkshakes. and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants. To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie. Amazingly. the recipes in the instruction manual show sorbet and frozen yogurt are on par calorically with homemade ice cream at about 215 calories per 1/2 cup serving. Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly. and I'll experiment with those recipes."
2,"This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours. I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours. At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture. Obviously it was not frozen enough. At 12 hours. I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen. This may not be an issue for everyone. but with our freezer and our bowl it takes a good 20 to 24 hours of the bowl being in the freezer to get the icecream just right."
2,"I actually have the red model with 2 freezer inserts.  It's a very simple machine with only 4 parts and is easy to clean.  The only thing you have to remember is to keep the freezer inserts in the freezer and that the ice cream will be soft when finished churning.  I put my finished ice cream in containers in the freezer and they're ready to eat in a couple of hours.  I wasn't all that happy with the recipes I found in the booklet (didn't want to use heavy cream or cook the base) but there are skazillions of recipes on line and after some trial and error I made up my own.  I saw some people complained of the noise. but it's not all that loud and it only churns for 30 minutes.  Here's the link to my ice cream recipe (makes 2 inserts worth of ice cream) if you're interested.  [...]  I am very happy with this purchase."
2,"I bought this ice cream maker after I took an Ice Cream. Gelato and Sorbet class at Sur La Table cooking store.  Because we were making so many different types of desserts. we had several ice cream makers working in the classroom at the same time.  This ice cream maker was by far my favorite that day and I bought it about a week later.I liked the ease of adding ingredients through the opening on the top and the size is perfect for me.I have used my new ice cream maker with no problems.  The bowl froze easily (probably in less than 24 hours) in the bottom and back of the freezer.  Within about 20 minutes. I had wonderfully frozen ice cream.I certainly plan on getting more adventurous with my ingredients and do not anticipate any problems with this wonderful machine."
2,"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also. I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender. pour it into the frozen bowl. turn it on. & 25 minutes later. you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night."
2,"I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go. I really like how fast it makes ice cream. I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out. Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl. So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream. The texture is just right when its finished. I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer. So I put it into individual portions and that way I don't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy"
2,"I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use. makes great ice cream. and the design is simple. so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price. and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content. you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this. I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use. easy to clean. simple design. great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space"
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
2,"Without a doubt. this is a great appliance!  Mine was a gift. but Amazon's price is the best (as is the service).  It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer.  Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid.  Perhaps their freezers need adjusting?  In fact. after making ice cream (about 20 minutes) my bowl is still mostly frozen.Recipes do not seem to be as important as when baking. so don't be afraid to try something innovative.  Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it. then improvise.We are healthy eaters.  It's nice to know the ingredients I'm using are healthy.  It's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun!"
2,"I and my family have had a blast with this ice cream maker! We have been making up some of our own recipes as well as using those supplied with the machine and some from Ben & Jerry's recipe book. The savings over store bought ice cream is phenomenal too. I only have one small exception to our 'eye blasting red' ice cream maker (and it is indeed a small exception). It could be perhaps be a bit quieter... On the other hand. it is readily apparent by the change in the 'noise' the machine makes. that your delectable treat is ready to decant!GET IT. MAKE IT. LOVE IT...  then do it again!"
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"I just received this yesterday. and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt.  I was a little apprehensive. since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.  My first batch worked flawlessly!  The machine was quiet. operated smoothly. and it was soooo simple!  I am going to buy an extra freezing cannister so we can do two batches back-to-back.  We've been using our old electric rock salt machine. but now we'll probably get rid of it.  Also. due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker. we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.  I recommend it."
2,"Can I say more?  Well. this neat little ice cream maker doesn't take up much space on the counter when in use &amp; stores easily -- the base is no wider in diameter than a dinner plate.  The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid. After having it in the freezer overnight. when it's thoroughly frozen. you put it on the base. fill it with the ingredients for whatever flavor of ice cream you desire. put the mixing blade in and the top on then flip the switch. About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple. You can cover the original container and slip it in the freezer for later. or you can dish it out and wash and refreeze the container -- it is very easy to clean. Also. by the way. it's the best ice cream you'll ever have. Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry."
2,"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar. but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said. you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir. and then take the freezer bowl out. cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great. I have very little problem with ice crystals forming."
2,"I've had my Cuisinart ice cream maker for 5 years now and am still delighted with it!  I even bought an extra freezer bowl in case I want to make 2 flavors the same day.  I do make sure to stop the freezer after 20-25 minutes of operation or the ice cream will start to soften.  And I learned early on to chill the ingredients OVERNIGHT or the ice cream won't freeze - just gets thick.  But it's a great item. and doesn't take up much space on the counter. I'm especially happy with it since I can't eat regular ice cream because of lactose intolerance.  So I use liquid nondairy creamer to make ice cream in this freezer and it's very satisfactory!"
2,"... is home-made ice cream. I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit. No mess. quick. easy. home made ice cream. Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted. Great for frozen drinks. too. including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction. powerful motor. It's noisy but not too much.The ice cream from this (or any) ice cream maker comes out soft serve. but it's really true. if you put the ice cream in the freezer for another 1-2 hours. it hardens to the exact same consistency as store-bought ice cream. It's surprising the first time you try this. because you think it'll come out solid like a block of ice. but it doesn't - it's soft but scoopable."
2,"I ordered the Cuisinart Ice Cream maker after reading all of the reviews on Amazon and it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  To be honest. I thought that making home-made ice cream would be just too  difficult. but with the Cuisinart. I've made it three times in the past  week.  You simple mix-up the ingredients. chill. and then pour into the  pre-frozen bowl.  Perfect every time.  I highly recommend the book.  &quot;Gelato! : Italian Ice Cream. Sorbetti &amp; Granite&quot; by Pamela  Sheldon Johns as a great add-on.  I ordered the book with the hope of being  able to duplicate the Stracciatella(?) Gelato I had while on vacation in  Italy.  The recipe was simple (heavy cream. milk. sugar. vanilla. and  shaved chocolate) and the results were fabulous.This machine would  make a great gift as well!"
2,"Soft serve at best is what this unit does. I followed the instructions to the letter. The freezer container was kept at 0 degrees for &#62;24 hours. The mix was kept in the frid for 6 hours to hopefully assist in keeping things cold. The unit works well and within 15 minutes I had a nice batch of soft serve. However all the unit does is save you the trouble of mixing the batch by hand. I think Ice Cream means it shouldn't flow out of the container until it melts. This it pour-able into a dish. On a hot day of say 85 degrees. this wouldn't last long enough to lick a cone of it before it was running down your arm. I can deal with hand mixing from now on and placing the batch in the freezer and waiting."
2,"This was a good purchase and the recipe book is great! I've made half of them now; some were awesome. some good. some didn't work. The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so. which I found strange. An ice cream maker shouldn't get hot! The ice cream is still really yummy. but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks. Overall. for $60. it does the job and there haven't been any major problems!"
2,"I ordered this RED ice cream maker to give to my husband's daughter and family for Christmas along with a RED quesadilla maker.  I ordered the Cuisinart because a friend has the stainless one and really brags about it - makes ice cream 2 or 3 times a week - says it is EASY and GOOD!  I just know that they will have a great family time together making ice cream with the RED ice cream maker and the color couldn't be any better for a Christmas gift!  And - yes - I shop early so there's not such a rush around Christmas time!"
2,"LOVE this ice cream maker.  I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are. Doesn't take up much room. It's the perfect size for my husband and me.  Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.  IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things. like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.  I admit I wasn't sure it would work the first time. it seemed too easy. but sure enough in 25 minutes we were in ice cream heaven.  We like to transfer the ice cream to a tupperware container and stick it in the freezer for an hour or so before eating so it's firmer. but if we can't wait....  I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.  We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something."
2,"Yes. upfront I'll say it's a little noisy. but that kind of goes with the territory.  Works perfectly. just as described in the directions.  I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.  It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.  Makes great ice cream. ice milk. bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.  Once you do that you may never make it any other way.  Once you price the ingredients. I cannot honestly say making ice cream is all that much cheaper than buying it. but the quality is far superior to store bought. and you have the added bonus of knowing exactly what is in your ice cream."
2,"I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far.  3 were from the manual that came with the machine. and one was from the internet.  All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture.  The ice cream was not creamy and melty. it was either icy or fudgy.  I like the machine. it is easy to use. but also quite loud.  We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned.  I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people don't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well.  The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream. but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it."
2,"This Product turned out to be what I expected based on other's reviews.but it does what it says if you follow the directions carefully.The only thing is that it does not get the ice cream to a solid texture.like soft serve as other's have said.so you can freeze it more within a few hours if preferred as I did.It is slightly noisy but it does not bother me.sound can be compared to a blow dryer on low perhaps but not exact.Other than that minor issue it works pretty good and I intend to use it plenty.also I was glad to purchase it in my favorite color red."
2,"Makes ice cream! I am on a no carb diet.. but I didn't want to give up my favorite frozen treat. This makes ice cream.. takes maybe 20 minutes.. the ice cream holder itself requires about 24hrs to freeze prior to use. You can of course use it before 24 hours.. but its more like a milkshake.. which is also fine  :)I have never used an ice cream maker before this one. My boyfriend has a self refrigerating one.. he said this one is A LOT quieter.I love it."
2,"Will never buy ice cream again!!  At first was hesitant bytthe few negative reviews.  Bought one two days ago and bought a load of milk and supplies cause figured it would take 5 or 6 times to get it right.  have made 4 ice creams already.  So far they have all turned out GREAT!  have always loved soft serve better.  used mostly the recipes that came with the machine except that being lactose intolerant. i used lactaid milk and also used baking splenda instead of sugar.  It worked out fine. But. i did make sure all the ingredients were real cold before i put them into the machine.  and also i put the 2 bowls into the chest freezer in plastic bags.  We are real happy with this for sure."
2,"We were initially disappointed with this machine.  We tried recipes out of the booklet that came with it. the Ben & Jerry's book and another source.  The ice cream was just OK.  Something along the line of what we could pick up at the local convenience store.  Then we tried the recipe out of Christopher Kimball's The Desert Bible.  Hallelujah!  Creamy. rich. just what we had hoped for.We had a similar experience with our bread machine.  Mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook.  So. don't blame the machine too quickly.  The fault may lie in the recipe book."
2,"I bought this because my son was diagnosed with a dairy allergy.  I wanted to be able to provide ice cream without breaking the bank.  There are new coconut milk ice creams available but at $6 a pint I could pay for this unit in a hurry.  I buy my Thai brand Coconut Milk (not lite) from Walmart at $1.42 per can.  You just freeze the cylander. add 2 cans of coconut milk. a little sugar. vanilla and whatever else you want to flavor and let it go.  1/2 hour later I had what looked like soft serve ice cream.  My children were so thrilled!"
2,"If you think that you cannot make good ice cream without the rock salt and a ton of ice. well you should check out this Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker!  It is so easy and convenient to use. and in 20-25 minutes you have soft serve ice cream.  If you want to freeze it hard. just put it in the freezer for awhile if there is any left after you taste your results over and over again!  Also. if you make a lot of ice cream. be sure to pick up the extra freezer container.  Keep one in the freezer at all times and you are never caught without one that is ready to go!"
2,"I've only used this once so far. but it's pretty awesome.  You just pour in your pre-mixed. chilled ingredients. press start. and set a kitchen timer.  20-30 minutes later. the ice cream comes out like soft serve. which is great. but you can pour it into a freezer container and firm it up if you'd like. (which I did because it was for a birthday party later in the day).  My only complaint is that it's a little noisy.  I wouldn't recommend running it while you're trying to watch a movie or something.  I'm looking forward to using this more when the weather warms up here in Michigan."
2,"This is very easy to use; it's just like another small appliance you can use on your counter top.  It does a good job. except that a hard frozen layer forms around the sides and needs to be scraped down about halfway through.I'm updating this since I've had it a few more months.  It still works great. and I've been able to experiment more.  Even if I don't get the recipie just right. it freezes just fine.  I use frozen berries to make sorbets with less sugar (high fructose corn syrup) than the grocery store kinds.  I've also made a batch of very rich vanilla (with eggs carefully cooked) and it came out wonderful."
2,"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list. and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was 'awesome.' I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise. but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet. but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender."
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
2,"This is my second summer using the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker. and it's never let me down.  Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite.  As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home. when the ice cream is done. it will . . . still be soft. but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable.  Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer.'  My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy. but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch--not too long to vacate the kitchen."
2,"I love this machine.  A cousin had tried a couple of other brands including one about 4 times more expensive and had to return both of them. so I read the reviews very carefully.  This one is easy to use and it works.  I followed the instructions exactly. The ice cream is great.  I did freeze the ice cream for an additional 2 hours after it was mixed as the manual suggests.  Works perfectly. Yumm  It doesn't make a lot. just a little over two pints."
2,"This machine is very easy to use.  It comes with a handy little recipe book to help you with your first few recipes.  One thing you must do is  freeze the bowl for a good 24 hours the first time. then you will want to  cover the bowl in plastic (to prevent freezer flavors tainting the bowl).  and leave it in your freezer.  You will be making home made ice cream in  about 20 minutes.  The consistancy is good. and it is delicous.  Best of  all. you will not be adding any strange presevatives. or anything you do  not want.  Ben and Jerry's has an excellent recipe book that you can get  here at amazon. and you will be making up tasty ice cream in no time!"
2,"I got one of these ice cream makers as a Christmas gift. and it's been fantastic. I was careful before requesting it to check the temperature of my freezer. If your freezer doesn't maintain a temperature of between 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit. your ice cream probably won't turn out that well. Mine stays at a chilly zero degrees. and I've been amazed at how quickly this machine makes great frozen desserts. I've made the full-fat ice creams. a couple of sherbets. and frozen yogurt -- everything froze quickly and evenly. and came out with fantastic texture and flavor. It's been a great gift. I keep the bowl in the freezer. wrapped in a plastic bag and filled with frozen vegetables. so it's always ready to go."
2,"I bought this for my son for his birthday.  Wow. is it easy and delicious.  A person could be in real trouble with this ice cream maker sitting around.We first made the vanilla recipe and it was better than wonderful...just a few ingredients into the bowl and away you go.  Fat City is on the horizon.  I love it.  Thank goodness my son lives 1000 miles away or I would be in real trouble with this little machine.  The price is good and the ice cream is wonderful.  Wonderful gift."
2,"I just got this machine and made the strawberry ice cream recipe that came with it.  Ben and Jerry. eat your heart out.  This is so easy there's no reason to ever eat store bought ice cream again.  No locust bean gum. no artificial color. no preservatives - and you can make it with organic ingredients if you want.  The ice cream tastes awesome. and I would recommend this machine to anyone. especially those who cannot use a hand crank machine. or don't want the fuss and muss of using salt."
2,"I read many of the reviews before buying this ice cream maker. and the reviewers were right!  It's a great little machine...I don't think it's that noisy (no more so than a food processor).  I love it - I do agree that the recipes that come with it are not great. but there are lots of wonderful recipes out there.  This is fast. easy. and no worries about salt and ice running all over make it much more likely I will continue to use it quite often!"
2,"I have always used my kitchen aid attachment for ice cream and am very happy with it; however. we don't eat a lot of ice cream and the Kitchen Aid bowl was too big.  I picked this up when I read some great reviews and I am very pleased.  The ice cream maker is very easy to use and while not as quiet as I hoped for. it doesn't take long to get great ice cream.  Note that what you first end up with is more soft serve which we really enjoy but after a few hours in the freezer you have more of an ice cream texture.  Great product - Cuisinart never lets me down!"
2,"I've just gotten this machine and have made the basic vanilla ice cream twice. Both times were a total sucess!  The ice cream is delicious!  No more ice and salt mess! Preparation time is quick and easy! The machine is a little noisy. however. no big deal. It was facinating watching it thicken up for the final result. Time in the freezer is usually needed after it's done.  That's the hardest part....the waiting!  Clean up time is quick as well! Looking forward to trying the other recipes in the booklet. I'm sure they'll be just as tasty.  I highly recommend this machine!!  I know that we'll be having home made ice cream a lot more often now!"
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
2,"I connected some quick disconnect fittings to this Y fitting. Two of the openings in this Y were the right size. but one opening was too large. I had to cut slots in the rim of the opening and use a hose clamp to bring the size down to the correct diameter. I verified the opening diameter with several other fittings and calipers to see that the one opening was indeed bigger than the normal size.This item will normally work great if you are connecting hose directly to it. but use caution when connecting other items to it.Plastic will change shape after it has been injected and cools (like this product). Good engineering and good chemical composition will compensate for those changes. I recommend getting a different brand product instead of this one if you want quality and consistency."
2,"I use the TN311C heavy-duty grounded timer to control the ON-OFF cycle of a dehumidifier.  I actually bought two units - the 2nd one as a back-up - and. removed all of the 'ON' and 'OFF' trippers from the back-up unit to use on this one.  This gives me 6 ON-OFF cycles. and it works perfectly with our dehumidifier.  I've set the timer to turn ON the dehumidifier for 2 hours and then OFF for 2 hours throughout the day and night.  It keeps our area perfectly dehumidified. and the humidity rise is only 4% to 5% during the OFF cycle.I would recommend this timer to anyone considering a use similar to mine."
2,"I have used a number of these for years with no problems whatsoever.  However I realized that the timers use more power than some of my lights!  I have a 4 Watt night light which we run all night in the hallway and the timer draws 5 Watts - 24x7.  That was bad enough. but then I replaced the 4 Watt night light with an LED bulb that draws 1/2 watt or so.  It was way cheaper to run that 24x7 then to use a timer to 'save money' and have it only on at night.  I have thrown these all away and purchased digital timers - they pay for themselves in energy savings."
2,"I've bought 2 of these exact same ones. one is still working & the other one went bad after3 or 4 years so that seemed reasonable.This one i just got yesterday from amazon doesn't work. The dial turns but it gets stuckat the pins. I noticed another reviewer had the same problem so I'm here to buy another brand.UPDATE: After i wrote the above I took the unit and kept spinning the dial to loosen it up.I plugged it back in & found it WOULD now turn on but not OFF. So i repeated spinning the dial over & over & finally. now it's working properly."
2,"I'd had these timers for years and had no problems. so the issue is not with the timer itself. BUT now that I have a TODDLER. these really can't be used anymore. since she finds it fun to pull out the little plastic pieces that are needed to set the timer. Not only is this a choking hazard (however minor). but once the pieces are gone. the timer is useless! CAUTION WITH DIGITAL TIMERS. TOO. THOUGH (though I'll have to try them again): We had a power surge. and all of the timers got ruined (and we tried to change the batteries - no help)! SO. OVERALL A GOOD PRODUCT AND MORE RELIABLE THAN DIGITAL TIMERS. but NOT good if you have toddlers!"
2,"This is a nice window fan with good power and not too noisy. adaptable to different window sizes if you need to move it. However. the sliding panels are flimsy and don't move smoothly; the fasteners that are used to clamp the panels in place are cheap and can easily be unscrewed and fall out.  The single knob control works fine but the settings are hard to see; you will end up turning it by click or fan noise to the desired power or direction. Well-packaged in the box."
2,"This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues. but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy. but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws. so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you. put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable. but it exhausts air much better than it draws air. and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed. which is how we run it anyway."
2,"I have a Lasko fan that I bought around 1989 which still runs and I live in an apartment on the second floor that gets very hot in the summer so I decided to get another fan to have cross ventilation. I am really pleased with my purchase. this fan is lighter and easier to place in the window and you don't need to screw it in the window for it to stay in. It is much quieter than the older fan even on high speed and doesn't shake in the window like the older model does.I like the fan so much that I plan on purchasing another one next month and give the older model to a friend."
2,"We raise & show rabbits so we bought this fan for our rabbit barn because the ammonia smell was getting really bad in there & we needed something to pull that smell out. The barn isn't real big so there's wasn't enough air flow in there with only 1 window & 1 door so... needless to say we are VERY pleased with this exhaust fan!!! We keep the fan on exhuast 24/7 & you would never know that rabbits lived in there! It gets the smell out seconds after turning it on. I love that you can put it in the window & still be able to close the window behind it during bad weather. I was surprised at how inexpensive this fan was too! Definitely worth buying! & If something were to happen to the one we have we will definitely be buying another one!"
2,"I searched for an exhaust fan for our new. hot garage.  I did not believe some of the negative reviews and neither should you!  This fan fit right into our garage window and has been working every day for months!  Who cares if it is not made out of a heavy metal; you don't have to touch it except to turn it off and on.  It pulls and exhausts a lot of air and that is what it is supposed to do.  Don't make life more complicated then it has to be.  With all my searching. Amazon gave me the best deal and with my rewards from my Amazon credit card the fan cost me $54.  What's not to like when other stores wanted as much as $110?"
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
2,"This fan is a good fan but does not move the amount of air I want to move.  I usually put a fan at one end of the house then open my bedroom window and have the fan pull in cool air at night.  this somewhat does the  job but really not enough.  I might be asking for too much for its size etc.  I like the fact that it is reversable and it is adjustable to fit wide or narrow windows.  If you are using it for one room this is a good fan but not great for the whole house (I have a small house 1500 sq ft).  I'd give it a try and see if it works for you."
2,"These are great fans--I bought one for the upstairs hall. and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home.  WIth both of them running on exhaust. the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night.  There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though.  I had no choice but to mount the fan on  the inner window frame for both windows. because the extensions do not reach far enough to mount on the outside of the window frame.  The windows cannot be shut with the fan mounted. because they have a 'lip' at the bottom. that overhangs a bit and runs the length of the window. to make opening and closing easier.  The lip interferes with the window closing while the fan is in place. so the fan must be removed from the mount if heavy rain is expected (Hurricane Irene. for instance!)  Even so. the fan is easily removed. once the screws are in place."
2,"Probably the best available today. but. certainly not like the old metal ones. It fits where and how I want it to go and will do the job.It's got some sharp plastic edges on the inside. Sliced a finger reaching in to slide the side panels to fit.Low and medium speeds don't move much air and the small motor whines a bit on high. Fortunately I don't have to be in the room with it when it's on high.It does a much better job than the Holmes dual window fan I was using but I do long for the old metal King Air 20' I had years ago. That was a window fan."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
2,"There are too many reviews already to fret over one detail or another. so here's my brief take: my fan is well balanced. no perceptible wobbling or shaking at any speed.  The blades spin freely suggesting little bearing drag to strain the motor.  I found that it easily fits several of my windows without actually mounting it (i.e.. installing the four screws that come with it).  That's a plus for me because I may want to use it in different rooms at different times - I can just set it in a window when needed. then remove it when I want it elsewhere or not at all.  My wattage meter says it uses about 63W on low and 78W on medium (very quiet at both low and medium speeds) and about 110W on high (noticeably louder than low/medium but not at all intrusive or annoying in my view).  If my house were bigger I'd buy another.  Good stuff."
2,"I'm so happy we have this fan!!!1. We turn it on &#34;reverse&#34; in the evening. drawing the cool air into our hot bedroom and it cools down the room a solid 10 degrees almost immediately.2. We leave it on all night in the reverse setting and it's completely changed our sleep pattern for the better. It keeps our room cool and drones out the loud road noise.3. I love having the option of having the window open still with the fan off and a soft breeze.4. The unit is not very attractive so we have a cafe curtain in front of it. When we turn it on. the curtain just blows upward and is not in the way.5. Install it on a window with a screen. We originally tried a different room. an old double hung window with no screen. and we woke up to a flying insect massacre on the floor. They were sucked in and didn't have a chance."
2,"Having a small kitchen and not a great exhaust. solutions like fan windows are great. but all too often they are small and have to sit below the window. That means that when it rains or cold out. you have to remove the fan to close the window. This fan stays in the window year round but allows you to open and close the window without having to remove the fan!  Not only that. it's very powerful and VERY quiet.  Cooking smells are eliminated very fast with the three speed reversible motor. I even let my smoking friends sit at the table when they light up because not a particle of smoke enters the house with this fan running.It's a great solution for us and I'm on my second year of using it."
2,"I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up."
2,"...for a fan that could pull air thru the whole house. but did not want to pay $200 for one.  This seems to have done the job.  I used it this past hot summer (2012) as an exhaust fan to move air in the house and to get it cooled off in the evening.  This machine seems to have done it. quietly...quieter that I thought it would be.  It is a two-directional fan. so you can bring air in or pull it out.  It also has 3 speeds. I used the medium speed all summer. 24/7.  No problems to report. would buy another.  I don't have AC here so this was it. and it stood the test. Recommended..."
2,"Really. this is close to an ideal fan if you want a window fan. The biggest issue is the way the fan mounts to the window frame. When you do it correctly it is secure. but not tight. There is just enough play in the way it mounts (drops down on screws) that there is a rattle when the fan is on. This was dealt with easily enough with some foam tape. but the tape needs occasional fixes.The ability to close the window while the fan is on. and reverse the airflow is great. For our apartment (1200sf) this fan can make a noticeable difference in temperature and air quality in about 5-10 minutes depending on the fanspeed. This is way more effective than sitting a box fan at the window because the airflow HAS to go through the window instead of cycling back into the fan."
2,"I needed a good window fan to keep the air moving in my country cottage. I am able to limit the use of A/C if I have a means for proper ventilation. This fan satisfies that need.It was fairly easy to install but still required a bit of ingenuity as the side panels were a bit of a challenge. They will slide but be patient because they will also break if forced.  The fan is very quiet. emitting a hum rather than a roar when running at full speed.I will leave the fan in the window for the entire season so I will not have to struggle with the side panels again until it is time to remove it."
2,"I installed this on a horizantaly sliding window.  It probably took about 10 to 20 minutes to install.  Its just 4 screws. It comes with a guide for the position of the screws which helped. It works awesome. You even have to put a door stop infront of a door in a beadroom if you have the fan in the room blowing the air in. otherwise its strong enough to slam your door shut. We liked it so much so that we bought a second one and installed it in the kitchen to clear the air when we are cooking.  we will usually put the fans on exaust and open up the living room window and it pulls in a strong breese with them both sucking the air thru the house.I can't recommend them enough. we wish we got them years ago!!!  Just make sure you open another window in the house so the air has somewhere to go."
2,"I bought an Air King 20' (same manufacturer of the Lasko) whole house fan a couple of years ago and it proved to be too much fan for my &lt; 2000 sq. ft. condo. I went for this 16' and it does the job just as quietly as the 20'. Very easy to install within the window frame and no vibration. I only wish that the side extenders were metal like they are on the Air King. The grill on the front of the fan is metal. I am very happy with this purchase and that's why it gets FIVE STARS. These are both excellent. high quality fans and I would not hesitate to purchase again."
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
2,"I bought my windmachine after my smaller honeywell fan finally died after a number of years.  In truth. I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night.  To that end. it's been perfect.  It's a powerful fan. so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise.  Note that this is not a small fan.  It's just shy of 2' tall. so while the handle on top makes it portable. and it's built to stand on the floor. it's not made for a tiny bedroom.  The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room. I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool.  I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I'm still very happy with it a year later!  Included 2 images for a visual."
2,"Before I finally installed air conditioning. I used this fan. In fact. I had two of them and used them for several years.This is the most powerful fan I've ever had. It doesn't rattle or clang like metal window fans. It really stirs up the air and cools the room.The three settings - low. medium and high - are achieved by turning a huge and easy to turn knob. You can tilt the fan up or down and than lock it into position using the knobs on the side. By placing one fan upward and another downward you'll get a wonderful and refreshing cross breeze.If you can't afford air conditioning or you live in an area that only needs a fan. you will love the WindMachine. I still use mine to dry clothes that I don't want to place in the drier. I hang them over the shower rod and turn the fans setting to high. The clothes are dry within a couple of hours."
2,"This is the second Wind Machine that I've owned. our first one just stopped working after almost 10 years.  We use ours almost exclusively in our very large master bedroom on the high setting (we like the sound and the breeze).  Others mentioned that it's not all that powerful. but we find it plenty strong for indoor/casual use.  It's not an industrial shop fan by any means. but it's great for cooling a large room. painted walls. even outside on a deck.  It's very light for it's size and the tilting feature is nice."
2,"I don't often rave about a product. but this one deserves it.  This is what I so love about it: 1. Works like a dream. No rattles. shakes. quivers. Just a steady strong stream of wonderful air.  2.Well built.  It arrived in the military pouch system with the box a bit smashed. but not a single dent on the item.  3. It's light.  I can cart it room to room very easily.  Even though it's so light. it sits on the floor very stably.  4. The only sound it makes is the sound of air moving. no whine. no rattles. no vibrations.  5. No assembly required. None! 6. The design is compact. extreme care given to maximizing output for the footprint.  I'm impressed."
2,"This fan really moves the air. To give you an idea how good this fan works. do you know those 20' box fans they sell for 15 or 20 bucks. well this Lasko 3300 fan on low blows as hard as the 20' box fan on high. No kidding. I think this is by far the best fan I've ever owned.Will post a couple pictures for you to get a better look at it. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan. Don't hesitate. buy it."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
2,"This fan will blow you down. Works just as good as the heavy duty silver fans. I sit my fan on top of my radiator or a stand right by the window at night and my room goes from hot to cold in a split second. It brings all that cool night air right into my house. All fans don't do this. Burrrrr I'm getting goose bumps now because I'm freezing. Let me get up and turn it to low now since its extremely cool in here. I have 2 of these. I used to have 3 but the third one disappeared. Maybe someone stole it.  Oh Well . anyway fan is definitely worth the price."
2,"Even on the lowest setting. this thing is definitely a wind machine. While my apartment is central air conditioned. I like to keep the thermostat on 78 to save energy. Having this fan definitely helps things feel cooler and results in less trips to the thermostat to turn down the temperature.When you crank this thing up to high. it's really a force to be reckoned with. My cat is slightly scared of it on higher settings as it does get a little loud and moves quite a bit of air.Added benefit is that if you use this in a bedroom at night. it serves as a pretty decent white noise source as well.Great fan all around. especially for those hot summer days."
2,"I received this cooker for Christmas 2008 ( a Wal Mart purchase).It was my first pressure cooker. and it cooked wonderfully (though it was a bit tight for two chickens); until it failed.After about 6 uses. it would no longer establish pressure.  The red pop up on the handle (indication that pressure was up and handle locked) started popping up to about twice the height it normally emerged from the handle (when the cooker worked) and steam vented from all around the handle junction with the lid.I tried everything the book said to do.  The handle was tight.  I inspected. streched and oiled the gasket. No luck.  I called Mirro (Wearever) and they told me to boil the gasket for 15 min. and then oil it.  I did all these things. to no avail.So I returned it.  Now I'm going to try Presto."
2,"Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run.  A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it.  Never thought I'd own one (grew up with one -- home cooking). so thought I'd try it myself.So you know. bought one at Walmart (has the Wearever brand)-- $40.00. and it comes with a real return policy vs. Amazon's 30 day return policy (make sure you read that before buying anything here...surprising how inflexible they are if you miss it by only a few days. even for long standing customers who have never asked for any special preferences.)"
2,"I bought this only to make apple sauce. Growing up. my mother had one (for 25+ years) that all of us kids would use and this is nothing like the one we used to use. I have used it 6-8 times and have found the following:- I can only fit a very small bowl underneath it.- The legs slide all over the place easily. I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine. but the craftsmanship is very low. VERY thin metal. and I don't expect this to last more than 2 seasons of making apple sauce. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this item."
2,"My 'ricer' - collander - food press arrived just an hour ago. I have fond memories of this 'ricer'. a favorite kitchen implement of my Dad's. I still have an old pestle from the old days.  The design is a little different from the ones of my childhood. but I think this design appeals to me more.  I love 'riced' potatoes and anticipate using this 'food press' to make tomato purees and finish other fruit. I'm just excited to have it."
2,"Back in the day. moms all had pressure cookers and made beef stews and pot roasts in them. These cookers are being rediscovered and are making a big comeback as they're not just for stew any more. Hundreds of new recipes are appearing and Amazon has some really good pressure cooker cookbooks available. We recently bought this Presto 4 qt. size (just for 2 of us) but larger sizes are available. Mom was right. they are FAST. make delicious food and will impress guests. They're not expensive - give this a try. you won't be disappointed."
2,"Other reviewers see the same problem as mine.The lower handle has little to hold it on. The single bolt that came with the pot is too small and won't hold on. We were forced into using a 32 thread 1/4' hex bolt. It held for a year. Now the handle has fallen off. again. Is the bolt the problem? No. it's the threaded receptacle! MAYBE. if I drill out the receiving threaded shank and try to force a 32 thread #10 bolt in.If This doesn't work. I'm avoiding buying another Presto from China.When the pot worked. it did well. A little hard to get the aluminium grooves to hit the slots without a fight.Nope. this cooker is useless. Presto you stink."
2,"There is little good about this Presto 4qt Aluminum pressure cooker.  It...Cannot keep the handle tight. I have to tighten it down about every other use.Cannot form a steam tight seal. steam leaks out around the handles. making them hot to touch. and through the pressure stem indicator that is supposed to seal off...it doesn't.Cannot keep the broth (fluid) inside from spewing out the weighted rocker pressure regulator even though the fluid level is well below the 4 guart level.Has no opposing handle; so picking it up while hot and full is problematic when trying to move the cooker to a faucet to cool it down.In a word. we got what we paid for...the cheapest and worst made pressure cooker on the market."
2,"Our 20+ year old 4 quart Presto pressure cooker has had at least half a dozen gasket replacements. We're pretty old. so I thought it was time to get my 79 year old cook. and lovely wife of 55 years a bright new pot instead of just another gasket.The old one worked well for all these years. and the new one already has a dozen or more cooking cycles on it - and appears to do as well as the one it replaced.BTW: we replaced a 6 quart Presto at the same time and the comment is the same on it."
2,"I was finally convinced that I need a pressure cooker for meat due to my work hours. I looked everywhere for the smallest size. they were either unavailable or too expensive. Reviews here showed great product so I bought it. I used it the very first day and I couldn't be more satisfied. Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes. I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that doesn't affect the cooking. It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook."
2,"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker. purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap. it not only does not do the job. the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker. that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk."
2,"I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault. I didn't realize that this model did not have a quick release. I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault. I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves. I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it. That is why I stuck with the same brand. I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also didn't like how I had to screw the handles into place. I want something that has permanently attached handles. I'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto. I can't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option. If anyone does. please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me."
2,"I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker. hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use. just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean. as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!"
2,"I live at 9500 ft altitude where it can take many hours to tenderize anything. I cook stew meat in 25 to 30 mins. pot roast in 50 mins. veggies in 5 mins after it gets up to temp. Trick is to have only the small recommended amount of water.I've had the 6 qt stainless for 18 years and need to replace the rubber seal and plug every 7 years or so. I use mine a lot. 3 times a week ($7 for both at AMZ) which is why I am here commenting. Don't get the aluminum ones. not good for you.Very safe and fool proof. You can't open it until it stops steaming.Tales about dangerous come from Grandmas who were cooking in the 1930's. 40 and early 50's before safety features.Buy into their recipes not their tales."
2,"This is my second presto pressure cooker in a year. I loved my first one and used it several times a week. but I didn't add enough water once. scorched the heck out of it. and it was never the same. I tried all the thrifty tricks to get out scorched ick but it didn't work. However. I liked and used this one so much I bought another one exactly like my first.I have a Russel Hobbes electric pressure cooker that is larger and really nice for food that cooks longer because I can set it and walk away. However. it's big and bulky. My Presto is my go too pressure cooker for potatoes. makes great cheesecake. I love pressure cooking squash. carrots etc. The construction is heavy and seems well made."
2,"Just received this unit. and I'm very happy with it so far. It is easy to assemble. sturdy. and most importantly has a very simple design which I anticipate will be durable into the future. My previous pressure cooker was a complex affair with springs and components tucked away in plastic housing so that they could not be accessed. This design. on the other hand. is much more simplistic. which is a very good thing. It cost about 1/4 the price of the cheapest PC that I could get in local stores (including postage). and is a preferable design."
2,"Strong words for a pressure cooker. I know. but this thing has been such a disappointment.  I bought it to replace my old 6-Quart Presto pressure cooker that worked well and faithfully for many years.  I'm not sure if they have started making these things in China after I purchased my last pressure cooker or what.  This new one is much lighter weight and the metal feels thin and cheap.  The handle screw continually comes loose which makes the handle itself loose and wobbly.  The pressure hole doesn't seem to line up properly so that I have to use a knife to wiggle the pressure button free to pop up so it can start to cook after the pressure builds.  If you are looking for a solid. reliable pressure cooker - - keep looking!  This is not the one!"
2,"I had never used a pressure cooker before but have been planning to buy one for a while. and decided to buy this one because it looks well made and has good reviews.I tried cooking several vegetables and some Sirloin tips (separately) and found the Sirloin surprisingly tender. the vegetables retained a lot more flavor.I did carefully read the instructions and after one or two uses found it easy to use. I bought a timer to use with it because cooking times seem to be important as does making sure it does not boil dry.This is a great time and energy saver. resulting in great tasting food!"
2,"I have been using Presto Pressure Cookers for the past 35+ years. they are simply the best on the market. and I have had other brands. those other brands ended up at my yard sale. the Presto Pressure Cooker is the best! always reliable. and I have never had to replace the gasket. that is saying something to the quality of the product. which by the was has been on the market for longer than I have been alive. and thats a long long time. so why bother with the rest when you can have the best. and at a great price. give it a try. you will be delighted with all you can make and the time saved cooking this way. especially cheaper cuts of meat.I can't say enough good things about this pressure cooker!"
2,"I had one of these great cookers long ago.  My old one was very heavy.  This one is made of stainless steel and seems to be lighter.  I had to attach the handles. so some assembly on this one is required.  My first recipe was. 'Ham Hocks & Navy Beans'. and I cooked the pre-soaked beans and ham hocks in about 25 or 30 minutes.  They turned out great. but had to guess at the cooking time. as the recipe was not in the enclosed instruction/recipe booklet. but in my head!  Since then. I have purchased two great pressure cooker cookbooks.  I plan to cook many more dishes in this quick-cooking appliance.  Be sure to read THOROUGHLY. the instruction booklet. to safely use this(& all) pressure cookers."
2,"I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130."
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
2,"I have an electric pressure cooker that has a hard anodized interior that is sometimes impossible to clean.  This stainless steel pressure cooker is a breeze to clean.  As soon as it arrived I went to my local hardware store and replaced all of the screws with stainless steel because that seem to be a problem with other users.  I soaked some black beans and after only 4 minutes cooking under pressure. I had a pot of beans.  The 6 quart size is perfect for me since you can't fill it too much.  I just love my new pressure cooker.  Looking forward to many great meals."
2,"We have had a pressure cook for many years.  It was great for camping. for we could make New England Boil Dinner.  My wife has our old one at the shore. and we use it a lot.  However. many of the family are not there but in our villa 100 miles away. and we like many meals that we us the Presto pressure cooker.  Now. I can make the dinners here. and we thing they are the best pressure cookers around.  It is great time saver."
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
2,"This is a really excellent item....but the little rubber safety button (to release pressure if something gets clogged) isn't as good as it could be.  Every now and then. it releases the steam so no pressure can build up.  If I jiggle it. to get it to set. it generally falls down into the kettle.  At that point. I have to remove the lid. and fish the button out of whatever is in there -- easy if it's broccoli. but more of a problem if it's bean soup.  I realize that this is my fault for not checking it each time. but with my old one (not nearly as good. overall) I never had to think about it.  Remember. this is a GREAT pressure cooker -- I'm just kvetching."
2,"I always avoided pressure cookers until a little over a year ago. I purchased the Presto 6-quart electric version. I love it. but it is annoying to have to drag it out when I wanted to use it. I saw this smaller size stove-top variety and hoped it would be as good as the electric. It's better!  I never put it away because it has become my go-to pan whether or not I'm using the pressure cooking feature. It's a good weight. great heat distribution. NOT aluminium. and sturdy. As a pressure cooker. I find that I can turn the heat on my stove to between 2 and 3 and it works beautifully. From using the other pressure cooker once or twice a month. I find I use this one three-four times a week. Minor issue - yes - the screws do rust. One of these days. I'll take one to Home Depot so I can get a non-rusting version."
2,"my mother used her pressure cooker to feed 5 kids on a regular basis. and the stories of her mother's old ring-style pressure cooker. well... just hilarious.  I have no such entertaining stories. just dozens of great meals cooked quickly and well in a cooker that goes directly into the dishwasher. no fuss. no muss.  Learn how to use one and you will never live without one.  This one is quite good because if the cooker isn't stainless steel. putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white.  And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood."
2,"I've used a Premium grade. Innova 8 Qt. for years. It is way too big for every day. single person use. The Presto works decently. but not well built. The handles are fastened by only one screw. The lid closing stop. catches past the point it should be. The lid pressure open-lock safety takes effort to seat when heating up.The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in. Dia. Without the lid. the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in. height. the 6 Qt is only 2 in. taller making it the better option. A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.Induction compatible??? A magnet sticks to the bottom and top. but not the sides."
2,"I replaced my old Aluminium Pressure cooker (4 Litre) from India with this wonderful stainless steel pressure cooker. The quality is great and the price is fantastic. The pressure cooker from India blew a whistle by itself to let out the pressure and 4-5 whistles were enough to cook lentils. rice. potatoes etc.. This cooker does not blow the whistle by itself (starts rocking) but instead I manually let out the steam 4-5 times. Saves a lot of energy and cooks quickly. I have 2 dabbas ( containers ) from the previous cooker that fit inside this cooker. That way I can cook Dal and rice at once. Definitely recommend this cooker. I ordered an extra gasket just in case :) Always better to keep extra gaskets"
2,"My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.  Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.  What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating. & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.  I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.  This one is so much quieter. too.  Tonight. I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.  You can't beat that.  The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.  I should have bought this years ago."
2,"Been using pressure cookers for years - grew up on a farm - pressure cookers abundant.Needed to replace the 30+ year old Mirro aluminum one.Still have my aluminum 2 1/2 qt Mirro but wanted a bigger one.So I bought this one to try. Cookers are all basically the same.HOWEVER -----I wish SOMEone would have posted SOMEwhere that this product is- wait for it - - -MADE IN CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA!Oh I get it - if we are told it is not USA made. we will look elsewhere.What a rip! I am so very disappointed that we cannot purchase something made in the USA anymore.Thanks to all our government officials by helping every one on this planet but our own people.We cannot even buy a cooking pot for cripes sake!Let's see if in another 30 years I still have this CHINESE pot.For cryin' out loud.......................  :o("
2,"I prefer meat browned. and veggies either raw. stirfried. fermented or roasted. so I got this primarily for making bone broths. cooking legumes and cooking whole grains.I got the 4-quart as it's just me and hubby here. but I did not realize you can't fill this more than 2/3rd full.  Now I wish I'd have ordered the 6-quart.Even though it's stainless. it's very lightweight.  This is handy as I have permanent chest pain after surgery. so lifting can be difficult.It works fine.  It makes very concentrated fast broths in the summer when I don't want things simmering on the stove for hours.  Similarly. I can cook big batches of legumes and freeze in meal-sized portions fast.  I haven't tried grains yet as I was on a risotto kick when this arrived. and then went on a temporary grain-free diet.I am quite satisfied. except I wish I'd gotten the larger one."
2,"Amazing quality ... made a whole chicken in less than 30min... juicy and perfect.. moist... cleans up beautifully... Very pleased with this product!...Just wanted to add a note.. I never run water over the pan to cool it down...as it is still cooking.. I know how long meat and veggies take when cooking traditionally. so I time it based on experience. When you let it cool on it's own. that is part of the actual cooking time with the pressurization. Follow the instructions and you can't go wrong.  I just shut the fire down about 10min less to incorporate cool down... Any longer would be overdone..."
2,"I've used pressure cookers for many years including some of those very expensive models.  This is one of the best cookers I've ever owed.  This cooker is constructed of high quality stainless steel and is very easy to use.  Pressure cookers are very safe. If you follow a few simple rules. you'll never have a problem.  I use my cooker weekly for everything from cream of potato soup to braised lamb shanks with wine sauce.  Additionally. it is amazingly cheap to own. My only con: wish it was made in the USA. otherwise. highly recommend."
2,"They are so quick and efficient.  When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep. that's how much I love them.  My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.  However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.  So he bought me this smaller version.  Obviously it weighs less. takes up less room in my cupboard. and comes to heat much quicker.  What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!"
2,"If the handles fit tighter without wobbling I'd love it but you cant complain too much for the $25 or so I paid. Good things are its not too big. the lid goes on real smooth. the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go. when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move. lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of."
2,"I've looked and checked out many other pressure cookers before buying this one. From the costly ones in department stores to others online. Department stores prices were to high and I couldn't get any product information from the sales people I would talk with. After reading the reviews here I decided to purchase the Presto. Best choice I've made. The arrival was within a few days. The Cooker is great looking after using it for four different meals. We have enjoyed a delicious pot roast. chicken with veggies. and a hard to cook oxtail stew. There was no problem with reading the directions on how to use. I did it without my husband my assistance. (he's better with gagets). I am planning on using it at least once a week for hardy winter meals."
2,"This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.  I am happy about 'stainless steel' because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made. top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that. I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."
2,"It's been several months since I've purchased the Presto 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker. and I have to admit that this cooker packs some seriously power!  Having a pressure cooker speeds up cooking so much - I've been able to make a lot of Chinese Soups in a fraction of the time it takes to make normally!  This pot is especially good when cooking soups with proteins. particularly beans and meat.  Because it cooks so quickly. we're not only enjoying dinner faster. but saving a lot of energy to boot!  Highly recommended!"
2,"As a child I was scared to death of my mom's pressure cooker and swore I'd never have one.  But this one is very  nice.  There are two ways to cook with it after the little toggle starts rocking you are instructed to (1) put the pot under water and it cools down all at once. or (2) let it cool down on its own.  If you are instructed to let it cool down on its own. it can take up to 30 minutes to cool down. I thought cooking with this would be a lot quicker; but that aside. it is a great way to have something that really does cook in a fraction of the time it normally takes to cook something; but it is not a &#34;microwave&#34; quick type of instrument."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
2,"My mom brought a pressure cooker from Brasil 15 years ago. and on our last trip she was not able to find replacement rubber gaskets for it. I talked her into replacing it for something new. shiny and fancy. The quality is there. and the locking mechanism is STRONG. It's not a latch on the handle like a traditional pressure cooker. This unit has slots all around the pan that link up to the lid. and you rotate the lid to seal the unit. That means there's more than 8 latches on the pan. Those beans aren't getting out any time soon."
2,"I had this in my wishlist & received it for Christmas.  I've used it several times & I love it.  Its smaller than the one I had previously but that is perfect for us.  Only 3 at home anymore.I love that this is made of stainless steel.  The insert is still made of aluminum which Im not thrilled about but I dont have to use it if I dont want to.This pressure cooker is also a lot quieter than my old one is.  I appreciate that a LOT!Its a great product and Im so happy to have it."
2,"The handle for the pot is secured with only one screw. The handle itself is curved to fit against the pot. but the directions emphasize multiple times that you shouldn't overtighten to avoid cracking the plastic.  I tightened it reasonably and when the pot is full and it's tilted to pour out the contents (boiling water for example). the handle wobbles/turns slightly.  I can easily see this becoming a hazard with continued use/failure to retighten regularly.  Fortunately. Amazon was willing to accept the return.  The company could resolve this problem by using metal on the edge of the handle piece. selling their pots pre-assembled in a more sturdy manner. or hey- bright idea- USING TWO FASTENERS LIKE EVERY OTHER POT MANUFACTURER.  Hmm."
2,"Before purchasing this pressure cooker. I went to Macy's and bought an aluminum pressure cooker because it was on sale.  Got it home and tried it out.  After cooking my meal. I noticed the inside of the pressure cooker had become terribly discolored. I did not want my family eating out of that pressure cooker.  So I immediately took it back.  I purchased the Presto 6-qt. pressure cooker and I do love it.  It is stainless steel. easy clean-up and no discoloration.  I should have known better because I had a Presto for over 25 years.  The rocker on my old one wore out and I knew it was time to get another.  If you're looking to replace an older model or just plain looking for a new pressure cooker. you won't be disappointed with this one."
2,"This purchase was one of the first times that Amazon reviews let me down. As others have recently stated. it seems Presto has changed manufacturing of the screws. making the handles of this pressure cooker unsteady...no matter how many times I tighten the screws. and how tight I. or my husband. try to get them. they loosen and the handles become very wobbly. This is not just a problem with one handle. but both handles! I tried this item for a week. which required retightening the handles about a dozen times. and I have given up.Additionally. after only two washes. the screws are already starting to rust! I didn't wash it in the dishwasher. it was by hand.I can understand why this is an inexpensive product...it is cheaply made! However. I am baffled at why it gets such good reviews."
2,"One upon a time. many years ago.. I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well. time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work. I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home. I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!"
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
2,"I've owned several pressure cookers over the years.  This one is my current favorite for several reasons.  First. I like the 4-qt. size.  It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.  Next. I'm happy with the  quality of the product.  It's hefty enough to feel substantial. yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.  The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.  Last. this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt. model.  I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one. but I like the speed.  I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.  I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again."
2,"This seems to be a high quality product at a very reasonable price.  It cooks less expensive cuts of beef (stew meat. chuck roast. corned beef) to mouth watering tenderness in a fraction of the time required in either an oven or slow cooker.  It quickly cooks two or three pounds of chicken for salads. sandwiches. or freezing.  Cook a pork roast with your favorite barbeque sauce in 30-45 minutes and enjoy pulled pork sandwiches infused with the flavor of the sauce.  This would be a great tool for the cook who likes make- ahead meals and stocking the freezer for quick-reheating weekday dinners.  Get the stainless steel model to avoid the reaction of aluminum to acidic foods.  Eventually you will be glad you did.The clad base is very heavy so I wouldn't recommend using the pan for pasta or vegetables but if you have strong wrists and arms you could do this.  Other lids are available from Presto."
2,"My wife is from Brazil. so she is a foremost authority on pressure cookers as they use them there for almost every meal daily.Originally I tried the very cheap aluminum alternative for $15 on sale at Sears. and it failed after one use.This is better than the ones that last 20 years in Brazil. It's efficient. it's durable. it's just plain a good product. and you really shouldn't pay more for a pressure cooker than $40-$50 as it's a very simple item."
2,"I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.  I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto. missed it and decided to get another one.  The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.  This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.  The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.  It seems to be pretty stout overall.  I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks."
2,"This is an investment every house cook should make. The meats come out super duper tender and it takes no time at all. 10 min and your chicken for soup or any dish is ready! The top is very very sturdy so do not worry about it coming off or exploding while under pressure. I love my pressure cooker and this smaller size is perfect for my husband and I since it's just the two of us. And remember to always get STAINLESS STEEL. Aluminium eventually peels off and isn't as durable. plus it's toxic for you. Oh. and cleaning is a snap!!! Dishwasher safe and even is  you do it by hand. nothing sticks :) good purchase"
2,"Gas and electricity has gone up so much lately. Pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster.  It comes with a compact user guide and a small cookbook.Pressure cookers can be dangerous. so make sure to read the safety precautions. Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity. You cannot open the lid while it is still pressurized with the built-in precautionary lock. but the rocker valve can easily get toppled and extremely hot steam can escape through it.Pros:- Stainless steel. You do not want aluminum for health reasons.- We have been using this for more than 5 years.  We just have to replace the rubber gasket around the lid.- Although not as cheap as we like it to be. if you compare it to other manufacturers. you still save some money.Cons:- The pressure valve rocker. Other pressure cookers (but more expensive) has a  non-removable pressure valve.  It is often get misplaced.- The rocker makes quite a bit noise."
2,"Get the Presto. They're all the same. It's a simple design. a pot and lid. I've been using them for 20 years and the expensive ones are no better than the Presto- Only an amateur cook would believe different. The Prestos cook just as good and just as fast as the Rikons. My kitchen is filled with the best and most expensive equipment money can buy. but when it comes to pressure cookers. it's not like other cookware where you 'get what you pay for.'  They're all the same (although I don't recommend the electric ones as they have a tendency to break down). Save your money for the good espresso maker... don't waste it on expensive pressure cookers. Get the Presto."
2,"As many folks out there. including Anthony Bourdain I too was scared of pressure cookers. After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual. as if for a school test. The rocker type is really totally harmless! Cooking times are slashed by at least two thirds. less gas and therefor less escaped heat and better inefficiency make this cooking method a winner. Cleanup is also very quick. The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat. which is essential for good flavor. Anne Burrell always says:&#34;Brown Food tastes Good&#34;."
2,"I have always been afraid of pressure cookers because as a child my mother always banned me from the kitchen when she was using one. Well. twenty some odd years later I finally purchased this one.  I read the instruction booklet and the first night made mashed potatoes and a pot roast.  Wow!  My 12 year old son loved the meal and said these mashed potatoes were the best he ever ate and the meat was so tender.  It was so easy to use and easy to clean.  I am already planning on making BBQ pork ribs next!  Whoo-Hoo! Buy it! Use it!....but read the instructions first! Enjoy:-)"
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
2,"I bought this pressure cooker to make chili. I've never owned or used a pressure cooker and was a bit nervous when I fired it up for the 1st time. It heat up real quick using a ceramic glass cook top. and I was to able to brown the meat realitively quick. The contruction of this pressure cooker looks very high quality and well made. The only thing I wanna add is be very careful with when to lower the heat and when to move the steam controlling top on the top. You can lower the heat as soon as you see steam coming out of the bottom of steam controlling top. and be very careful not to touch the top until the nipple on the handle drops down. indicating that there's no pressure in the cooker. Good investment!"
2,"Sadly returning this.  The handles won't stay tight and the screws that hold them are already rusting. Plus hard to get it up to pressure - too much sputtering around the handle for a long time!  I remember my Mother cooking delicious tender meats in her pressure cooker years ago.  But I did not have good results with this one. Followed directions and chicken came out tough.  And - a magnet won't stick to the interior (only the exterior)...so maybe the interior is not stainless steel. but aluminum..which is not what I want to cook my food in. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy."
2,"My Mom always told me horror stories about pressure cooker. but I really wanted one after listening to my friend's successful experience with it. I got this 4-quart one several weeks ago. and I am super happy with it!!  I have been pulling an entire beef top round and pork shoulder straight out of FREEZER to cook in pressure cooker. and I was able to serve dinner in an hour.  It's perfect for a poor planner like me.I did read the manual over and over to make sure it is safe. and yes. it is safe!"
2,"I have had the 4 quart pressure cooker for quite some time.  and based on its performance.  I purchased the 6 quart for myself and one for my daughter as well.  We are very pleased.  This is a good product.  but it is important to read and follow the instructions for use and care in order to get the most satisfactory results. I was raised with Presto pressure cookers. and have used others.  None have performed better. in my opinion.  The reasonable price is an added bonus.5/10/08: Presto offers a stainless steel steamer basket and a glass lid as optional accessories that fit both their 4 qt. and 6 qt. pressure cookers.  I purchased the steamer for my daughter and myself.  and the lid for myself.  These products have been welcome additions to our cooking tools.  Do not be afraid to spend the extra money for them...they are well worth it!"
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
2,"I've used a 6-qt. aluminum pressure cooker for years.  It finally bit the dust so I decided to try a stainless steel cooker.  This one is taller. but not as wide. as my previous cooker.  However. it is plenty big to hold a 3-4 pound chicken or roast. which is what I usually cook in it.  So far I really like it - and no problems yet with hardware rusting like I've read in a few reviews.  I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a not-too-big pressure cooker!"
2,"This is my first pressure cooker and I really like it.  For this price. it is a good choice for those who aren't sure if they will use it much.  It is especially useful for vegetarians.  Beans that normally take 2 hours to simmer in a sauce pan are done in 20 minutes in the pressure cooker.  I was afraid to use it at first but there are safety features which should make you comfortable using it.  As long as it is under pressure. you cannot open the top.Although I do like this product. it is overly large for my needs.  If you just plan on cooking a cup or two of beans at a time. I would recommend getting the 4 qt version of this product.  Because the pressure cooker is so fast. there's really no need to make large batches of things."
2,"I love my pressure cooker. Super reliable and if you follow the directions. it always cooks perfectlly Brown rice is cooked in 12 minutes! My first lesson was to factor in the amount of time it takes for the pressure cooker to cool down enough to open the lid. That usually takes another 10 minutes - if you are trying to orchestrate all your food being ready at the same time for a hot meal. I am guessing the cool down time is also part of the cooking process. The instruction/cook book that comes with it is very right on and helpful. Very east to clean. make sure you take out the rubber gasket from the lid and clean it well after each use. I have read that pressure cooking retains more nutrients in the food than any other type of cooking. Makes sense because so little steam or anything escapes."
2,"So we've had this vacuum cleaner for a bit over a  year now. It was purchased September 8. 2009.Currently. my wife is complaining that the vacuum is not providing enough suction to pick up the dirt. The bag in the back was emptied so we know that's not the problem. Time is going to be spent trying to figure out what's wrong with it. and it may be finished das far as I know.My impression of the vacuum over time hasn't been that great. It performed rather poorly on hardwood flooring from the start. and I can't say I was overly impressed on carpet. It's clunky to move around. and when the bag approaches full it tends to tip over."
2,"I've been vacuuming for over 40 years and I enjoy trying new products.I have a myriad of machines. from $100.00 to $1400.00.  No matter what I try. Eureka makes the best vacuuming products and this particular model is best for carpets.  The ergonomics are perfect. but the singularly winning aspect of this machine is it's strong suction and firm grabbing power as you pull it back toward yourself. It's easy use is a huge plus for me - no need to disassemble. re-arrange. clean or empty trays. reassemble. etc.  I just tap the 'On' button. release the handle and go.  I'll buy one of these for every floor in the house and keep each plugged in and ready to go."
2,"I've only had this vacuum for 2 months but it's everything the other reviews said it was.  It's light and easy to maneuver.  I have two long hair cats and it has no problem with all of the shedding.  I like the carpet level adjustment so I can do the bare floor as well as the carpet (for thorough cleaning I use a small wand vacuum for the bare floors).  Assembly is a cinch. took me under 1/2 hour.  Returned my Oreck in favor of this one."
2,"My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them.  I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag.  I am very pleased with it.  It is fairly quiet for a vacuum cleaner. my old model used to scream like a banshee.  and it doesn't have a bunch of hoses wrapped around it constantly coming loose like my old model.  It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model.If you just need to vacuum the floor. this model is great."
2,"We purchased this unit originally for our own use. because our relatives had one of these always available happily for decades. but later. we shared this unit with a close family who needed it to help them with maintenance of newly refurbished wood flooring. and now that WE are writing this review. WE are reminded that WE really need to purchase another of these units in the not too distant future. hopefully still available from Amazon. when it comes time for us to make another purchase of it. because WE feel after years of family use. that this type of unit really is the BEST to use to clean and polish floors and make the job at hand the easiest possible. and the family we shared our other unit with. also voiced this same response to us as well. Blessings to you in all your floor maintenance adventures."
2,"My Mom bought me one of these from Walmart when I was in middleschool. Ive kept it ever since... Its lasted through highschool. going to summer camp. it went to college with me (I used it as extra seating and as a bed a couple of times). It made it through moving 3 times after college and the only reason it didnt deploy with me (much better than Army Toughboxes) is that it didnt have wheels. its lasted half a lifetime and still doesnt even have a strach on it. I love this thing!"
2,"I got the 35-gallon size to store some items in the basement that I wanted to be able to get to conveniently but also be able to lock up and keep out of the kids' hands. This box is absolutely perfect for what I intended. Maybe even a bit of overkill on my part (this thing is super solid) but better safe than sorry. It is very well made. Of course. I'm not truly putting it through its paces by using it in a truck bed or travelling through air ports with it or anything like that. but after receiving it and having a chance to see how well made it is. I have little doubt it would excel for those uses as well.Note: If you are looking on putting a lock on it. I recommend you get the 'cable' style of Master combo lock that Amazon suggests. The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock. Not impossible. but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable."
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
2,"Excellent durability.  Good space inside and latches closed.  Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.  As built now. you will need two people to handle this huge bin.  Would also help if the handholds were deeper.  Overall. very good.Update 11/22/11:  Not as durable as I had originally thought.  Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split. so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid.  And yes. the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.  Still. it's a decent box that continues to function okay."
2,"I purchased 2 of the 24 Gallon size. one to use as an emergency medical supply container and one to utilize as a portable survival (bug out) box. I found that the 24 gallon size is plenty large enough for each of my intended uses. I kept my items limited to what was most basic and necessary and I still have room for some additional items.I am pleased that I got the 24 gallon size for my purposes because even when they are packed I can still lift them and they are easily transportable. I would think a larger size container that was packed may be too heavy to handle without help.I have posted some pictures. they have hard plastic handles that snap into position and they have a place for you to lock then. Sturdy enough construction and appear to be rugged and durable."
2,"I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many. many (20?) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps. It has sat out in broiling sun. freezing winter. pouring rain. and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy. I was delighted to see that these were still available. and the new one looks just like the old one. but with brighter colors (and less dirt!) It should be good for another 20 years!"
2,"Here's the question: does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry?  Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo?  If so. then this isn't for you if it's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier.  OTOH. if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate. then it'll do that OK.  I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.  It's *pretty* tight... but not totally so.  It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm."
2,"I installed two Lasko 3012 fans in my fitness room after some modifications to enable them to mount them directly over the power receptacles which are at 72 inches above the floor.I replaced the existing room duplex wall receptacles with the Leviton 688 recessed receptacle and modified the fan by removing all but about 20 inches of power cord and drilling a 1.75 inch hole in the back of the fan allowing the remainder of the cord and the rear of the plug to recess into the fan. The end result is that there is no power cord showing (just like in the picture (where the power cord must have been removed)). The Leviton 688 and fan mounting plate also had to be modified just slighting in order to accommodate each other. Naturally. I tested the fans before making the modifications which were not difficult at all.The fans aren't noisy and they move plenty of air on low speed."
2,"Fed-Ex just dropped it at my door a matter of minutes ago.  Thought I would give it quick test on the kitchen floor.  WOW!  Floor clean in seconds.  Before I realized it. the entire 2 bedroom apartment was clean in a couple of minutes.  It whizzed across the ceramic tile floors and short nap throw rugs.  Who knew this kind of power could be had for 65 dollars?  Excellent value.  How can such a light weight vacuum have so much power?  It took me longer to write this review then vacuum the entire apartment.  I love it."
2,"I used to own a Mighty Light. which is a very similar vacuum from Eureka.Used that one for about 5-6 years until it finally broke.This thing is slightly stronger and a little louder.This vacuum does a great job getting dust and Cat hair from just about anything(carpet. velvet drapes). Best part is you do not have to run the thing over every inch of the surface (unlike other small canisters). it's powerful enough to suck dust in even when it's in the close proximity."
2,"I like this vacuum and am glad I purchased it.  The price was good and for hard floors it it easy to use and is quite powerful.  One complaint that I do have is that because of the bend in the hose handle sometimes clogs occur if you accidentally vacuum up something like paper or large pieces of something.  It is hard to clear it but the suction hole in the handle helps enable you to 'fish out' whatever is in there.  I wish that the handle was not bent.  It may make it easy to hold but the tendency for clogging is greatly increased.  Other than that I have no complaints.  You cannot beat the price and for hard surfaces it works better than any upright I have owned.  For the carpet in my bedrooms I do use an upright for so I would not suggest using this for plush carpet. However it does work well on area rugs and low pile carpets."
2,"Let's be honest: this is an inexpensive vacuum and yet. it lives up to everything the manufacturer says it does.  I have a Dyson that is amazing on carpet -  but I recently moved to a condo that has all hardwood floors and it just wasn't doing the job. With the recent move. I didn't want to spend more than a $100 dollars but also didn't want to regret my purchase.  After carefully reading the reviews here - I decided on the Eureka.Here are some pros:1. Amazing suction power2. Super lightweight3. Very long extension - can reach high places easily4. The hose where it connects to the vacuum rotates. creating smooth movement5. Nice long cordHere are the cons:1. The extension tubes sometimes don't stay attached while vacuuming (can be annoying)2. The opening under the floor tool does not extend the width to the edges (but the suction power makes up for it)I hope this was helpful!"
2,"After our quite old Eureka canister vacuum had finally gone belly up. we were looking for an appropriate replacement.  Because this was needed primarily for cleaning hardwood floors. there were a few critical criteria.  It had to be strong. yet compact in size.  It should not be too loud. and the tool assortment should be appropriate for floors and vacuuming cat hair of various furniture items.  Finally. we did not want to have to mess around with cleaning out bagless vacuum containers.  The Eureka Mighty Mite 3670 came through with flying colors on all fronts.  It produces a powerful vacuum. easily maneuverable. convenient for storing. the noise is not too bad. and a good price.  This vacuum cleaner gives an excellent value. and. certainly. gets the job done that we bought it for."
2,"I can only give this a 3. Tools are to small-the motor has a w h i n e to it that drives me nuts! The motor also seems to get very hot--maybe I got a dud and just don't know it. The hoses are stiff-no flexibility at all. I do like a canister vacuum though as opposed to an upright-at least this one follows me around and doesn't knock me out when I pull it along. All in all it is an OK product but they could have done a much better job with the design--you must wrap the cord on the bottom for storage-not a useful feature at all--does it work ok? Sure it does. Should you buy it? Only if you don't mind all the above draw backs."
2,"I didn't expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum.  I was purchasing to vacuum cat and dog hair on my carpeted stairs and to vacuum my car.  This little 'mighty mite' packs a big punch.  Superb suction. compact and light weight. but does not feel flimsy.  When researching this purchase I found the other customer reviews helpful. and I also found other references to this model as being one of the better canister compacts.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum."
2,"I've had one of these for a couple of months and so far. so good.  It is loud but tolerable.  I think the bags are easy to change -- as with most vacuums. I recommend not waiting until a bag is overfull or things get messy. The long hose is good for reaching under things but makes it a bit of a pain to store.  I think the plastic it is made of is a bit cheap and I wonder if it will hold up over time.  I didn't want to spend a lot though and think it's a good product for the price."
2,"Probably best vaccuum I have ever owned. I only ever buy stand up vacuums but this one had great reviews and I thought. what the heck. It is really light. I hardly ever notice it trailing along behind me. and it has a really good suction! I love the long hose and different attachments. Whereas I used to just vacuum my rugs. now my cleaning routine consists of me vacuuming everything in my house. I mean everything. Lol. It goes from hardwood to carpet easily. the bags last a long time. There are 2 cons on this product in my opinion. 1) the cord does not retract. and 2) the hose is somewhat thin and occasionally kinks. It does seem the hose won't last long but I can't imagine it is much to replace."
2,"My law office is 2.000 square feet of carpeted and tiled floors. We have an upright and a steam vac for the carpets and they do fine. I bought this 3670G 12 amp Eureka mainly for the tiled floors. cleaning the drapes and (because of its long wands) hard to reach places behind desks and work tables. I am very pleased with it. It uses bags. but that is a good feature for us as we like bags when pulling up dust and dust mites (the bags are cheap as I just bought 24 for $12). I do not recommend this vacuum for carpets in general because the large attachment you see in the photo is not a brush attachment (it does come with a smaller brush attachment for drapes and hard to reach spots). But for sucking up loose junk on tile and in between tiles it is great. It is also great for cleaning drapes (floor to ceiling) and hard to reach spots because of the long wand extensions.  Would buy again if needed. 4 stars"
2,"This powerful little light-weight machine cleans my house in no time. When the bag gets full. pop out that one and replace it with a new one. My house is about 1500 square feet with only one small area rug. No. it's not great on the rug. But the floors with dog and cat hair. dust bunnies and garden bits tracked in are clean in no time. Then I vacuum the big velvet couch and other furniture. dog pillows. and even the cob webs that appear now and again. This was a marginally careful purchase. My last Mighty Mite lasted for twelve years. the previous one for eight. Hard to look at another brand for vacuuming for me."
2,"The Eureka vacuum itself is amazing.  It is very powerful in such a small unit. It is surprised me at the first time when I used it. There is a small vent hole in conjunction of the handler. I accedentally put my left hand over the hole (I should xeal the hole first). The vacuum suck force made a bruise on my hand.The unit is very convinient (portable). I used it for the hard wood floor and on my Mini-Van. I do not need to buy another one for my mini-van."
2,"I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum.  I hate this vacuum and here is why:  It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic. cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction.  The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air.  The body is cheap plastic.  The unit is difficult to manuever. the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog. 2 cats. a baby. hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it.  I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully.  I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap."
2,"I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS!  It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT!  The on/off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one.  Came here to Amazon. marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history (IN 24 HOURS!) BUT...even though the machine itself does a great job. the parts are CHEAP!  The hose is not flexible. twists all the time. I wish I had saved the hose from the old one; the electric cord is awful. very stiff. very hard to wrap around the handle. and gets easily tangled in itself.  I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just doesn't cut it; next time. I'll get another brand."
2,"I recently put in hardwood floors and was looking for a light vacuum to use that would be quick to get the job done.  This vacuum is amazing! Strong suction. light enough to carry around with one hand. and I vacuumed the main level of my house literally in 5 minutes!  My husband put a strap on it too so I can wear it on my shoulder.  It makes doing the stairs very easy. The cord doesn't retract. which is kind of annoying. but I'm willing to out up with that.  The hose pieces/extender just attach with pressure and a few times they have come apart. but they would likely be fine if I get my husband to push the pieces together.  Overall very happy with this purchase."
2,"I purchased this Mighty Mite to replace one I had over 15 years.  The only things on this new one that even comes close in comparrison are the power of the motor - which is good. and the extension wands.  The hose is so poor quality that it folded and cut off the air flow on my first use!! the housing feels like it will crack if you bump it into something. the wheels are not much better.  The motor makes for good suction. that is really the only positive I can give on this unit.  The old gray model I had since the late 80's was wonderful! I replaced that one with an Oreck. but wanted to go back to something with wheels on the floor for touch-ups. baseboards. overhead cleaning. etc."
2,"I bought this because I have bare floors with just a few scatter rugs.  It works great on the floors. and is easy to move around. with a very long cord.  I would only rate it as adequate on rugs - it works fairy well on low pile. but not well on high piles. and has a very hard time getting cat hair up.  The pieces of tube that make up the nozzle have a nasty tendency to separate. and so I have duct-taped them together.Pros:  long cord. great on bare floors. light and easy to manouverCons:  ability to handle cat hair. deep-piled carpets. tubes don't stay together"
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
2,"The Eureka Mighty Mite is made in China.I bought mine from Amazon in September 2011. so just over a year ago.  It has very good suction. and it is cheap.  The attachments aren't very effective. but overall. it is a pretty good vacuum.  I have a golden retriever. so the vacuum is a little overmatched. but considering it is about $60. I have no complaints whatsoever.I did just buy a more expensive vacuum. which is much better. Mighty Mite is now my teams backup QB. I hope I don't need to use him. but I am confident that if our number 1 goes down with an injury the Mighty Mite knows the playbook. and can perform capably under center.Go Bears!"
2,"My unit is an older model which is called &#34;The Boss&#34; but is the very same as this.  Mine has EXCELLENT suction and I don't mind that it is a little noisy.  Mine is used for cleaning up around the woodstove.  It does an excellent job of sucking up ash and wood particles of various sizes.  I don't understand the negative reviews. unless these people received &#34;lemons&#34;.  I would highly recommend this vac for small jobs. I don't think it was intended to be used for  whole house vacuuming."
2,"This is one of the best household products I ever bought.  This is a very powerful little unit and makes all those hard to clean areas a snap to clean.  I don't know what I did without this before.  From day one it was in use.  I now can get all the floor corners and ceiling corners that were so hard to get with a regular Vacuum and attachments.  And. you can vacuum your car with this too.  You can't go wrong with this canister vac."
2,"This is a great basic vacuum. It is great for my small apartment. I have a low pile IKEA rug and it works amazing on it as well as my hardwood. I like how simply each piece just fits into each other without any buttons to get broken off. My only complaint that it has a little sliding piece to remove big debris before it gets sucked into the accordian part of the hose. That sliding mechanism is great. but it's exactly where you put your hands when you vacuum. So. from time to time it opens and you lose a little suction and it has pinched my hand. That said. i can always slap a piece of tape on that part. because otherwise this vac is so good. Suction is really great. Cant beat it for the price."
2,"We needed a new vacuum and I could not decide on what i really wanted. So far this thing has been pretty sweet for the price. Your are obviously not going to get quiet. super cyclone. bagless. blah blah blah and I was not expecting that. This thing is loud. takes bags and has is not easy to store. But it does the job we needed and that is what counts.I am taking one star off because I really wish there was a place to clip the hose and attachment tubes to the housing for better storage. Other than that. color me impressed."
2,"I bought the Mighty Mite about a year ago and have been very pleased.  On the plus side. it has very strong suction and enough nozzle variety to get the job done. It is light weight and easy to store.  It is perfect for small apartment living. Minor negatives is that the light weight accordion hose sometimes kinks and because the vac is light weight. it will may tip about when you are moving around with it.  There is no beater brush. but the brush on the nozzle and the great suction make up for it.  For what you pay. it is a very good purchase."
2,"I hate. absolutely HATE. having debris on our hardwood floors. So I did a lot of research and found this vacuum. It has a very powerful suction AND it doesn't scratch our floors. It is also lightweight and has a very long cord. So when I vacuum. I usually gently tug the vacuum while holding the hose and the little guy follows me around like a loyal companion. It is very versatile and includes different attachments to suit your vacuuming needs. Changing of the bag is easy and mess-free. At first I thought it would suck having an old-school vacuum bag (unlike today's &#34;just empty the dirt out of the canister&#34;) but NO! It's all super easy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this vacuum."
2,"The vacuum does a good job and does have terrific suction.  But the hose is very flimsy and is constantly getting kinks (which makes it get REALLY noisy till you straighten it out).  Then the wand. right where you need to put your hand to grab it. has a 'Slip Ring' which you can open to reduce suction (like for doing drapes).  Problem is that it's always opening up so you have to stop to shut it.  These two things get very annoying."
2,"I LOVE THIS VACUUM. it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes. Eureka has a winner on it's hands. I especially LOVE the old 'tank' design as opposed to the current square 'canister' design all vacuums companies are now using. Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market. So many pluses  but just to name a few...extra long cord. massive suction. long hose.I only have 1 negative comment:When vacuuming you are restricted to back and forth straight line vacuuming and I could see how this would be an issue for some."
2,"Purchased the 3670G via Amazon. Just arrived and immediately plugged it into my Kill-A-Watt. The device shows amperage draw on anything plugged into it and it shows the Mite is only drawing 10amps.Either I received the 10amp model that other reviewers have posted about (old reviews though... two year old reviews) or the mfg is lying about it's capabilities.Having said all that. it's a nice. simple. lightweight machine that really sucks (in a good way). but I can't help but wonder how much better it would perform if it was truly the 12amp model.If any other reviewers have any advice. please post a comment."
2,"This is a wonderful vacuum for hardwood floors (or tile. viynl ect.) will not work on carpet so don't even try.  Makes handy vacuum to clean up after small projects like hanging blinds(saw dust).We have two dogs and 2000 plus Sq ft of hardwoods in our new home and my wife was going crazy trying to keep them clean with swiffers. bought her this on amazon and recieved it in 2 days (prime) we botha are tall (5'10' and 6'4') and love the long handle no more bending over. wish the brush attachments were better but we have extra from our other vacuums.Again for hard surfaces this is a 5 star all the way."
2,"Bought this vacuum cleaner for those hard-to-reach places which I can't get to with the upright.  The canister is light and easy to carry around. the tools are also very light (to the point of being a bit flimsy) and do the job.  The strength of suction can be adjusted using a simple rotating collar on the tool extension tube but it is not a snug fit so it tends to move rather too easily during cleaning.  The general level of suction however is good and it picks up most dust and dirt without trouble.  It does seem to work especially well on tile."
2,"Nice and easy to handle machine with a strong motor. easy to clean filter and good accessory package.  Overall this is a good little vacuum for cleaning stairs and car interiors. However. it has 2 problems.  First. the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily.  It has no reinforcing. so you don't want to step on it or bend it around a corner.  Second. the hose is a corrugated pipe style with accordion pleats the entire length.  This gives the hose a little strength. but it makes it very prone to clogs and things sticking in the folds.  I have learned to check the vacuum suction each time I use it.  If it feels weak. I need to take off the hose and shake it clean.  In good clean condition. it works as well as any canister."
2,"The suction on this little machine is unreal.  Sure. the parts are made of plastic and with careless throwing around. parts will break.  But if you are careful and don't step on the hose. you'll find this is a gem.  I have no carpets; just 2 throw rugs with non-rubber backing.  The 'carpet' feature totally cleans these rugs.  The floor feature is just what I need for my 2 floors of hardwood.  And the price?  OMG. if it quits in 2 years. I will have gotten my money's worth."
2,"Needed a small. light duty. vacuum for our store.  After checking various reviews. purchased this item from Amazon.  It is compact. lightweight. has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag. which I prefer.  It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord.  We use it for bare floors and low-pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations.  Three minor. non deal-breaking negative elements are - 1) the hose and tubes are friction fit and can disconnect easily; 2) The hose is corregated plastic and seems a bit cheap; 3)the power cord has a wrap-up rather than retractable storage mechanism.  But. the cord wrap-up holder is well designed and located.  I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed.  All. in all. this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive. convenient vacuum."
2,"This is an awesome little machine for the money. Yea... The plastic is a little cheap and it is a little loud but you cannot beat the price or the power. It is perfect for hard surface floors. No it does not leave marks on wood floors. If you drag the cord under the wheels you'll get a mark from the wax on the cord but most people with a hint of intelligence should know better. No the canister does not easily tip over. I honestly don't know where some of these silly reviews are coming from. This is a great little vacuum for the price. If you want perfect go spend two hundred dollars."
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
2,"The vacuum is very light and powerful enough for bare floors. I've owned a few of them. One burnt out because the person using it was trying to save on bags and repeatedly let it get too full.  Another one lost a wheel. but it is so light it is easy to carry. Most of all the light weight makes it so that I am never reluctant to take it out and use it as I might be with a heavier vacuum.  It has a surprising amount of power. but I am not sure you would want it as your only vacuum for rugs. It is certainly not the vacuum you would buy for extensive wall-to-wall carpeting.  The previous ones I've owned have lasted for very many years."
2,"This is my second Eureka.  The first a Eureka  100 - a BIG Floor standing Model.  This died on me after fifteen years.  Was too big and heavy.The Mighty Mite was ordered and delivered within one week.Tried it out the same day - This machine S U C K S !! (I mean the DUST)The lightweight is very handy.  Did my 3 Bedroon unit with upstairs and stairs without much effort.  The extra brushes. and long handle and tubes are very good for window sills and odd corners.  Does hard floors well.The free shippind was a great help.  With a little addition to qualify for FREE SHIPPING - I got the Bissell Featherweight Bagless. which I ordered together for areally great deal.A very good buy through Amazon.  Very Happy with machine. Thanks Amazon for assisting  in the Free Shipping."
2,"I am very happy with this cordless vacuum.  I had previously purchased the Hoover Linx (approx $150) - which I loved.  However. the Linx roller stopped working within a year.  I purchased a second Linx - which also had had a problem with the roller.  So. I began looking for a much cheaper vacuum that would work. but be much cheaper to replace when needed.  The Eureka does not pick up as well as the Linx (which picked up as quickly as a standard vacuum). but it does pick up most items on a single swipe.  Heavier items may need 3 or 4 swipes with a change of direction.  I've had the Eureka for several months and it is working well.  All things considered. this is a much better value than the Hoover Linx."
2,"I've been using this for 1 and a half year.Batteries still charges fine and I can vacuum whole house (1200 sqft) with 2 batteries which comes with the vacuum.It's totally handy and vacuum well for hairs include pet's hairs which I really like it.It doesn't vacuum small rocks nor coins.The handle and the tank became really flimsy after a year of use. the dust tank doesn't fit to the body anymore. so it falls off easily.I am thinking to purchase the different vacuum soon.I hope this review helps :)"
2,"I bought this because my mom had one when I lived at home. and when I moved out on my own. I couldn't live without one. I believe this is the best cordless vacuum out there for the price. (I've tried Shark vacuums and they were awful.) The suction is great. It doesn't miss anything. It mounts easily on the wall. It's easy to dump the dust bin. The battery lasts long enough for me to vacuum three rooms using the carpet setting. I will own one of these for the rest of my life!PS: These make awesome housewarming or wedding gifts."
2,"One messy African Grey together with a kibble-strewing canine in a kitchen where bread is baked 3-4 times a week was driving me nuts. I was so tired of schlepping out the Dyson 2-3 times a day to vacuum the above mentioned mess. The Eureka Quick Up Cordless is my new best friend. It was ridiculously easy to assemble and mount the charger. The bonus battery pack ensures there is always plenty of power to get the job done. Because the Eureka Quick Up wasn't designed to suck the chrome off a truck's fender. don't expect it to take the place of a traditional vacuum. For those little messes that make you tired of dragging out and plugging in the big guns. the Eureka Quick Up is friggin' awesome!"
2,"I have a very large apartment with all bare floors. Once a week I sweep and use a dustbuster to pick up the piles. then wash all the floors using the Twist n Shout mop system. During that week. I use the dustbuster to just go over the floors between washings. Bending over using the dustbuster would just kill my back. I used this machine Sunday for the first time-wow-it's as strong as the dustbuster but I don't have to bend down at all. Today I used it again and got perfect results. I have a 55 lb. dog and it picks up all his hair with ease. I took the handle off and vacuumed my couch. I couldn't believe all the dog hair it swept up from the couch because I didn't even see the hair on the couch and my dog is black. Only reason to keep my dustbuster is to get behind the toilet and my tv stand. The Eureka doesn't fit there. Great Product!"
2,"This little Eureka vac works well for me to pick up cat litter. crumbs. and easily tackles quick clean ups on the hard surface floors around my home. It also works well to get pet hair off both carpeted and fabric surfaces; I've used the beater brush setting on my couch and has the couch looking new again every time. On carpets it does a good job grabbing surface dirt except when *really* close to the baseboards. I find it lightweight and easy to handle for quick tasks.I love that it came with two batteries so it's always ready to go. I don't use the extended handle portions so for me this stores in a really compact space. The beater brush setting can be on on or off. The dust cup is relatively easy to empty.This model provides just enough power for the tasks I need it to do and I leave the bigger tasks to my full size vacuum. Pleased with this purchase and recommended for light cleaning tasks on all flooring types and low to medium height carpet."
2,"It's a stick vacuum. folks. So it won't do much more on carpet than collect surface debris (like any stick vac. it's not designed to. though it does have a &#34;carpet&#34; setting) or solve big cleaning problems. But it will. from solid floors. remove crumbs. most dust bunnies smaller than bowling balls. dog and cat hair. and -- for those like us who have canaries or other pet birds -- all 2.000 feathers that each one of those little darlings drops during their annual molt.What I like best is that this model comes with TWO batteries. so I can keep one in the stick vac and one in the charger so the help I need is always at hand. For the price. I like this machine."
2,"I needed a vacuum but was at a loss because there are so many to choose from.  But one day in the doctor's office. I saw a clip of an asthma prevention program in California and they were recommending Eureka because unlike other vacuums. it doesn't blow the dust back out. Although this is not the exact same model. I like the portability of a cordless and it's a strong vacuum.  I have two dogs and I can get the whole apartment clean and it doesn't even lose its charge so I haven't used the spare battery yet.  It's easy to maneuver and there are two settings. one for carpet and one for bare floors.  It's also relatively quiet."
2,"When this first arrived. I was a bit disappointed by how unsubstantial this little machine felt. but I've just used it for the first time. and the second it hit the rug. I could feel a surprising amount of power. And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power. And when I emptied the dust cup (which was incredibly easy to do. by the way. and your hand goes on the inside of the cup. while the dirt is stuck to the outside. so your hands don't have to ever touch the dust) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up!I have a small one-bedroom apartment with very little storage space. and this tucks away easily behind the closet door.Well done. Eureka!"
2,"We're pretty pleased with this vacuum - it cleans our rug (it's a felt-type of material so it has very little pile) and cleans our wood floors well. I like that it has 2 battery packs - we've never had the disappointment of picking the vacuum up and realizing it's out of charge. The only issue was the first time I emptied it. dust flew all over me when I removed the cup from the vacuum. Also. the screw somehow came out of our handle and won't stay in anymore so the handle is pretty much useless now until we find a nut to use. The brush got pretty wrapped up in hair. but it was easy to cut free. Overall. a solid vacuum. but nothing insanely life changing."
2,"I bought this vacuum to keep bedroom and bathroom floors tidy.  All three people living in my house have long. brown hair and I can't stand when it gets on the floor!  The vacuum works well for touch up jobs. but it wouldn't work for heavy duty clean ups (like our pet rabbits room which gets covered with hay and fur..).  The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was that the hair got wrapped around the roller of the vacuum instead of being sucked up into the compartment and was very gross and tedious to remove!  It's perfect for use on the stairs. however. because it only weighs about 4 pounds!  As for the battery life-- I can vacuum about 2 medium sized rooms and a hallway before the battery wears out.  Definitely glad this one came with an extra battery so it can be switched out if you need to vacuum more."
2,"The vacuum is light weight. and picks up dirt and hair quite well.  It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.  The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.  I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.  The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging. but it's designed for wall hanging. and it slides on the counter. and the shape is not made for flat surfaces."
2,"This is a great cordless vac. I have two dogs and this picks up all the hair without getting clogged! (works great on floors- medium success with carpet so if you have carpet this may not be your solution). I have an Electrolux that was specifically advertised to be good for people with dogs- what a waste of money- it clogs with the first pass- don't make the same mistake.  The Eureka is very reasonable priced and does a great job.  It's also pretty quiet for a vacuum and my dog who is terrified of the regular vacuum is not bothered by this at all."
2,"This vac is amazing for picking up dog hair. broken wine glasses (who said that? :). leaves that blow into the house. crumbs. party remnants. etc.... I can't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you've just mopped - get this! It's a two minute swish through the house and it's all picked up - it's amazing. My son actually loves it because it's 'just his size' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well. if you insist! :)  I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you're taller then 5&#34;5' you will be scrunching yourself to use this. Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg. should man up and make it up to par."
2,"If you've never tried a stick vac. I highly recommend them.  Super great for quick pick-ups or a run-thru when company is coming.  I have owned several stick vacs over the years but this one tops them all.  The extra battery comes in handy and the clear top makes it easy to see when the brush needs cleaned.  Hang this near your mess area and make clean up quick and life simple.  It does a great job on hard surface flooring or carpeting."
2,"First- I love this light weight vac but it does have a couple of cons that lowered the rating.Con 1- has a hard time picking up little leaves or kitty fur ( which seems to tangle up the rollers easily..)con2. Do NOT buy unless you get two batteries. I have tried everything but the battery life is not anywhere as described and if I hadn't received a second battery I probably would have returned this item.The pro is it does still pick up other stuff pretty well and its so light weight .UPDATE:Increased the star rating due to excellent customer support from Eureka direct.  Notified them of the charging issues and they were awesome and provided the type of customer service that we rarely see anymore.  Hoping a new charging unit and batteries will improve the use time  but regardless.. customer serviced  from Eureka has me believing that if I ever have more problems. they stand behind their product"
2,"I have birds. so before getting this stick vacuum. I was sweeping my carpet area every night around their cages. This vacuum works beautifully. and picks up things very well. It's not a &#34;suction&#34; type &#34;vacuum&#34;. but it does a great job mimicking one. The other great thing is this comes with TWO batteries. so you are never without power.  I had a stick vacuum years ago (different brand). and it only had one battery. so if the battery died before finishing. you were screwed. and had to recharge.  With this. if your power dies out. you have another one waiting. and you continue on.  I can vacuum my living room area. the hall. etc.. maybe three nights before it starts to sound low. So it has a good longevity to the battery. Again. I love this thing! I'm so happy I bought this!"
2,"I bought this to clean up the bits of cat litter my cat tracks onto the bathroom floor  when he jumps out of his litter box.  For this it works stupendously.  I haven't tried it on carpet or as a hand-held. but it seems to be durable and have plenty of suction power. and it has brushes you can turn on for use on carpet.  The extra battery pack is a bonus. tho' I haven't run down the first battery pack yet.  The battery seems to last a long time."
2,"I love everything about this vacuum. The mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery. I can do the upstairs and downstairs in a small home one one of the batteries. Really lightweight - easy to pull out and use. I hate traditional vacuum cleaners because of the noise. but this is really quiet and light.It is powerful enough for hardwood floors and wool rugs. I have a shop vac. so if anything major were to happen. it's there. You'd really be better off with a shop vac than a regular vacuum if something major were to happen anyway. Between the two vacs. it's perfect.It's so lightweight. carrying it up and down the stairs is nothing. but if you have the mounting space and a few extra bucks. you might want to pick up a couple of these."
2,"I'll start by saying that I think we may have received a faulty unit. The canister/filter didn't sit right when clicked into place. which may have been affecting the suction power. We ended up returning it.That said. I still would have probably returned this vac even if it wasn't faulty. The reason being. there are much higher-quality vacs available for not a lot more money. We ended up with an Electrolux Ergorapido. which is so much better made in comparison (there is no comparison. really.)Plus. the &#34;handheld&#34; function of this vac is a joke - all you do is remove the &#34;stick&#34; handle. so the head of the vac when in handheld mode is the same huge head as when it is in upright mode. Most other dual-mode models have a removable &#34;dust buster&#34; style vac with a smaller head for nooks and crannies. Not this Eureka!"
2,"I had trepidations about the power of this device. especially since it had a carpet brush.  I thought. as battery powered.at first. something has to give as a tradeoff.....either power or run-time.  Well. all worries came to ease after it's initial charge of 16-hours.  This broom is a little powerhouse.  It is perfect for our use. which is. to pick up stray cat litter.  It not only achieves this. but also serves to pick up crumbs or just about any small items from a hardwood or low-pile carpeted floor.  Run-time is fabulous.  It has run for more than fifteen minutes. with no degradation of power. on the initial battery.  if one has to sweep longer than this. of course. the battery can be changed with the charged one in less than ten-seconds.  Highly recommend."
2,"This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I bought the last one several years ago and it is still running strong.  I wanted a second one to keep upstairs.  This little Quick Up is exactly as advertised. What a time saver.  It is  light and weight has considerable suction for a cordless.  It is a little Go To machine and I think anyone would be glad they purchased it.  This would be a great gift I think anyone would be delighted to receive.change"
2,"this is my 3rd Eureka Quick Pick Up cordless sweeper. They are great for picking up cat and dog hair and light floor cleaning. I use it daily as I have 2 inside cats.. I would not recommend it for heavy duty carpet cleaning as it is not powerful enough to do a thorough job.It's easy to clean the filter cup but is a little dirty to do so. Just empty the filter cup. rinse it out and the container and allow it to dry before placing on the sweeper.I am pleased it has an extra battery. The previous two did not.If you want a light weight easy to use cordless sweeper. you won't be disappointed"
2,"I'm surprised at the power this little cordless has! It picks up the dirt. dog hair and even little pebbles. A single battery lasts a long time. and with the spare battery ready. I can actually keep my place easily quick-swept. (I'm more a gardener. not a cleaner. so if it's not easy it probably won't happen.) Some cons: the filter case is a little difficult to remove. it would be nice if the 'on' button was up on the handle instead of down on the base. and although the stick comes off for stair cleaning. it doesn't have a 'Dust Buster-like' snout like. say the Electrolux Pronto (which doesn't have the same power). It does clean so well. I'd recommend getting a spare filter or two (they're cheap) so you can rinse one out and have another ready. I'm so glad I got this!"
2,"I was totally amazed to find out this uses NiCad batteries that suffer from battery memory and are horrid.  I had to call Eureka and get new batteries sent. the first customer service agent was horrible and made me call back 24 hours later in the event the batteries suddenly started to work.  NiCad batteries are horrible.  The Vac itself is great. but the batteries make it not worth owning.Among rechargeable battery technologies. NiCad rapidly lost market share in the 1990's. to NiMH and Li-ion batteries; market share dropped by 80% for good reason.  With the battery technology today there is no reason Eureka should have used them except to be cheap."
2,"We retired in Florida and about half of our flooring is tile.  We needed a stick vacuum that would properly sweep the tile floor so we could then steam clean it with another device.  It's quick and easy to use and it weighs very little.  When done. we put it on the charger and it is ready for the next time we have a need for it.  It does take about 16 hours to fully charge the batteries. but it's not really  a problem. since we don't use it every day.  The extra battery should come in handy over time. since all batteries lose their ability to hold a charge.  I suspect that it will take a year or two (or more) before we have to buy a new battery. which is available for purchase through Eureka.  This cordless stick vacuum is exactly what we needed and it was a good purchase."
2,"It is so easy to use. I can stand in one spot and vacuum a large area at one time.  Having two batteries is great. as the one in it (not in the charging holder) goes down quickly. but the back-up finishes my house.  Three problems:  1.  There's a screw on the side between the handle and the bottom that won't stay screwed in.  2.  The bristles have to be checked every time to clean it. with my  shoulder-length hair.  3.  The dust holder just barely stays on the unit; the button that holds it in place barely fits right.It was real easy to put together from the box.But it picks up great and fast and easy. and always amazes me that I can make such a mess to fill the filter!"
2,"The biggest problem in cleaning spots and stains out of furniture and area rugs is lugging around a heavy piece of equipment. This Hoover is small enough to carry with ease and fills simply from the top. It even has a  built in mechanism so it can't overflow. I liked its performance overall  and found it as good. if not better then other household machines. Of  course it seems to work best with the cleaner it came with but since it's  an economical product that isn't a problem either. The best feature it has  is two separate tanks which means you won't end up cleaning your sofa with  dirty water. Overall this product is a good investment and pasys for itself  in one use."
2,"With a one year old and two year old around the house. there is no end of messes. spills. leaking diapers.etc. I've used this to clean spoiled milk out of the bottom of our truck. clean up poopie off the carpet. scrub juice off the living room floor and it does a MAGNIFICENT job!! i would buy it a hundred times over. I highly recommend it for small jobs that don't require professional cleaning. It'll definately get you through and do a better than expected job"
2,"No assembly and ready to go out of box.  2 ounce of cleaner and 1/2 gallon hot water to fill the unit through a convenient fill hole.  Unit does not have to be disassembled to empty. a convenient drain spout.After first use. waste water came out black. and an immediate elimination of pet odor in the stairway.Small size and light weight make it idea for immediate spill clean ups.Unit is built top heavy with a large handle. this balances the weight when solution is in the unit.Cord could be longer and retractable."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
2,"Just received my Steamvac Jr. today and had pet stains waiting to be cleaned.  After they'd been around for a few weeks this little device didn't hold back the cleaning power.  Suction is awesome and I was so impressed I started to find things I wanted to clean...couch pillows. etc.  I just couldn't stop!  I'd recommend to anyone who's considering a handy. powerful tool of this nature.  (One note of caution...I didn't have the handles locked down all the way...my fault...and when lifting it off the counter after filling it up. it all hit the floor!!  Be aware of TWO locks. not one...)  It does come with a small bottle of cleaning agent which worked just fine but I purchased one separately anyway.  Enjoy!"
2,"It's does not vac at all.  I am going to get a canister vac like my friends from Eurica. they worked great.  Uprights are always too loud and does not clean well.  My only good vac was the upright that's cordless.  It does not clean very well. but does the everyday job of picking up dirt.  My ex-wife got it and still using it.  I need to get one.  Wasted hundreds on Hoover and Dirt Devil's upright too.  Purchase 3 Hoover in my life time and are not happy.  3 strikes. your out Hoover.  I'll get a Eureka canister vac for sure."
2,"Because of the many favorable reviews I bought this little vac last week.  I also ordered the Advanced Deep Cleaner with protector and I was AMAZED with the results. I've had a beige sofa bed that was dangerously close to be thrown away like garbage after several years of all types of kid abuse. My sofa looks brand new. smells great and it's soft and fluffy.The machine is noisy. but it's not as bad as I expected. The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it. The brush washed away even old ink stains (I soaked them in alcohol for a few minutes before cleaning)Thanks to this little wonder is cheap. easy to use and very effective."
2,"I purchased this timer to replace an earlier version of the same timer that stopped working.  I started out looking for a different brand. but this one was the lowest cost option.The pros:+  Low cost + free Amazon shipping!+  Easy installation & the dial plate fits over the existing switch opening.+  Easy to operate. with the exception noted below.+  Quiet operation... the fan noise is louder.The cons:-  No manual off?  It's odd they removed the manual off feature that we got used to on the earlier version of this timer.-  The knob is a bear to push on & just as difficult to remove!  I suggest installing & removing the knob a few times to loosen it up. before installing the timer.&#9658; Update - January 9. 2014This timer has been working perfectly since we installed it.  We still miss the manual off feature. :("
2,"Easy to install.  Did it myself - female with VERY limited electrical experience but I am good with tools.It works.  We haven't' had it that long so I can't speak to longevity but it is currently doing what it's supposed to be doing.  It's installed in our main bathroom and it gets a lot of use.Directions were very easy to follow and it looks ok when installed. I mean it looks exactly like the picture. nothing fancy or especially decorative.We bought 3 more for other fans."
2,"I bought 4 of these units from Home Depot in 2005 while building a new home; I paid 15 bucks each.  I use them to automatically shut-off three bathroom fans and a laundry room fan (Broan-NuTone QTREN080 80 CFM. 0.8 Sones. Energy Star Fan).  The timer instructions and face plate say to turn the nob passed 10 minutes (at least). which I do.  They still work great after 6 years.They were easy to install.  And they shut-off the fans consistently.  No complaints.  I would purchase one of these again. if it ever failed."
2,"I have been using this timer for about 5 years and just purchased 3 more at the request of neighbors who wanted one for their apartments.  Mine is used to time the hot water heater for my daily shower and has more than paid for itself in savings on the electricity bill.  Previously it was necessary to manually turn on and off the heater and invariably  it remained on longer than necessary. to the detriment of my electricity bill.  The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability.  I realize that nothing last forever. but after 5 years of daily use mine shows no sign of advancing age.Timers are also available for shorter periods. but I see no benefit in buying one of them.  This timer gives me the option of a full hour. but also permits running the timer for any period less than that.If you need a timer. this is a very good choice."
2,"Strong. stable. stackable. 'nestable' - these boxes have it all... except labels.  Would be nice if Akro included a few labels for the front... they do. but they want you to pay for them. so I'll just cut out some card stock.  These also can mount to the Akro wall-system which is nice. and may be the way I build my next garage work bench.  Currently they're sitting on the bench stacked 3 high.  I liked them so much I placed a second order!"
2,"Quick and easy setup -- no installation required. even though it comes with screws. Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary. At long last. i finally have my multitude of brooms/mops/swiffers/dusters/dust pans OFF the floor and out of the way every time i open the closet door. A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality. nice and sturdy. I like that it is white so blends in with my white door. Highly reccommend."
2,"I live in an apartment. so I wanted something that I could hang over the door instead of drilling/nailing things into the wall for me to fill later when I move out. It was really hard to find! This comes with the hardware to mount if you want to. which is nice if/when I go somewhere more permanent. but honestly. hanging it over the door is working great. Why drill holes when you don't need to? It was a little difficult getting the bracket attached to the peg part. I ended up using a hammer which caused some of the white paint to come off. but you really can't see it and it doesn't affect function. I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
2,"We purchased these bags for the first time in May 2001.  I installed a bag and thought it worked OK.  (I did not throw the former bags. not Hoover bags. out.)  The next time the bag needed changing the lady who cleans the house (unbeknown to us) installed the bag we had been using previously.  My wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference.  After a very short time my wife said she could smell the dust when the vacuum cleaner was in use.  I changed the bag in our vacuum back to a Hoover bag and the probem was cured.  While not very scientific. it convinced us.  I have thrown the other bags away.Additional Comment:Because of the small particles that are trapped in the bag. I take the vacuum outside to remove the filled bag.  This prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house."
2,"This will be short. it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums. it's OEM. it works. no manufacturing or quality issues. If your vacuum uses this size. I see no reason not to get it. As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run. and it has been running for over a decade. I will get these replacements. Thanks to Amazon for making these so easy to acquire. would have had a hard time locally. otherwise.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
2,"There was a review titled &#34;Didn't Fit&#34; which stated:&#34;Be warned! If you are looking for the &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; bag for a Hoover Wind Tunnel vac. don't assume a &#34;Type Z&#34; bag will fit....it won't!&#34;I don't doubt the reviewer got a product which doesn't fit.  Maybe hoover does weird things.  I double checked. and the previous bags I used were &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; - the last one is still in the vacuum.  I replaced that one with this Type Z - fit just fine.  So. I'm not sure what happened with the poor fellow which got ones which didn't fit. but worked just fine for me.It's the genuine hoover product. not the knockoffs sold on here as well.  I figured - why bother saving fifty cents a bag or whatever. when these bags last months.  Not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly."
2,"Awesome pick up power for pet hair.  Does an excellent job cleaning carpets.  I would have given it 5 stars but it overheated on the 3rd use.  I e-mailed hoover and they said to make sure  all filters are clean. I discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged.  The new routine is to check that filter when dumping the canister. No overheat problems with a clean filter. The Hoover folks said that the motor needs lots of air flow to keep it cool. Really impressed with how much dirt it removes from the carpet."
2,"The belts as such are excellent but the Hoover keeps killing them every few months.  My wife uses it carefully but the belt is so tightly stretched around the pegs it is bound to snap and thats what happens.  There got to be much better design.  I had to buy several belts and keep in stock but now I am really fed up with the above Hoover vacuum about this!  I have an older Hoover which has been working since 1988 without a hitch. really.  They do not make things like that any more!!!!!"
2,"I bought this vacuum cleaner belt because I do not need it. Have you ever needed a vacuum cleaner belt? Have you ever needed one IN A HURRY? I had a Kenmore that was the best carpet vacuum I have ever seen. but the belt broke. I didn't have another. I put off looking for one. I moved to an apartment with all wood floors and discarded the Kenmore. Now I have area rugs and a Hoover that just isn't as nice and I can't find bags for it anywhere but Amazon. So I bought the bags here. and the belt too because it was inexpensive and I have bad memories of lacking the vacuum cleaner belt. So now I have this Hoover that I hate too. And if it breaks its belt. I have one on hand so I can go on hating this vacuum cleaner for ever. I even ordered a new hose for it."
2,"I have the Hoover Windtunnel Max vacuum cleaner and these belts fit. Buy them in advance. because my vacuum cleaner picked up a blanket and I pulled it out when the vacuum cleaner was still on. You are supposed to turn off the vacuum cleaner. then pull out the blanket. Well. that was one of the first times I vacuumed with my Hoover and it ruined the belt. and I needed a replacement right there on the spot. I had one. because I went and bought this 2-pack along with my Hoover. A good practice."
2,"For some strange reason. I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep if this fan isn't on.  It doesn't matter if it's snowing outside. this fan has to be on.I have been using it for 2 years and it still works great.  I rarely use the high setting because I have a small room. but the low setting is great for sleeping because it isn't very loud.My only complaint. as will ALL fans that I've owned. are that they get dusty rather quickly and are difficult to clean.  You have to unscrew the plastic screens. wipe the fan blade. hose down the screens. and screw them pack on."
2,"i have for over two years the lasko box fan that i use in bedroom and it works very well.but being an idiot when i came to amazon to order another one i was too lazy to look up my old order and ordered this one becuse 'it looks the same'.  its not.  the 3723 model from two years ago is fabulous.. really cools a mid size room.  this newer model you have to be within 2 feet to even feel any aire.  buy the 3723http://www.amazon.com/Lasko-20-Inch-Premium-Box-3-SPEED/dp/B000HHJ2I2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1344856518&sr;=8-1&keywords;=lasko+3723"
2,"inexpensive fan. works just fine. i bought this for white noise when i sleep. and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine. moves air too. but since that is not what i use it for. i can not speak for it's abilities at that task.side note. the fan came packed only in it's original box. and the first one was cracked and broken. i sent it back. got another. and. and. and... the second one was broken also. it didn't affect the fan really. so i called amazon. got a 10 dollar credit. and kept it. they said they would be flagging the company. whatever that means. never a problem with returns etc at amazon. but since this is a review of the product. not the packaging. there is no star reduction."
2,"Nice to see Made in the USA on the outside of the Lasko 20' box the fan arrived in!Delivery was before scheduled and caught me and my two cats by suprize! Cats have nice new box to play with and I have great smooth operating and quiet cooling Lasko 20' box fan just the right size for my apartment. If you run it on the highest speed naturally it is a little louder. This fan delivers the goods.goods in this case being circulating cool air. Appreciate the prompt delivery also. You may wonder why the early review since having the fan only a couple hours.well the reason is I trust Lasko for a good product since my previous fan was a Lasko I have used for the last 10 years! Motor just wore out after good work for 10 years. Thanks Lasko!"
2,"From now on. I'll always look for a Lasko 3733 when I need to replace a fan. I bought my first one 5 years ago and it ran 24/7 365 days a year. It took 5 years of continuous use before one of the ball bearings wore out. FIVE YEARS of 24/7/365 use! This is a superb fan!This fan is very well balanced. It never wobbles or shakes.This fan is not a quiet as I'd like. but then again. I want perfection and that's not going to happen. It  is quiet enough on the slow setting. and making a fan spin faster does nothing to move air faster (believe it or don't. this is pure physics).Cleaning of this fan is very easy. Simply remove the grill screws. then remove the grills. Then unscrew the blade holder. and pull the blades off the spindle. Wash in hot. soapy water. Replace everything. then turn it on so that it drys itself."
2,"My concern while purchasing this fan was air flow.  Needed a substitute air conditioner for the summertime.  Needed something that could create alot of air movement to suck in the cool air at night. and something that could be aimed at me could cool me off during the day. and this fan achieves that for it's lower price.  Box fans are great. place then in a window and they'll cool a room down in no time.  It is not a quiet fan like the ultra quiets on the market today but it is not as loud as those turbo jet fans.  It has a normal good size fan noise that I don't find irritating.  Other than that. you really don't need the foot attachments.  I placed on the desk. turned on high and it did not fall over.  So. to conclude it is a good solid fan for a reasonable price when your main concern is air flow."
2,"I just bought one of these from Target. This fan is LOUD and makes waaay too much noise.  Even at the lowest setting. this fan sounds like an airplane is getting ready to take off.  I'm not exagerating.This fan is LOUD !!!  Forget about sleeping with this fan on at night.  I am even worried the neighbors can hear it at night.The noise is awful --  and a bad surprise when you need to use it. My parents always had a couple of these box fans around and they never made anywhere near this kind of noise.  The construction is all plastic.  They dont make them like they used to.I dont get it -- the electric fan technology has been around since 1900 --why is the product getting worse and more expensive ???Save your money and buy something else."
2,"This is a fine. basic box fan.  I don't want the fan to be too quiet. and this one isn't.  The low is low. and the high blocks out other noises. I use the fan both to move air into the house and to block out white noise. and this one does the trick.But it's a basic box fan.  There is no thermostat. The three modes are not particularly 'whisper quiet'. as I've heard other box fans quieter and less powerful.There's a knob on the top with three speeds and two plastic feet to help keep it from falling over.That's all.Which is exactly what I needed. for about the cheapest price I could find here on Amazon.It's just not really what the description notes."
2,"Mine arrived crushed because there's no package padding (should be double boxed).  I fixed it myself because I didn't want to return it. by bending it back into shape (it's sort of flimsy. so it wasn't hard).  But. it's too loud for the bedroom even on low.  And. it smells of an oil/electrical smell when it is turned on. yuck.  I have it turned on outside to try to work out the smell (no. it's not rubbing or smoking or anything).I'm trying to replace a Holmes box fan that burnt out after years of use.  The Holmes was extremely quiet on low. and had the added benefit of a rotatable angled vent that could blow diagonally from the window into the room at the side.  Sadly I can't find a direct replacement for my old fan. and this one isn't going to fit the bill."
2,"Our air conditioning went out on the hottest day of the year so far. So we bought a few fans so we could survive until we could get someone to fix the problem. This fan is good for putting in front of a window to draw in cool air. It is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler. As far as this having 3 quiet speeds I'd have to say that is not quite accurate. It is not a silent fan as it does make some noise. But for the price it does a good job. One thing however is that this fan scares my cats. It might take some time for your animals to get used to the noise.~The Rebecca Review"
2,"I love this fan. We bought it years ago and have never had a problem with it. It's pretty simple to figure out. It has three settings: High. medium. low. This is great to put in a window to circulate some fresh air. It runs pretty quietly on the low and medium settings but can get a little loud on high (which is kind of expected).Overall. this is a purchase I have not regretted. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a durable fan. You could probably find it a lot cheaper in a local store. I got mine at Dollar General."
2,"For years. hubby and I have bought Lasko fans to keep in our bedroom.  This is our third one.We use it to keep the air circulating and for the white noise to help me sleep.None of the three that we've owned have had any whining. squeaking. rattling or weird noises.  Just a nice. smooth hum.It does blow hard.The first one died because I let it get too dusty.  The second one lasted for 7 years and I only replaced it because my son needed a fan and I wanted a shiny new one for myself."
2,"I have been sleeping with a box fan in my bedroom  year round for many. many years and have owned several different models but this one tops them all. I can turn up my thermostat in the summer and still stay cool and comfy. in the winter it helps  circulate the warm air in the house. I have a teenage son at home and when he has friends who sleep over they can be a bit noisy sometimes. However. with my Lasko fan turned on the number 2 setting I don't hear them and my son's bedroom is right across the hall from mine. This being said. if you are looking for a quiet fan then I suggest you buy another brand. However. if you want to lower your electric bill and block out noise then this is the one to buy. You can't go wrong with this Lesko!! I reccomend it highly!"
2,"I. like many people. have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep. I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted. I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new. I use mine and my son uses his. every night on low when we sleep. All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be. According to my kill-a-watt. this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low. You can calculate more from there if you would like. My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually. The only problem is like all my other fans. the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago. I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home."
2,"I have had my WM 6qt for 11 months. The ice cream was great but the motor has stopped working. BE AWARE THAT AMAZON only warranties this product for 30 days. The manufactures warranty for the motor is one year. I now have to go to the hassle of contacting White Mountain and securing service for a product that they did not sell to me. I anticipate issues. For a unit that cost this much the seller should back it for the indicated periods.White Mt was very easy to deal with and did replace the motor. I only gope is that it last longer. Great Ice Cream."
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
2,"This is the real thing! I have tried other ice cream makers and this thing worked flawlessly out of the box and makes real ice cream even in a hot and humid environment with ambient temperatures of about 33 degrees Celsius and  85% humidity in a RESTAURANT kitchen and I have been using this everyday to make at least 2 or 3 batches everyday!Would definitely recommend it. A durable item that holds up in today's disposable times. A bit on the loud side as in other reviews but in a restaurant kitchen. who cares as long as it does the job reliably!"
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
2,"I didn't fully realize how nice this peeler is until I was at my mother's over Christmas and tried to use two of hers.  They were slippery. dull. and they HURT to use!  I had never understood that one peeler really could be better than another before that.This peeler is comfortable to hold. even at the end of a big job like peeling apples for a pie or potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner. It is sharp. so you don't have to use a lot of pressure. which also helps decrease hand fatigue.  All-in-all. a good product.** Update 8/18/11: I'm back to purchase two of these as stocking stuffers for my mother. No excuses -- now she can throw out those peelers that have been hanging around since I was a kid. . ."
2,"I love this peeler!  I had one just like it for many years (until I somehow lost it!) and it worked perfectly EVERY time.  I couldn't remember where I bought it and couldn't find another one in any stores - until I finally looked on Amazon.  Thank you. Amazon!  Not only is the gripper handle perfect. the blade works as it should.  I purchased a couple other peelers during my quest and I was very disappointed.  Their blades kept slipping over the vegetables without cutting.  Very frustrating.  I even tried a kitchen Aid brand and hated it.  So save yourself the frustration and the tired hands and just buy this one!"
2,"As with all OXO Good Grips products. the handle on this peeler is great.  The blade. however. is less than 2 inches long. making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes. though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers.  Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating. rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers.  In short. this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."
2,"Just like the last post. We had one of these for years. Ours too suddenly disappeared without a trace!  How wierd!Anyway. I went to my local walmart and they did not have this same model. so i settled for what they had in stock. Needless to say. I returned that piece of junk the next day. got a refund. And found one of these at another local store!  I couldnt believe what i had taken for granted in this potato peeler!It is still very sharp after years of use. the handle is very comfortable and the swivel on the blade works perfectly.I dont know what the diff is between this model and the $12 model also made by Oxo. but this one is fantastic!You will get years of use out of this peeler. untill maybe the aliens decide to snatch yours too!"
2,"I've long been a fan of OXO utensils but I didn't think there was a good are bad when it came to peelers. I was wrong. I cook quite a bit and had used a peeler recently at my brother's house. When I got this one and used it. it was like night and day. It is surprisingly effective in peeling as if it were super sharp. but I've run it into my hand on accident a couple times and never been cut. There's something about the design of the blade that makes it pretty safe to use and still really quick at peeling. It also comes with a nifty plastic blade cover that I use to protect the blade from dulling in my utensil drawer. Nice little feature."
2,"If you're not a cook. then you probably won't have a use for this. but anyone in the search of a superior vegetable peeler. look no further. I've had mine for over two years. and it's working as well as the day I purchased it. It doesn't dull. it peels efficiently. it's safe. light. easy to handle. easy to clean. and doesn't rust. It works well with potatoes. carrots. cucumbers. and zucchinis. I've never tried chocolate. though. It's crazily cheap that you should definitely give this product a try. I promise you won't be disappointed."
2,"Peeling has never been more fun!  I love this peeler. It is super easy to peel any kind of fruit I want. I'll never go back to the regular type of peelers or God-forbid dangerous knives. I like peeling potatoes. apples. and carrots.  Sometimes. I buy root vegetables just so I can peel them.  This peeler is ergonomically comfortable. I can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands. (I wear size XS gloves.)  It's not hard to clean either. I just rinse and wipe. along the grain. using a sponge. That does the trick.  I've had this for months and so far no visible grime has built up on it.  It is rust free as the day I bought it.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I am recommending it to you."
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
2,"I'll be honest; I don't get much exposure to a great variety of vegetable peelers. but I would hazard a guess that this is one of the best.I bought this based on the other good Amazon reviews and have not regretted it. Its sharp and very efficiently does its job.My sister came over for Christmas and after using it on a few dozen vegetables was so impressed that she went out the next day to find one of her own. I have a reputation in my family for buying the best of the best. no matter the cost. so she was very surprised to find this peeler was so cheap.Buy it. it just works."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
2,"Bought for 3rd time in November 2012.  Due to misadventures in moving we have had to buy this exact product 3 times.  The grip stays in hand with no slipping even if hand gets wet while using.  Peels excellent with little pressure.  My gal friend has rheumatoid arthritis and this is the only style she can use.  Got stupid once and bought the Kitchen Aid red colored one just because of the color and regretted on 1st use - handle was uncomfortable. slippery. and blades would not peel properly.  The OXO is easy to use. easy to clean. very reliable product and company.  Amazon price slightly better than any other store we researched."
2,"Like many of the &quot;Good Grips&quot; products. it's really astounding how much better this peeler is than &quot;traditional&quot; peelers (you know. the all-metal. slightly rusty thing that had been in your utensil drawer since you bought at at the supermarket when you were stocking the kitchen for your first apartment).  This inexpensive gadget produces much better results. much faster and more comfortably. than any other peeler I've ever used.  It works equally well on potatos. carrots. apples. etc.  It's cheap ($5-$6 for an essential kitchen tool you'll own for years) and works great; why in the world wouldn't you buy it?  If you cook and you don't own one. stop reading and buy one now.  It's a no-brainer."
2,"I purchased the OXO Good Grips Peeler back in 2000 and I have been using it ever since with no problems whatsoever. I originally bought it to replace the peeler that came in my Culinary School tool kit. That peeler had broken after only a month of use. But I have used the OXO peeler ever since. going on 5 years now. It feels great in my hands and peels potatoes. carrots and other vegetables perfectly. While I was in school my classmates were constantly borrowing this from me and asking me where I bought it. Even one of my Chef instructors loved it and would use it from time to time. If this peeler were to ever break on me. which it has shown no signs of doing. I would not hesitate to buy another OXO."
2,"Yup. this is a great peeler.  The handle is sturdy and feels good in the hand.  The 'grips' help avoid slippage with your wet. kitchen hands.  Swivel action helps when peeling uneven surfaces (think potatoes).  The guard over the top of the blade aids in gripping and safety.The peeler I had before this was some cheap little thing I got at the grocery store.  It's definitely worth a few extra bucks to get a real peeler.  Especially if you love sweet potato mash as much as I do!"
2,"This is the best peeler I have used!  I have one and have given them as gifts numerous times. The grip is comfortable. the peeling action is smooth and quick and it just is a joy to use.  What more could you want? My wife  has carpal tunnel and loves the whole line of OXO products. but this one is  our favorite. Even my 11 year old daughter begs me to use it when I peel  vegetables.This is the last peeler you'll ever need!"
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
2,"One would be surprised how rare it is to find a peeler that is actually easy to use. The grip has to be just right. the peeling head has to swivel not too much and not too little and its edges have carry just the right amount of sharpness. I went though a number of peelers which I all eventually abandoned in favor of my trusted knife. However. once I got my hands on one these OXO ones. I never used my knife again.Nowadays. that seems you cannot go through a single day without coming across Food Shows. this swivel peeler is a must in every kitchen.RECOMMENDED."
2,"The day I got this peeler. I compared how it peeled side by side with my other swivel potato peeler. just like an infomercial. or something. The size of the pieces that came off when peeled with the new one was incredible. It takes no time at all to peel a potato. whereas I had to spend at least 10 minutes on it before! I'm surprised that most swivel potato peelers don't have any kind of grip on the handle. because after any length of time. holding it can definitely be hard on your hand. It peels carrots equally well. and it makes cooking much more leisurely and fun."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
2,"I purchased this years ago and have loved it from the start... It's so comfortable to hold. works in both directions - peeling away from your hand or towards your hand. We use it on cucumbers. potatoes. and carrots. Takes off just the right amount of peel with each swipe. It has held up fine in the dishwasher and seems to be still sharp enough. probably 15 years after we bought it... LOVE IT and would highly recommend. The lines you see on the sides of the handle are great for gripping and compress as you squeeze them. so even with wet hands. the peeler does not slip!"
2,"I have about 5 different peelers in my drawer. my last favorite one was similar but the cheaper $1.99 version from walmart but they don't have a higher end product like this. However I love the previous one. it came to rusting due to its cheaply made metal I think. So I'm seeking for a better replacement. I do like most of OXO products like can opener. wine opener etc... One thing I didn't like about previous walmart version is that it peel a bit thicker than I want that it take away more than I want just the fruit's shield. This peel was great. peel thinner. exactly as I wanted. But I hope it'll last much longer for its price and brand that doesn't rust out like the other one.Best peeler I ever have. this would probably a good gift for mother's day."
2,"meh.. it's alright...  Does it peel?  Yes.  I've had mine for a few years now and even had them sharpened.  So. how much can there be to a peeler to make a difference enough to say 'oh yeah baby peel baby peel'?  Not this peeler.  In general I like OXO stuff for their grips and that's about it.Rather than just complain.  Allow me to point you to a peeler that has me reeling peels.Messermeister Peeler Trio SetThe Messermeister is a much better peeler in that it requires hardly any effort with the standard peeler.  It comes individually or as a trio pack.  Of the trio the standard and serrated peelers are the most often used.  The julienne peeler not so much but consider it a freebie at this price.  nogo on this oxo."
2,"I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.  And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.  Everything came out nicely and neatly.  All it took was bit of turning and pushing. and then the whole core came out like a beauty!  I just love it!  Plus. it saves so much time.Yes-- the handle/grip is absolutely well designed.  It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all."
2,"Apple corers have always been a pain.  The kind wth the handles that you center over the apple and push down into wedges...those just don't work well.  If the core is off center. you end up with a difficult cut and having to pare away the core from the slices.This Oxo Good Grips Corer is nice.  The trick to using this one is to twist as you push and yo get a much cleaner coring.  I used this and then slice the apples into rings...my kids love it."
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
2,"I absolutely love this corer! It's incredibly easy to use. and the best part is that it doesn't seem to have any sharp edges I can cut myself on. Clutz-approved! Despite lacking sharp edges. it still cuts through an apple very easily and without a lot of force. OXO handles are great. as I have quite a few of their other products in my kitchen. and this has lived up to it's non-slip standard. If you miss getting all the seeds out the first time. no worries! It comes out as easily as it goes in and and you can try again. Just try not to get too crazy with it. or you'll end up with a bunch of apple cylinders and no apple left!"
2,"I have several OXO Good Grips gadgets in my kitchen and I find they are consistently well designed and do the job they are meant to do and do it well. This corer is right up there with the best of the OXO tools. The handle is large and sturdy and helps me get a good grip so I can get the core out with one motion. I have really bad arthritis in my hands so if this tool did not perform well. I'd be looking for a replacement.I find this size takes out just the right amount of core. I tend to buy organic when possible and those apples are generally a little smaller than conventionally grown ones. This corer takes out just enough so the seeds and little tough seed casing is removed without taking too much of the apple flesh.Very pleased with this product and happy to recommend."
2,"Before buying this product. I used an apple corer and divider. I hated using it because I'm petite and it would take me 5 minutes of using all of my strength to core the apple and have it cut into wedges. I am starting to eat healthier and decided to buy this apple corer to see if I liked it better. I love the OXO Good Grips Corer! It takes just seconds to core the apple and the core is easy to remove from the corer. The handle is comfy and easy to grip. Cleaning the corer is also easy. I use this to core small and medium-sized apples and the core comes out completely. However. I do not think the core will come completely out with larger-sized apples because of the size of the head. Overall. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,"I followed the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated in buying this. The corer is so much better than the half circle corer I used growing up. Solid handle is easy to grip and gives you enough torque that it feels almost effortless to use. The hardest part is aiming the thing so it goes through the center of the apple. Also the size of the core extract is a little on the small side for the biggest apples. A little of the core is left in the apple. but for normal store sized apples it works great. Highly recommended!"
2,"This is an easy corer to use. You push down on the stem end and punch out the core of the apple. Peel first or not. Sometimes you get a wonky apple and the core misses a few seeds but that can be handled when you quarter the apple (a bit of trimming with the paring knife.) This is fast. I used to have one of those slice-and-core type corers but this is so much better. It's more compact in the tool drawer and it works a lot better. It's actually faster and cleaner to use the paring knife to cut the apple wedges if that's what you want.The handle is nice and grippy and thick for a good grip as you push it into the apple. and the blade is sharpe enough to easy penetrate the fruit and push out the core. I use this all the time."
2,"I bought this originally to core and fill cupcakes. This tool is great for this. You can remove the core of a cupcake and the cake will stick to the inside of the corer and easily pull out of the cupcake. Then you can use your finger to push the core out of the corer. Then fill your cupcake (with marshmallow cream. or cherry filling. so many yummy options). We also have used it to core cucumbers (and fill with herbed cream cheese). Of course coring apples is easy too. One thing I like is that while the tool isn't exceptionally sharp. with a bit of pressure it easily cores items. I like that it's not a super sharp tool. but rather serated to cut through items."
2,"I've seen different products for apples and onions that look like they do the same thing.  I needed something for both and this fits the bill.I roast and smoke apples and onions both (not together...) in the grill and in the smoker all the time.  Some of my more popular and requested items actually. so I have a need for this in more than just one way.To core your apple or onion. if it doesn't simply push straight through. all you have to do is twist it slighly back and forth while pressing down.  It cuts cleanly and doesn't take out too much either. no real waste to speak of.  For larger items you may need to go through it one more time taking out the extras but for regular or medium-large items this takes everything out in one push.Works perfectly. has a 'good grip' per the name. is very solid and cores easily.  Highly recommended kitchen gadget that will certainly get its uses around my house.-D"
2,"I use this tool every day and love it. It's very well built. simple. functional. easy to use. and only takes a few seconds to clean. What more can you ask for? It's really a time saver and makes eating apples more enjoyable because you don't have to deal with the seeds. It also cores pears.To use it all you do is line up the center of the apple. apply a little pressure while turning the handle slightly and it takes out the core with very little effort. If you love apples and pears. this is a must have tool."
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
2,"This bottle/can opener feels just like the OXO Good Grips vegetable peeler.  Its black. rubberized grip has a section of 'gills' that molds to your grip for better control.  When you're done. just pop it in the dishwasher.  The only drawback is that with long term use. the 'gills' sometimes break off.  It took years for that to happen to mine (only one section).This is hardly an elegant device. but it works well and is perfect for everyday and outdoor use.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
2,"I picked up a OXO Y-peeler. like the above model. except with a red inlay on whim in Krogers. about.. 5 to 6 years ago? I still have it and it works great! Tried to take good care of it.This peeler is perfect if you have Big hands. and want a functional peeler. and want to peel manually like nobodies business. Used to use a peeler. that wasn't a Y shape. but was just straight with a long U shaped point blade. My hand cramped up so bad all the time! And I'm a young guy. So I got this and have never looked back.I absolutely love this kitchen tool!Anyways. this will be a good investment when peeling potatoes or carrots. Haven't really used it on anything else."
2,"Switching from vertical to horizontal took a little getting used to. but I love this peeler. I had a similar one when I first married but lost it in a move or something early on. I'd thought several times I'd get another. because I did like it. but didn't get around to doing that until the old wooden vertical one finally wore out. I really like it. I especially like the little scoop on the side that lets you scoop out potato eyes while you're peeling. Nice feature. Comfortable to grip. like all OXO products."
2,"I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to &#34;Y&#34; peelers on another website. That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available. I was delighted to find OXO made one. OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle. With my other peeler. my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes. I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler. The &#34;Y&#34; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control. The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp. I'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools."
2,"does exactly what it is supposed to do. as a child i watched my grandmother use the old fashioned peeler. she could and did peel apples do the skin came off in one long  sheet. she wasn't showing off. she just had the mastery of the tool. when i needed a peeler. i automatically went with the same old fashioned peeler. i'm not sure when i finally had the chance to use one of these &#34;european&#34; peelers. they are perfect. they do exactly what a peeler is supposed to do. peel stuff quickly and easily. with emphasis on easy."
2,"I love this peeler! I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash. but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes. turnips. carrots. etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition. but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area. most stores carry only the swivel version."
2,"I got both this peeler and the OXO Pro Y Peeler. This is a very good peeler. It is much better than my old Zyliss peeler which I used to think is a great peeler compared to the nobrands I used before. HOWEVER. After using the OXO Pro series - this does not compare. I would therefore give it 4.5 if I could and not 5. (Or I should give the Pro Peeler a 6...) Bottom line - it's a good peeler. and does the job for the price. BUT - If you can spare the extra few bucks. the Pro is just a league of its own."
2,"I have a million peelers. Okay. not a million. but at least 5... and they are all terrible. I was a little skeptical to get this one. because why would this one be any different. Well. my friend brought hers over to my house when we were preparing food for a friend's party. Amazing. First of all. the grip is so comfortable! Fits my hands perfectly and doesn't hurt my hand (as much) when peeling a thousand potatoes... or carrots... or cucumbers. Second. one slice and the peel is gone! No going over the same  spot seven times! I love it so much. I went out and got my own. and those other five peelers went straight to the garbage."
2,"The handle sure is comfortable. just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber. it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip. the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid. non-damaging material."
2,"I've gone through two of these and won't purchase another.  The first one broke after using it a three or four times. but since I like Oxo products in general. I assumed it just a fluke. The second one I simply threw away. As other reviewers have pointed out. it uses tiny. metal teeth to grip the lid. which slip and could conceivably cause injury. It was worthless. so I'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a  spoon.  Works better than Oxo. that's for sure."
2,"This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower!  I was sick of using those rubber pads; not only did they tear easily. but also they didn't work very well.  So far. OXO's version has been a big improvement:  the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids. and with a simple twist. the lid is off cleanly and neatly.  I have found that the unit can sometimes slip. especially with a very small lid. but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface. you should have mostly success. as I have."
2,"Bought this six years ago to use instead of the under-cabinet one that was already installed in my kitchen. The under-cabinet one was better at unscrewing a lid. but occasionally the jar would slip out of the vice and my hand would get pinched.  Well. this OXO opener proved to be a disaster in every way. Like other reviewers noted. it doesn't secure well enough to the lid. slips off the lid. and hurts your hand when it gets slammed into the jar. I'm surprised no one has sued the company for manufacturing this awkward. uncomfortable. dangerous product."
2,"I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed.  It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble.  The opening is way too big to accomplish that so. back it went to the supermarket.  I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't. I am rating this only one star."
2,"This scoop works great. I first tried the pointed ice cream scoop and  couldn't use it. I have problems with my wrists. I have used other Oxo  tools and love them. so I tried again with this scoop. It works so well it  seems to be designed with me in mind. It is easy to dip out even the  hardest ice cream now and the bail pops the ice cream out of the scoop  --clean as a whistle. You can wash it in the dishwasher too."
2,"The metal scraper loop that expels the ice cream is unbelievably flimsy and very tenuously attached on both ends. Although it worked well as a muffin disher. it deformed and popped out the first time I tried to scoop ice cream from a batch I made that was frozen just a bit over soft serve (I would never use ANY sweeper scoop - even well-made ones like theNorpro 3-Tablespoon Stainless Steel Scoop- to dish ice cream any harder than that). Waste of money. Look elsewhere.And for dishing ice cream only. of any degree of hardness. try theZeroll Original 3-Ounce Aluminum Ice Cream Scoop."
2,"I really didn't expect much from this scoop except a fatter grip. which I need due to a hand injury. I had no great expectations - a scoop is a scoop. right? Well. not in this case. The scoop is well balanced and light weight. and easy to grip. It produces nice. even servings of ice cream instead of clunky chunks. I can get great leverage. Somehow this tool makes scooping even the hardest ice cream easier. and I never need to run it under water to soften the ice cream.  Maybe it's the pointed but not sharp leading edge of the scoop that cuts right into the ice cream. Maybe it's the leverage you get from the thick. non-slip grip. I'm just happy it makes serving ice cream effortless."
2,"I was so happy to finally find an ice cream scoop that doesn't break or bend awkwardly after only a few uses. This scoop is very sturdy with a big comfortable handle for those of us with big hands. I like the shape of the scoop itself. it's a little sharper and flatter and really does a nice job digging into the ice cream. Be careful though because this digging can lead to you puncturing the bottom or sides of the container. I would have given this 5 stars but after a month or so these little bumps began to form on the finish of the inside of the scoop. These bumps don't impact the function of the scoop. but they certainly don't look that great."
2,"My son works at a ice cream shop. and when I recieved this ice cream scoop. he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work. Until he actually used it. It looks metal. but feels like it's plastic. When I used it for the first time. I was scooping out very hard ice cream. and it felt like it was going to break. I had to turn it in circles to get anything. I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one. At least I know it won't break in my hand."
2,"I've come to expect solid. well-designed products from OXO. and this ice cream scoop did not disappoint me. From the comfortable black rubberized grip to the heavy stainless steel scooper. it's quality quality quality. I tried it on hard ice cream. and it does scoop it well...but don't expect to get by with no elbow grease. Hard ice cream is hard to scoop! The angled edges of this scoop are helpful in breaking the surface. and the narrowed/pointed end works great for getting into the corners of ice cream boxes.I like the black-and-stainless color. too. which works well with the rest of my kitchen. And. going by my usual 'what else can I use this for' approach to anything I buy. I think this would be good as a transplanting tool or. in a pinch. even a melon baller."
2,"OXO makes nice kitchen products that are reasonably priced and are of a high quality.  This ice cream scooper is another example of this and is a nice purchase.  The primary distinction between this and your average scooper is that this one has pointed edges.  This makes it easy to get the ice cream out of the box. especially when it's hard.  It also helps with getting to ice cream out of the corners.  My only con of this scooper is that due to the shape. you won't be able to get perfect round balls of ice cream.  Of course. that is a minor issue and shouldn't be a reason to avoid buying it."
2,"The good is the handle.  It is very comfortable to hold and to use.  The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff. frozen ice cream.  I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just couldn't compete.  The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand. but it was an effort to achieve results.  I wouldn't say it was any better than average.  The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch.Disclosure:  I have no connection to Tupperware"
2,"This is the worst ice cream scoop ever. The part of the scoop that attaches to the handle is only about 1/4 inch in diameter. It's a total scam; they made it look thicker. by making the part that holds the scoop 4 times as wide. You can't tell by looking at it. because they have cleverly disguised it with the plastic handle. I found out when the handle broke off in my hand. while trying to scoop some hard ice cream. Oxo. you should be ashamed of yourselves for making this piece of junk. which was clearly designed to deceive the consumer. I'll likely never buy an Oxo product again."
2,"This scoop has a comfortable handle and a good shape for attacking hard ice cream straight out of the freezer. The chrome finish is attractive and seems like it would be more durable and dishwasher-safe than the ridiculous (and unnecessary) non-stick finish I have on my other Oxo scoopOXO Good Grips 26481 Nonstick Beak Ice Cream Scoop. I prefer to dip this in water before use (so it will glide through the ice cream). and to wash it by hand afterward. This isn't an all-metal scoop. like theOXO Good Grips Solid Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop. so I'm a little concerned about its longevity."
2,"Good grips utensils have always been one of my favorites because of the large comfortable handles. I already had a good grips ice cream scoop. but got another one so I would always have one ready when i got an ice cream craving. I was surprised when this one arrived to see the shape of the scoop had been improved. now the end has a rather pointed tip. and this is GREAT! it makes scooping into hard ice cream a lot easier. This scoop puts all the others to shame. I it is now the first one I grab when i need to scoop ice cream. I also use it as a serving utensil if I am serving mashed potatoes or foods of similar consistency and it works great. You will like this scoop. there is not a better one around."
2,"My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using.  Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time.  This scoop works so much better. even without running it under hot water first!  The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material. and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me.  i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream.  Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!"
2,"It's been a month and so far. so good. with this OXO ice cream scoop.  The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold.  Also. the handle shows no sign of separating from the metal scoop part. so I'm happy about that. and the shiny finish on the scoop is smooth and blemish-free still.  We're washing it in the dishwasher. so I will update if there are any longevity issues with this ice cream scoop.All in all. if you need an ice cream scoop. this does the job nicely.*Update: February 2012*  It's been 8 months. still looks like new."
2,"This scoop has a nice edge to it that lets the scoop dig down deep no matter how hard your ice cream is.The no-slip grip on the handle is easy to grasp and not nearly as thick as some I have tried.I would of given it the full 5 stars if I could make it scoop out perfect balls of ice cream but either there is a trick to it that I haven't discovered yet or my ice cream is frozen too hard.All things considered. this is a quality item that will get lots of use in most kitchens."
2,"This is a good ice cream scoop if you're just looking for something at a reasonable price and is very comfortable.  I think those are the two biggest advantages of this utensil.  The bad thing is that it's not the most durable.  For the most durable. you'll want to look for a one piece metal scoop.  This one works best if you dip it in hot water first to heat it up and then scoop out your ice cream.  This will make the ice cream a little more easy to handle as the tool can kind of melt it's way through.  Dip it back in the hot water before each scoop.  This tip can be applied to all ice cream scoopers."
2,"I'm a long time fan of Oxo products. but this isn't one of my favorites. Based on an earlier review. I bought this to use with cookie dough as well as ice cream. The dough sticks so badly that I need to use a rubber scraper to get it out (doesn'5t matter if the dough is room temp or cold - I've tried it both ways). Furthermore. after about 6 months of use. the handle seems to not be fitting tightly with the scoop. and feels &quot;wobbly&quot;. It's also not all that easy to get clean. The lever portion is hard to get under and closes so tightly that just tossing it into the dishwasher doesn't do the job. It's going to be replaced - just don't know if it'll be replaced with another type of Oxo scoop or another brand.  I"
2,"My favorite dish brush.  When the price took a big dip I bought several.  They will last a long time too if you don't use it on hot pans and store with bristles up or not resting on anything that flattens them.  Run through the dishwasher monthly or sooner.  The large diameter handle fits my XL hand well.  If the price is around $5 - 7 jump at $10 no way?  But if ten is nothing then go for it.  I have not found anything better."
2,"I've had this dish washing utensil for about 5 months now and have put enough use in with it to give it a solid 5 star review.Unlike sponges or scour pads. this brush does not get old. the bristles stay intact and do not pull out like I've seen with other brushes and it is the perfect size for cleaning both dishes. pots and pans but at the same time being small enough to fit into glasses and mugs in order to clean the bottoms of them as well.Really glad I decided to go with this OXO good grips product based upon reviews which I had seen on Amazon.  I like this brush so much I wish I could give it as a gift to people (without the implications that they need to clean. as I've learned. cleaning devices do NOT make good gifts)!"
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
2,"I had a great little OXO brush with a suction cup that stuck to the side of the sink that finally needed replacing.  Sadly they don't seem to make that kind anymore.  So I replaced that with a longer handled brush and liked the price ($4.50 as an add on item) and the reviews.I wasn't sold on it the first use. but then I started getting more comfortable with the different style. and I like it.I would have liked the bristles a little closer together. but I figure I'll buy another round dish brush if need be.  It's great for glasses and even for scrubbing pans.  There is a soft plastic scraper tip for caked on stuff.I hand wash 75% of my dishes. so I use dish brushes a lot.  This is a good value dish brush and I am quite happy with it.  It's not worth paying $10 - $15 for a perfect brush when this is really good for a lot less."
2,"The bristles are quite firm for a brush of this type but they're spread out.  That's ok IF you use this brush to remove food from utensils prior to placing in dishwasher.If you're trying to clean pans though. this brush won't be perfect.  In that case. consider a brush just meant for that purpose such as this one:Cuisinart Round Head Brush.  Black.I recently discovered the advantage of using both kinds of brushes depending on what I'm doing.  This way. the kitchen brush isn't ruined trying to clean pans and other hard-to-clean items.  The sacrifice is having to keep two brushes handly instead of the simplicity of just one. but I found it better this way."
2,"This item just arrived yesterday. I am so happy that it did. I looked at the 'tired' dishrag being used and quickly disposed of it. My family finds the brush easier to use and 'polishes off' the dish-washing vigils with the dishcloth. Weekly bleachings of the dishcloths eventually wear the rags out. The dish brush replaces the harshness of scrubbing to remove dried or sticky foods from dishes. pots. and pans without damaging them. No more rusty or unraveling scouring pads either. Easy to clean and comfortable in the hand.This brush is sturdy and the bristles appear to be well-rooted in the base. Only time will tell! For now. I am satisfied."
2,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later. and with CONSTANT. REGULAR. FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen. the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most. thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle. not the black/white one shown in the photo. so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
2,"I had just remodeled my kitchen and got a brand new black apron style kitchen sink. Could not bear the thought of buying another $1 brush that would tear up in two week.s like the other two dozen. in the 'use for the outdoor' bin.  I thought I was splurging to by an 'expensive' kitchen brush. but good grief. this thing is still in pristine condition. There has been no problem with bristle breakage. smell. mold. handle wear. etc.  I never imagined it would hold up like it has.  So definitely worth the small investment. Save yourself the aggravation of replacing a brush constantly and go with the quality. I mainly use this for prewashing dishes before they go in the dishwasher. but also can use it on pots and pans. I've not needed to buy an extra one for any other purpose. I do agree that the bristles are widely spaced. but this has not interfered with my daily use of it."
2,"I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs.  I have only had this brush a few days. but find myself using it constantly.  It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal. cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood. and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices.  The brush can be put in the dishwasher. or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes. This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task.  It is definitely a good value for the price."
2,"I have always felt that OXO is hit and miss with quality.  I have tried several of their kitchen brushes over the years and this one is pretty good.  It has a strong handle and I suspect it will last more than 6 months.  At the same time. I'll probably replace it before then for cleanliness purposes. since the head isn't replaceable.  Regardless. it's cheap and does the trick.  Good for general cleaning of dishes. etc. but not for the true elbow grease stuff."
2,"Bought this just to get the 25 dollar free shipping. and am back for another.  This is by far the best dish and mug brush I have ever had (mind you I am not really a kitchen-y type).  Anyway. I've had it a couple months now and am impressed after using it to scrub the rings (that never come off in the dishwasher) off coffee/tea mugs. cleaning pots. etc.  Usually with other brushes the ends of the bristles get 'mashed' looking fairly quickly. but this is holding up well - even after my son cleaned mud. spider webs and other debris off an old army helmet with it - (which is why I am buying another)."
2,"I purchased this brush for the sole purpose of cleaning out my cast iron pans.  The last brush I used was from the dollar store and didn't last very long.  I like that this brush has the tips that branch out at the top. making it easier to clean around the rim of the pans.  I cook everything in cast iron nowadays. and the best way to get out tough residue it to fill the pan half way with water and bring to a slow boil.  from there the brush gets all of the tough stuff out. Then I sent the pan back on the stove for a couple of minutes under heat so the condensation evaporates.  then I spray with oil and let cool so I can store it.  Overall this is a very nice brush for the price.  I think it will last loner than the last based on it's construction."
2,"It was time for a new paring knife...  I do own quite a few.  This is the one for paring apples and most fruit. It feels like an extension of my hand when paring.  The other paring knives clean wax out of candles now.  The professional series works for me.Immediate update. I meant to post this under the 3-1/2 'professional' paring knife.  It's the same price and has a much better blade. I have owned this one and it's great for sliced a sliver of cheese out of the frig for a midnight snack.  Check out the professional one. it's only $6.99.  The 4' one is $14.99...that one I would have to think about.OXO Good Grips Professional 3-1/2-Inch Paring Knife"
2,"I suddenly had a need for more paring knives so I decided to buy four various models on Amazon to try them out.  This is by far my favorite.  They are extremely sharp and the rubberized grip is very comfortable.  When I reach into my drawer I tend to want to grab this knife over the others but have to tell myself to rotate through all of them.  I've had it for over three months now with use almost every three days and so far no sign of any type of oxidation or staining.  I wash it in a dishwasher all the time as well."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
2,"I don't have a complete knife set and was tired of ruining loaves of bread with my dull chefs knife and other basic kitchen knives.  In all honesty the main reason I purchased this particular knife was that it was the cheapest.  Having good luck with other Oxo products previously purchased. I wasn't to hesitant to purchase yet another.  It has a sharp serrated blade and a comfortable handle that have easily handled all of my bakery cutting duties (bread and bagels mostly).  This knife is also nice for heavy skinned fruits. easing through pineapples and cantaloupes.  It has also stood up to the dishwasher rather well.  You will not be sad with this knife and will be happy with the outcome of every cut you make."
2,"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.  A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs. and this knife does just that.  It has the nice 'good Grips' handle and is a good length.  It is nice and sharp and for the price. I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.  It is not the fanciest knife I own. but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.  Good. basic bread knife!"
2,"Cutting bread without a bread knife is futile exercise. This bread knife works well and is very inexpensive. The blade is only about 8 inches. so it is not quite long enough to cut bread from a bread machine if the loaf is placed on its side.  I thought I had to get a longer knife. but then I figured I can stand the bread up so that it is much narrower.  That works. the knife is now long enough to cut very thin slices of bread that has about the same thickness as the Wonder sandwich bread that I used to buy in grocery stores."
2,"We have owned a couple of bread knives.  All were serrated knives. but not all cut bread well.  The OXO (and we love that brand!) is a favorite.  The handle has a good grip... made of a harder rubber or plastic.  It is also a well balanced knife that holds comfortably in both my hand and my wife's hand.The best thing about this knife is that it cuts.  It cuts soft bread. hard bread. bagels. etc.  Like with all good bread knives. you have to let the knife do the cutting and not push down.  This one works like a champ!"
2,"I needed a good bread knife that would easily slice artisan loaves.  After reading the reviews. I purchased this one.  I like the fact that it is sharp. but I wish it was a longer length to handle wider loaves.  And I prefer a knife with more weight to it.  This one is very light weight. so at times the slices are not uniform....one side will be thinner than the other.  It's like the knife is a little hard to control.  However. it cost so little. it was worth trying."
2,"I have recently started making all my own bread and love it.  BUT - I hated cutting it!  I could never get it even and always smushed it.  I started using an electric knife and that worked better but I hate pulling it out every time I need to slice bread.  So. after some researching. I decided I needed a &#34;bread&#34; knife.  I looked at several and decided on this one due to price.  I didn't want to spend much and then it not work.  WOW!  I have used it almost every day since it arrived.  It cuts bread perfectly - straight and doesn't smush it!  I love this knife and now I don't hate cutting bread :)"
2,"I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6&quot; utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy. it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife."
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
2,"I bought a sandwich knife years ago. and loved it so much that I wanted another one. I  bought one of these knives and loved it so much that this is my second one.The rubbery substance the handle is made up gives a really secure grip and makes the knife easy to handle. The edge is serrated and will cut through most things that you'd want to cut with a sandwich knife.The blade can hold a lot of jam. mayonnaise. or cream cheese. and lay down a nice thick layer of what you're spreading. but still lets you put a thinner layer if you want.It's the easiest to use sandwich knife I've ever had."
2,"I LOVE this spreader - I bought one to try it out. despite some negative reviews.  I thought. it's only $5. I'll try it.I haven't had any of the problems that others have stated.  I don't take it apart for cleaning. and I haven't seen any rust spots.  I just throw mine in the dishwasher.After using spreaders from Pampered Chef. I much prefer the Oxo spreader. as it's much stiffer & able to scoop better.  Very useful for peanut butter. cheese spreads. cream cheese. etc.  I like it so much. I'm ordering more."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
2,"This is not a kitchen essential. but I love it.  I only bought it to take advantage of the 4 for 3 promotion. and as it turns out. I use it almost everyday.  I have had it for over a year. and it still looks like new.  I rarely use the dishwasher. so I wash mine by hand.  I probably wouldn't bother putting something like this in the dishwasher anyway.I like to bake. and I use the spreader to spread butter over the dough for cinnamon rolls. spread pizza sauce over pizza dough. and I have used it a couple of times to put the frosting on cupcakes.  What a great tool for 5 bucks!"
2,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered. as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use. peeler away from you normally.  Great control and the blade is sharp as can be. making a carrot easy work.  The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.  Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large. comfortable. and steady."
2,"I bought this set when I first moved into my apartment. as I've been a fan of the Good Grips products for a while now. This set is absolutely indespensible. as I use these tools almost every day.Peeler:  This is wonderful for peeling potatoes. as the easy-to-grip handle and swivel blade help you to comfortably maneuver around bumpy and slippery surfaces.Knife:  Since purchasing the set 4 months ago. my knife has stayed incredibly sharp and is able to cut through everything from crunchy carrots to smooshy tomatoes.Here's why the set didn't get the &quot;5&quot; rating: The pair should be hand washed and *not* put in the dishwasher.  The knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle. Note: This was easy to correct with a Brillo pad and a little elbow grease.However. I don't think you should let this &quot;diswasher drama&quot; sway you from purchasing this set. as the benefits *far* outweigh the limitations."
2,"Meat Tenderizer OXO / B00004OCJJIt always feels odd to rate minor kitchen implements as 5 stars. but this OXO meat tenderizer definitely works the way it should. The spiky end pokes holes in the meat nicely and the flat end flattens out thick chicken breasts in no time flat. It's fun to use (or at least I think so!) and it doesn't require a huge amount of strength. The grip is comfortable and doesn't lend itself to flying out of your hands. It's easy to clean - meat doesn't cling to the spiky end - and while it probably isn't rated for dishwasher use. that never stops me from throwing it in anyway. and I've had no problems.~ Ana Mardoll"
2,"I love OXO utensils and have many of them.  But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher.  Pound raw meat; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water. right?  The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum.  Now this one looks like old aluminum--it's gray and nasty looking. Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel.  It's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils."
2,"I saw all the warnings about this item not being dishwasher safe. I saw the sticker on the flat side of the mallet. Good to go. as I hand wash my dishes. After having used the thing and cleaned it right after I was done. one evening when I was tired I simply I tossed it in with the few dishes and utensils soaking in hot water. Big mistake. After that. this thing was ruined. It should have been obvious. Why would something not be dishwasher safe? The high temperatures. of course. I knew not to put it in the dishwasher. but I did not want chicken juice getting crusted on the thing and so I put it in with everything else to hand wash.Simple mistake. Cost me $15. Save yourself the trouble and try to find something that is stainless steel."
2,"I am yet another fan of OXO Good Grips products.  The meat tenderizer is another good product.  It is very ergonomic. and it's heavy/solid so that you don't have to pound as hard as you would with more lightweight tenderizers.I don't like the fact that you can't put it in the dishwasher. but really. scrub it with some anti-bacterial dish soap and you're all set.  After shopping at several home product stores in search of a tenderizer. I came back to the OXO Good Grips because I found it the best. in spite of not being able to put it in the dishwasher."
2,"My last masher (from a respected and pricey brand name) couldn't take the pressure-literally!  One day I'm just mashing up a batch of potatoes and *snap&#34; it's time for the trash bin.  That's why I bought this masher from OXO.This one is a solid. heavy-gauge steel wire that goes all the way up into the sturdy handle.  I'm not sure I could break it if I tried!  Works great at mashing (just as good as one with square or circle holes). and the large grip makes it easy to hold even if you get a little butter on your hands (trust me. I have done it)."
2,"Sturdy metal potato smasher. which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.  We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef. ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat.  It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network. and once I learned this trick. it really made that step in cooking so much easier.  Also. we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.  Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat.  It just makes sense."
2,"For my husbands and I's first Christmas I asked for a potato masher. He got this exact one and I can say that I've used it once a week for 10 years and its still perfect. The handle is just fine and it never rusted or anything. I love all the Oxo products. they really do last years and years. I've bought other companies products for the kitchen and they fall apart. is I specifically look for Oxo Good Grips whenever I go get a kitchen gadget because I know it will last for years. One tip. after you mash the potatoes rinse off the potato from the masher because once that potato dries it takes alot of work to remove."
2,"This is a great. old-fashioned style of potato masher. which produces the type of mashed potatoes I remember from my childhood. What it has. though. that ones from many years ago did not is the OXO ergonometric design. with a comfortable handle. It also contains a hole at the top of the handle for hanging on a rack.This is excellent not only for potatoes. but for apples. carrots. various kinds of squash. turnips and other soft-cooked fruits and vegetables.The masher is made of durable stainless steel that helps you avoid rust."
2,"I purchased Several OXO Good Grips including a Lemon/Lime Reamer. Cheese Plane. Wire Potato Masher and Box Grader.  They were all reasonably priced and are made of good quality material.  The potato masher is the best that I have ever used and I use it for everything.  I like to mix bell pepper and onions in ground beef instead of using a large spoon.  Add a can of black olives in the mix and mash them up also.  I would recommend this brand.  The handle has a nice grip and is nice and soft.  I considered this brand because I have the wire whisks and other products by OXO."
2,"I made the pefect lumpy potatoes with this.  Sounds odd. but that's what I wanted.  I have a ricer. but I wanted the mashed potatoes from my childhood.  I went out and bought this specifically for the task.  I have no regrets or complaints.  The handle felt fine. better than what my mother used to have.  I remember hers having more mashing surface. but that may be because I was young.  This one seems compact. so it works fine for a small amount of potatoes in a smaller bowl (perfect for me.)If you want ultra smooth. this isn't the product for you.  Get the Oxo ricer."
2,"So far I have to say that this is the best masher I've ever had. and at 65. I have had or used any number of them.  The &#34;wire&#34; portion is solid. sturdy and will never bend.  The handle is long. has an adequate circumference and is padded. making it easy to grip and at the same time. comfortable.  To top it all off. the end of the handle has extra padding on it so when you bear down it doesn't feel uncomfortable.  Great product and worth the price!"
2,"Bought this to replace a similar one I'd had for many many years.  I really liked the old one. but had repaired the handle many times & it was now beyond repair.  Wish I'd bought this one sooner!  The soft grip is wonderful. & the ridges on the working surface make it glide thru the cheese much easier; no more bogging down. no more  bunched up cheese slices.  Just a nice. wafer thin piece of cheese that does not stick to the plane when you try to take it off."
2,"My husband doesn't mind this. but I hate it and won't use it.  I will grab the pairing knife if our traditional stringed cheese cutter is dirty. before grabbing this.  It is too flimsy in my opinion (surprising really for Oxo). to do its job. and it very difficult to get to the end of your cut without removing a whole CHUNK of cheese from the end.  I guess the other reviewers are right - you are either one who loves cheese planes. or you don't :(."
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
2,"Heavy. smooth action. sharp.  My husband makes an ultra-deep-dish 'priazzo' about 2 inches deep. and this cuts right through - extra pepperoni. extra veggies. extra cheese. extra thick crust. it can handle it all!  Plus. it feels good in your hand.  Nice piece of equipment.Update 7/3/12: I suddenly realized a couple of weeks ago that this wheel wasn't working as well as it used to. so I decided to sharpen it for the first time. It was a little tricky to run through my Chef's Mate. but it's working a little better now. I'm thinking I'll need to replace it in a year or so. Still. it was used about once a week for about 4.5 years; if I get another year out of it. that's not too shabby!"
2,"OXO makes great products at a great price.  It is that simple.  I am sure there are better products out there at four or six times the price. but OXO makes the best stuff at the best price - it is that simple.This pizza wheel is excellent.  I have read other reviews where people moan about how large it is.  These people are idiots.  First of all. it says before you buy it how large it is. so these people are either too stupid to read or too lazy to read.Second of all. one of the reasons why I bought this is because it is large. and the weight makes it easier to cut through pizza.Some people who reviewed this said it was not sharp when they got this.  I admit this might be a pain to sharpen if it was dull. but mine is sharp so no problems there.A great product."
2,"I don't know what I expected but this pizza wheel is large! But it is also the best we've owned in the past 25 years. It rolls easily and with the sharpness of the wheels blade it'll cut through just about any kind of pizza you want it to.The grip (like on all of the OXO Good Grip items) is excellent. and it is made to last. High quality construction. great blade. and grate grip. and great price. What else can I say.I would recommend it to anyone."
2,"I have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult.  This has great grip. great balance (it looks like it should be off but it's not).  Super cutting edge - one pass cuts even thin crispy crusts - which my old cutter took several passes to accomplish.  It's heavy but really well balanced so I think that combination might be what helps it to cut so well.Would buy it again & highly recommend it.Note - it is big - think they said 4'.  Most pizza wheels that I've seen are much smaller.  I had to find a new storage space for it but totally worth it."
2,"I finally broke down and got one of these after getting fed up at dragging my knuckles through the pizza with my old. small wheel cutter. Boy am I glad I did! This cutter works sooo much better. I don't know if it's sharper. or if it's because it has more heft. but it cuts right through those pizza crusts. like a charm.  I have also used it to cut pastry and dough and it works really well at that. too. Finally. it cleans up quickly easily. Definitely a great gadget every kitchen should have."
2,"This pizza wheel is so much bigger and nicer than the little $2 pizza cutter I had that I uploaded a picture for comparison.  First of all. it's huge and makes quick work of even your deepest deep dish pizza.  You hardly have to apply any force at all.  It has a very nice weight and quality feel to it.  I hand wash and dry this so that it will last a really long time.I have been adding Oxo kitchen tools to my arsenal over time. and it has become one of my favorite brands along with KitchenAid. Cuisinart. Calphalon. etc.If you are willing to pay $12 for a pizza cutter you won't be disappointed with this one.  It may be the last one you buy."
2,"Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss. and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement.  I landed on this one!  And then it came in the mail.  Great quality. expect it will last five times longer than our first (somewhat cheap) one did.  BUT.  This thing is giant!  Do you know how big four inches is?  I may just be really dumb but I've never seen a pizza cutter this big for home use.  It looks like something you'd use in home defense.  Who needs a pot when you've got a gigantic sharp round blade to swing? Seriously. I didn't know I'd have to lock it away from the children. but I really don't think it's safe to leave in reach of even our oldest.  It works great. though.  I guess it's for serious pizza eaters."
2,"when given the choice. i always buy oxo. it's the most comfortable for my hands. this pizza wheel is great. sharp. and cuts clean. and i found it for a steal at ross dress for less at $3.99!!!!!! would i buy it at amazon for the inflated price? uh. no. even if i didn't find it at $3.99. i would have bought it at bed. bath. and beyond for cheaper with their 20% off coupons. amazon. if you want to stay competitive. price your items lower!"
2,"A pizza cutter isn't something you think about all that often until you need one. Well. I did. Not only does Pizza Hut never cut my pizzas all the way through. but frozen ones don't come with any slice cuts at all. So you gotta have one of these. My old one must have been about as sharp as a spoon because it took many. many rolls across the pizza surface to make a cut. Missed a lot and created too many super narrow slices. This little guy does it perfectly in one pass. so I'm a fool for having waited so long to buy one."
2,"This is my second pizza cutter in my entire life. It is everything I thought it would be and more. I love the grippy handle and the huge wheel. I use it on my home made pizza. Yes. I make the dough from scratch along with everything else. It cuts my dough to perfectlion. I don't buy pizza from the store or from chains. so I don't know how it would work on other pizzas. I think that if it was used on store-bought pizza it might be comparable to cutting through a cardboard box. That is not what this item is designed to do. Use a box cutter for that. Overall it is highly recommended by me. Keep in mind that I also make whole wheat dough and like it extra crispy. It does beautiful job."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
2,"This must be the worst product I've ever purchased that sports the OXO label. And I've got a lot of the stuff. and have been generally satisfied with it. I needed a channel knife. wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife (instead of pulling it long-ways towards you--look at other channel knives. you'll know what I mean). This gadget cuts the raggediest. least-attractive lemon twists ever. and it's hard to pull through the rind as well. So I thought OK. it's still a good zester. And.....No-it's-not. Get a microplane. or maybe a different zester. but this one is a turd. Finally. the handle is not 'comfortable.' it's too hard and too big for my (fairly small but not outrageously so) hand. The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy."
2,"I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 for any of you who care). I have only about 1/3 use of my hands and about 1/2 use of my arms. but I can use this zester--not with great ease. but I can use it!  I cannot use any other  zester I have tried.My mother has mild arthritis and she likes my Oxo  tools better than her own (even the ones she's grown to love over the  years).The zesting blades are sharp and at the perfect angle.  You get  perfect zest with little effort.  And you get NO pith (bitter white  part).As with almost all Oxo tools the design is excellent: it is highly  ergonomic--it fits the hand and works the way it should."
2,"Most kitchens probably do not have a lemon zester as a routine item. but the OXO zester is a must for both casual and professional cooks. The problem with most zesters is they aren't sharp enough to properly zest only  the lemon peel but instead give you white pith along with the zest. But the  OXO only gives you the best of the lemon as it stainless steel blade cuts  sharply and cleanly. Another excellent feature is a built in garnishing  tool that allows you to cut designs into citrus fruit thus giving you two  kitchen gadgets for the price of one. The zester is quite durable and goes  through the dishwasher quite well too. This tool is also extremely safe for  even the youngest of hands as its slip proof construction allows you to  grip it easily without fear of slipping and hurting oneself. So add some  zest the OXO way!"
2,"I don't know if other zesters would be better. as I have not used any prior to purchasing this one.If this is going to be your first zester. I recommend this one. This is my first and I appreciate the price and quality. It makes the job very easy and the size of the zest depends on how big your strokes are. You can make them pretty small too.Other reviews make a good point emphasizing that it does miss some spots. I feel like it's a very minor thing though and many zester will miss pieces too. but don't get this product if you are aiming to get 100% of the zest. It's not a big deal for me personally though as I feel like it misses less than 10% so I can always get another fruit out.MAIN POINTS: Easy to use. easy to clean. great zest of varied size. but does miss some zest. Overall. a great product."
2,"Before purchasing this nifty little zester. I would always leave the zest out of any recipe that called for it.  Whenever I tried to use a grater. the colored zest would stick inside the holes.  If I kept on grating until the zest came out the other side. then I'd also get bits of bitter pith that would ruin the taste and the recipe.This tool makes perfect zest that includes only the flavorful colored part of the citrus peel.  You run it lightly over the surface of the peel. and it makes ultra-thin strips of colored zest.  The tool is easy to control. and a snap to use.  I use mine to make non-bitter-tasting orange. lemon. and lime zests for homemade sorbets. ices. and ice creams."
2,"Every chef says the best mashed potatoes are made with a ricer so I treated myself to this one.  I found the handles a little uncomfortable...silicone or rubber on them might help.  Pressing the potato through isn't as easy as chefs make it look but I found if I put the bowl in the sink and then leaned the lower handle on the sink and pressed down. it was much easier and kind of fun.The potatoes came through very fluffy but really once you add the milk and butter. they become creamy so I don't know about this 'fluffy mashed potatoes' I keep reading about.  But using the ricer is much more consistent than mashing...not a chance of lumps so they're very very smooth.  I'd definitely recommend this product."
2,"I had my doubts about this item because it felt a little flimsy when I removed it from the box. It's lightweight and the handles seemed a little small. However. it worked flawlessly and made super-smooth mashed potatoes. It's very easy to press the potatoes through the holes.The only downside is that it takes a little time because you can't fit a whole potato in the ricer. you need to cut the potato into workable chunks. and it's a little bit messy. But the consistent smoothness is well worth it. I liked this much. much better than a standard masher.A couple of tips: make sure you use soft enough potatoes (I used russets) and place the potato so that the peel faces the top. not the holes. You also must remove the peel each time you press (that's where the messy part comes in.)Recommended!"
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"I honestly only use this ricer on potatoes. and only after my 'food mill' has done all the work. yet has left me with a few hard scraps that won't pass through the blade.  I place the scraps into the ricer and voila. no wasted potatoes.I was watching Chef Michael Chiarello on the Food Network and this is the exact model he uses on his mashed potatoes. It's construction is solid and smooth.I myself do not make spaetzle. so I cannot comment on its uses for making that dish; however. for making potatoes. when combined with the food mill. it serves a purpose for me. If I could only afford one tool for mashed potatoes. I'd opt for the 'food mill'."
2,"This tool is a must-have for preparing mashed potatoes. It takes all of the effort and lumps out of making perfect mashed potatoes.A little bit of potatoes can squeeze out from the top of the lid as you push it down (which is why I only gave 4 stars) but since the gap is so narrow. what squeezes out is also 'mashed' so it can be thrown in with the rest of the potatoes.My girlfriend complained that it is a little hard to squeeze when packed to the rim with potatoes. but this can be controlled by putting less potatoes in it each time.Overall an excellent product. Very easy to clean."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
2,"I find it hard to imagine how I've done without a potato ricer all my life!  The Oxo potato ricer is a great size for one to two people (though it would also work well for a larger crowd on special occasions. it would just take a little longer) and is well constructed. I found six medium potatoes made a nice bowl of mashed potatoes for two. I didn't mind not having the interchangeable disks. the size of the holes on this ricer were just the perfect size to make nice. fluffy Yukon Gold potatoes. I even threw two cloves of garlic into the pot with the potatoes. then riced them along with the potatoes for a very tasty bowl of garlic potatoes. I'm seriously impressed with the Oxo potato ricer and highly recommend it!"
2,"Great little kitchen gadget. Simple. well made and should last a lifetime when used properly. My wife is really happy with the contraption. it makes it a lot quicker when making cakes. pies etc to rice the fruits than cutting. squashing. smashing etc just insert and out it comes all uniformly so that it can be easily folded into your mixes.Originally was purchased because she wanted to make her own hash-browns... Been over two weeks... Still waiting on them.I have learned that whenever the wife wants a kitchen gadget to always search Amazon first. The heck with going to stores. calling around or asking. IF you can't find it here. you probably cannot find it in a store. It is usually MUCH cheaper to order online than driving around searching or waiting for hours for someone that has no clue what the item is or IF they even have it."
2,"It's a ricer. there isn't a lot of magic going on here to report on.  It's basically a large garlic press that you can use to make smooth mashed potatoes. assuming you don't know what a ricer is.The quality of construction is good. the ease of use is good. and the price is good.  I wish there was more to talk about. but the device is just too simple to get really in depth.One down side would be the ricer could be a tad bigger so you can rice more potato at a time. but its not bad.I would buy this again."
2,"Because my daughter is a HUGE fan of mashed potatoes I finally broke down and got a ricer for perfect potatoes every time.  I LOVE this item.1)I boil my potatoes with the skins on until they are very tender.2)I rice them one at a time WITHOUT removing the skins. The flesh drops into the bowl of butter and cream below while the skins stay behind in the ricer (and typically stick to the plunger. so I simply nudge them off into the garbage between potatoes.)3)I toss the ricer in the open position into my dishwasher and forget it!4)I give the potatoes a quick stir and voila!  Rich. creamy. smooth mashed potatoes with no peeling. dicing. or beating with a cumbersome electric mixer.Maybe ALL ricers perform this well. but honestly. this item is the best.  I am so happy with this purchase."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
2,"OXO designs great products and this is no exception.  It does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top.  I just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease.  I liked it so much. I bought one for my aunt.Before this. I made mashed potatoes with a masher; the difference is unbelievable.  I kept my masher because I'm a Southern girl and sometimes I want lumpy mashed potatoes.This is easy to clean -- throw it in the dishwasher."
2,"I first bought this to squeeze out the juice from potatoes when making hash browns but its first use was actually making mashed potatoes.  For that purpose it works great. mashed potatoes are very fluffy using this and it is very easy to use.  My kids love watching me make it and like using it themselves.  The plate that mashes down on the potatoes is not a very tight seal so you will have some small amount of potatoes that squeeze through the top part. but it's OK. I just throw those in with the mashed potatoes as well because they come out mashed.  It is pretty easy to clean as well. I just use a strong stream of water into the &#34;cup&#34; and then the other way from outside through the small holes.  Then I do a quick wash with dishwashing detergent.  Definitely glad I bought this!"
2,"I have heard for quite some time how wonderful Potato Ricers are. They process the Potato in one squeeze. and prevent over mixing and creating glue when using a stand mixer. I decided to see for myself if I preferred riced potatoes. The first time I used the OXO Ricer. the Potatoes came out creamy and delicious. The texture was different than whipped Potatoes. and the flavor was more &#34;natural&#34;. I didn't need to stir in as much butter or cream as I usually would when I used the stand mixer. I now use the Ricer every time I make Mashed Potatoes. and really enjoy this new method. The OXO Ricer is easy to use. easy to clean. and the padded grips prevent hand cramping if you are processing a larger batch. - Highly recommended."
2,"Prior to recently I did not have much experience with potato ricers but when reading about different gnocchi techniques they were regularly mentioned as providing smooth and even potatoes and other vegetables of the like.  I was a bit hesitant to purchase something that seemingly accomplished one task...mashing. which is something I have been able to do with a masher or a mixer.  Regardless I took the plunge and I must say it has been a worthwhile purchase.This ricer produces consistently smooth potatoes.  I have also used it with sweet potatoes. acorn squash. squeezing liquid from spinach and grated jalapeno and to juice lemons.  It has done all of these effortlessly and consistently.I find myself using it at least once a week while preparing dinner. often times just to make mashed potatoes for one.  It allows me to make what was once a relatively involved side dish in under two minutes of active kitchen work.I plan on gifting a few of these in the coming months."
2,"I was helping my niece set up her new home and we were trying to buy a lot of things for not that much money.  I think it's so important to have good knives - but when I went looking - the really good ones were SO much money.  I decided to try this pair because of the name - OXO - I have loved every one of the products I have purchased from them - and the price.  Well. I was so impressed. I had to buy a set for myself as well.  These are the knives I reach for everyday.  My expensive set of knives are on my counter. but the convenience. comfortable feel and the good job that the OXO knives do - they are the ones I use most often.  At this price. I can't imagine any home without them!"
2,"A very nice set - the only complaint I would have would be not so much a complaint but an observation that the cracker is seemingly designed for larger shells.  It is not as effective for smaller pieces unless you place them and attempt to hold them in place right in the middle of the unit where the two pads come together and actually make contact.  It is very heavy duty and comfortable though and does just fine.  The only modification I'd recommend to OXO would be to design the cracker to come closer together at the hinged end.  I'd still get it again though if anything happened to it."
2,"We have two and have given 2-3 as gifts. Everyone loves them. They are solid and sturdy. Just the right weight. So far. no rusting or chipping. They feel good and are easy to use.The crackers work much better than the ones we've had for 30 years (and which probably cost 99 cents at the time). There is no wobble in the hinge and the large middle cracking area is perfect for just cracking crab and lobster legs without crushing them.The picks are well made. The forked design works much better than the curved single-tine picks and the spoon scoop end easily finishes the job.This set is expensive. Many sets are available for half or less. That's the reason for only 4 stars. I have not compared the quality of the cheaper sets. so maybe these are really worth the extra. I'm glad we have them."
2,"I have used a P38 for over 40 years; I find it to be light weight and ready to use at a moment's notice.However the Oxo good grips will hold the can in place while opening the lid. Not being on the chain. you can also open it with your arms extended; this comes in handy when you are opening cat food.  This also does not require you to be so dexterous.  Your finger does not become calloused.  And it does not get lost in the dishwasher.Just be sure while the cat is sniffing the can. that you don't grind his whiskers.GI - P- 38 - Can Opener"
2,"We got rid of the automatic can opener because we wanted one that could easily be cleaned after each use.  We do not put the Oxo Good Grips into the dishwasher. but we do rinse it after each use.  After a few years use. even tho the blade itself has no rust. the recessed screw area and portions of the handle has rusted badly.  You'd think that it would not be that costly to use stainless screws. washer. and nuts. and it would certainly improve the quality greatly.  It works easily and smoothly enough. even though it is a little bulky for smaller hands and in the drawer.  We thought that by purchasing one of the more expensive brands. it would not rust. so that part is disappointing."
2,"When I was a kid. my parents went through more electric can openers than I care to count; high complexity. dubious reliability.  The run-of-the-mill manual openers weren't much better; they would usually slip. failing to turn the can and open it.Enter the GoodGrips can opener - I picked one of these up over a year ago. and it's functioned perfectly ever since.  The all-stainless construction means no fear of dishwashers. though you'll want to keep metal utensils from banging into the blade.  The rubber handles are very comfortable. and the big fat plastic crank handle handily rotates the can with no contortions whatsoever.  Simple and inexpensive but effective - I've been very satisfied with this product.In fact. it was so good I gave one to my mother. and she hasn't complained about it a bit!"
2,"I bought 3 of the Oxo Good Grips can openers.  We kept two and gave my son one.  The first one died within a month when the black plastic tip broke.  We used the second one and again the black tip broke leaving it useless.  When I warned my son about the black plastic tip he told me that a chip broke in his but it still works.We are now using a cheap $1.99 pair we bought from Walmart. At least it opens a can. that is more than I can say about Oxo.OXO Good Grips Can Opener"
2,"I have owned this can opener for 3 years now and I am still mostly happy with it. It features comfortable rubber grip handles and an ergonomicle hand crank (my favorite part). Due to the design. I notice less stress and strain on my hands and wrists using this product than I had with cheaper models. I have not noticed any rusting or other problems as far as functionality is concerned. The rubber handles have loosened a bit and slide down occassionally. but this has not been problematic as of yet. All and all it has been a good product and if I ever needed a new one. I would be willing to buy this same model again."
2,"OXO Soft-Handled Can Opener. Item # 28081. This is a hard-to-clean kitchen tool. Not all the metal parts are stainless so they get pitted and retain food particles. Also. the soft handles are not sealed onto the body of the can opener. so dishwater accumulates in them. and therefore so do rotting food particles. mold... you get the point. It is possible to pull off the handles and wash all the surfaces. but what a pain! And then. the handles wear and loosen so they start to slide when opening cans. After three months. I replaced the Oxo Good Grips Can Opener with aZyliss Lock-n-Lift Can Openerwhich. after six months. still works very well."
2,"I have a philosophy that will not allow me to buy crummy tools. Tools for anything.... if they do not work or do not last. they are worthless. That's why I paid 14 bucks for a hand-operated can opener. Being an engineer I looked at the design and was impressed by the symmetrical (rather than cantilevered) hinge. I reasoned that this would make the opener sturdy and allow it to work as intended for a long time. IT DID NOT. This overpriced piece of trash DOES NOT open cans. There may be other uses for it but opening cans is not one of them. That's why I'm on Amazon today. I am throwing this junk out and buying 6 of the 2 dollar can openers. That should last me my lifetime and leave 1 or 2 to bequeath to my survivors. Yes it is making me depart from my lifelong philosophy (and that makes me mad) but it is in self-defense. I am hungry and I CAN NOT OPEN ANY CANS."
2,"I've had them all!  Wood. Plastic and Aluminum and I prefer the Aluminum type.Even though the wood works a little bit better. it's harder to clean and after a while it starts to look gunky and unhealthy.  Hard to wash the wood after it's been used a while and the wood is no longer smooth.  No matter how hard you wash. it still feels slimy and that's what bothers me.You may have to work a bit harder with the plastic or aluminum but when you wash them. they're clean and they feel clean."
2,"The Good:  These tongs are cheap and adequate.  I needed a long pair of tongs with metal ends to work in the grill and hot pans and this this did the trick.  They open and close with ease. just like the smaller versions you can buy.  Additionally. arms of the tongs are well made.The Bad:  The ends of these tongs are very thin and mine came twisted a slight bit.  It all gave the impression of being slightly cheaply made. but for $15 you get what you pay for."
2,"...the spring rusts. I own both the 12' (for normal indoor cooking) and the 16' (for grilling). I have used both countless times. They grip food well and you feel as though you have a firm hold of the hood too. In all the times I have used them. I have discovered two main flaws. The first flaw is the flexibility (bend-ibility)of the 'hands'. the part of the tongs that actually touches the food. If you grasp the food too tight. they bend. This means the they will not close tight without bending them back into shape. The second is the metal used in the spring. This metal is prone to rust and when it rusts the tongs no longer have their normal spring and often get stuck. My advice would be to spend a little more money and get a hight quality."
2,"Searched high and low for the perfect tongs for non-stick surfaces that didn't cost a fortune and of course found the OXO brand to perfectly fit the bill (as usual).  These are not too long. perfect for kitchen use.  Their tips are not the annoying soft silicone type like so many out there but instead a harder tip that is angled and pointed so you can use then for a number of surfaces or into pots of boiling things.  I really love the feel of these in my smallish hands and that they lock is an added bonus so they don't take up tons of room in your drawer.  Perfect!"
2,"I bought the 12&#34; size 6 years ago and they are still serving me well. I just bought the 16&#34; & 9&#34; sizes for almost $30 and if they are as good as the older 12&#34; ones. I'm OK with spending that coin. They are easy to clean. do not rust. and the locking mechanism is super nice! Cheap tongs with that cheesy metal slide annoy me to no end as they enviably slide down and lock the tongs when I need to pick something up. Spontaneous locking is not a problem with these."
2,"I have had these for a couple years. and I think I use them almost every day. The locking feature is really handy. and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands. The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy. cool grip.I have one minor complaint. the tongs don't work well with delicate things. For example. with chicken parmesan. the breading rips right off. Now. we'll eat anything. so it isn't a big deal to us. I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods."

1,"I would recommend this for a travel magnifier for the occasional reading.I had read on another review about a magnifier having a problem with the light coming on. I did find that this one appeared to be DOA out of the box. But. after opening & shutting the viewer to turn on & off the light. the light began to come on. After several times of doing this. the light appears to be coming on all the time.It is small. but for taking it someplace & reading things like a menu in a dark corner of a restaurant. this is great."
1,"These are lightweight and efficient and have some very good points:- the batteries last 2-3 months with daily use.- the LED is bright enough and adequately covers the whole magnified area under the 3X lens-- the lens itself is glass and good quality- the shell is plastic and it&#8217;s very light (but may not take a beating over time)-  it&#8217;s easy to open and turn on the light and the sliding mechanism has never failedI bought a six-pack of these from another vendor and all I can say is to shop around because prices vary tremendously.  I use this magnifier to inspect seeds and leaves.  I keep these magnifiers on my desk. in my briefcase. and in a backpack and I like them a lot."
1,"Seems to be a legit 3X.  I bought my first and everything perfect.  So I bought a 2nd for my nephew - but that one had the light issue someone else mentioned (really dim. flickering).  Before I sent it back. I wanted to check the batteries - so I unscrewed where they are. took them out. but it looked like the contact on the right battery on the unit(uses 2 small watch-like ones) had some kind of grime on it - wiped that off. and I also bent the little tab to stick out a little more to give it a better contact on the battery - did that for the other side as well (it's different because of the +/- but you can bend both sides out a little).  After that. put the batteries back in and it works like my good one."
1,"I'll admit it.  I fought like crazy when people started suggesting that I get a magnifying glass.  Yes. I could no longer some menu descriptions. especially in low light.  And when I needed to see the model number on an electronic device's sticker. and couldn't. well. that was a problem too.  After I accepted that I had a problem. I refused to get an old-fashioned magnifier. like my mother uses.  So. I looked around and this caught my eye (haha). I've been using it for a few weeks now and I love it.  It is black and sleek. and. yes gets the job done.  And. those low light environments?  No longer a problem. since this has a built in light that turns on when you slide open the magnifier."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
1,"This is a great little portable magnifier with light.  I bought 2 of them so I could keep one in my purse and have one for my desk.  However. my husband liked the blue one so much he took off with one and now I need to re-order!It is slightly curved so it feels good in your grip.  Closed. it measures about as long as your standard full-sized desktop mouse and about a half inch thick.  The viewing glass area is about as big as the face/screen of a flip style cell phone.  When open it emits an impressively strong light that works like a champ in the darkest of rooms. As it is an LED light it should have a very long operating life as LEDs don't require a lot of power.  Presumably the battery could be changed if needed as there is a small door with a single screw located behind where the light is housed.  5 stars!"
1,"This magnifier has nothing to cover it when not in use.I compared it with a Carson 3x magnifier and this one did not seem as clear as the Carson - hard to see the furigana clearly in Japanese comic books with this one.The Carson ones come with a cover.I would recommend the Carson 5x if you are looking for good size enlarging.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out MagnifierI wish I had skipped the 3x and gone with the 5x only.For this one in the 3x. the light works well and lights things up nicely.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out Magnifier"
1,"purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier. this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu. for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page."
1,"This magnifier is convenient. in that it is in a container. so it prevents scratches on the glass. but it's a lot bulkier than I expected it to be. Also. you have to move the angle of the glass around or the lettering looks distorted at times. and I don't like the 6x magnifier at the bottom right corner of the lens - it's distracting. The LED light comes in extremely handy in the dark. and is nice and bright. but only on the side of the glass that the light is located. It does it's job. i guess. but not what I expected."
1,"I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times. that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients. etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money."
1,"Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However. I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling. even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass. but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes."

1,"ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging. but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale. Lights powered by them are semi-bright. and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier. MyBatterySupplier. I ordered the50-pack. which did come in the new hologram package. and the difference was dramatic.  Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant. and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars."
1,"This is a great price for batteries. you could pay a couple of bucks a retail store for only 1 or 2 when you can get 10 on Amazon!  These little LR44's are found in so many of my children's toys. the Thomas the Tank Engine cars that talk. Tinkerbell that glows. Christmas ornaments. even some little cheap twirling lights bought at the dollar store.  I have ordered these twice now. because something new dies and I find that it needs the same kind of battery.  It's definitely more economical to buy in this quantity than buying a couple at a time!  They also work well and last. too.  Stock up HERE!!"
1,"Bought 3 packs. prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $3 each. but they are easy to check in the card and all were good.  Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I hadn't reviewed them.  Very pleased.BTW. it is true that the description is misleading. the batteries I received are alkaline. not silver-oxide.  I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices. but for toys and flashlights. alkaline is a better value."
1,"I've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera. I've had the same problem: I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later. I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day. having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries. I'd had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin. and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them."
1,"In this day and age it is hard to understand why everyone isn't using rechargable batteries.  I own about 6 packs of these batteries.  They are wonderful.  I bet I have saved hundreds of dollars so far and keep saving.  Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times.  I absolutely refuse to by disposable batteries for the most part.  It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal energizer alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power.  For example Digital Camera's take a lot of power.  But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now.  I highly recommend them to everyone."
1,"I use my rechargable batteries for just about everything. Be it remote controls. cameras.and flashlights and I haven't noticed any rapid deteriorating of the batteries. Recharging takes about 12 hrs but I keep extra just in case. The only issue I have had is the price - it keeps going up. I've seen them priced as high as $12 for the 4 pack. I have also seen them as low as $7.99 at Menards they average about $9.99. If you decide to use rechargable batteries just make sure you have extra ones for when they run down."
1,"I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use. they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not 'Great for the environment' if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :("
1,"I have mixed feelings about these batteries.  They take a good charge and hold it better than my Duracell rechargebles. but still lose about 10% overnight.  I use them to power a one-LED night light outdoors.  It keeps it bright for at least three nights if I remember to turn it off during the day.  One of the four batteries is a little loosey-goosey.  Sometimes it only charges about 75%. though another recharge cycle will restore it to full again.  Considering other reviewers' comments about funky batteries. maybe they should tighten their quality control."
1,"I have 4 kids and we were using batteries like crazy.  I don't necessarily like throwing all of those batteries away when there are rechargables.  I went to the store without doing any research first and just picked up these Energizers 2500mAhs.  Needless to say. most don't work after a year.  I couldn't get my programmable thermastat to even work because it had such a low charge coming straight off of the charger.  And today. my sons batteries died in his guitar. took the ones that had just gotten done in the charger and they didn't even last five minutes. and boy he wasn't very happy.  I think I would have been better off getting those junky ones from the dollar store.  Look for a better brand!"
1,"I originally got this for my daughter's leapfrog leap pad. She was going through batteries every couple of days. so rather than go broke buying batteries. I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries. 4 Batteries Included. which gives us a set to put in her leap pad. and a set to keep on the charger charged.  It charges well. and is always ready when I need to swap them out. It is definite woth the money. especially if you go through a lot of batteries."
1,"I was going through quite a few batteries for my cats' toys: there's a chase-the-string toy. a chase-the-mouse-tail toy. and a whoo-hoo!-chase-the-laser dot toy.  Using the rechargeable batteries works well - I have an Energizer charger and two sets of 4 AAs to rotate. so they've always got something ready to pounce on!  I'm saving money and not throwing away so many batteries. and the cats don't notice the difference!"
1,"While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands. I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.  I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience. as it depends what you use them for. but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use.  They're nearly worthless to me.  I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year. so hopefully those will work as promised.  I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these.  Try another brand."
1,"I'm a die hard geocacher - and the best AA batteries I can find for long life are the Energizer Lithium 9x batteries. but they are expensive and it bothers me to dispose of so many batteries (even recycled) in a year.  SO. I bought two sets of these and a charger and they work well.  Not great. but well.  I have to change batters in the outdoor GPS twice for a full day of caching whereas I could go all day on the Lithium 9x ones.  Sort of an inconvenience. but going green on anything seems to have it's convenience price tag...Good batteries.  Have the Rayovac rechargeable AA's as well and these seem to be a LITTLE longer lasting on a full charge."
1,"I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it's completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn't pump water anymore. I wouldn't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out. the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they'll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt. Overall I'd rate this unit as 'build quality: poor. life span: short. effectiveness: disappointing'."
1,"Duracell 9 volts are the only batteries I use in the wireless microphones we use for our instructional video business. We replace the batteries before every shoot and sometime run for up to 10 hours non-stop. Wireless microphones use a lot of power and we have found that the Duracell batteries can make it through an entire day of shooting. lasting about 25% longer than the less expensive generic types we tried before.We also use Duracell 9 volts in our smoke detectors at home. They might be more expensive than some. but they are worth it in the long run.Highly recommended!"
1,"Although I'm sure my local fire department will cringe if they read this. I buy these things for our backups for our fire alarms and they last over 4 years!  Wow!  Now if I buy a knockoff brand. or even Energizer. I can only get 18 months out of them before they start squealing to be replaced.  Plus. this 8 battery pack makes it awfully simple to have them around when it comes time to change them. and it's the right number for my house.  Love these Duracells!  Highly. highly recommend!"
1,"You want a battery that is going to last. then you can't go wrong with this one. I bought the 8 count because my garbage can needs 4 and the shelf life of these batteries is so good that I have no doubt it will provide me with the many months of use. Since I have the first 4 still being used. going on 7 months now. I am going to guess at least 1 year before I will need to replace so yes. a good purchase price for this 8 pack."
1,"For most people. that's what you will need these for.  And once that stupid thing starts beeping at 3 AM (I swear its programmed in that way by some sadist at Big Smoke Detector). you are going to want to have a 9 volt ready.  Because you are not the kind of monster who would let your family burn to death (well probably smoke to death if we are honest) cause you were too cheap or lazy to replace the battery.  That's not how you want to get on the local news (that or &#34;local cat hoarder in Guinness Book of World Records&#34;).Given that these have the &#34;Durablock&#34; feature they have a long guaranteed shelf life. so feel free to splurge on this 4 pack of 9 volts.  You will be safe. and feel like a big spender."
1,"Of all the batteries I use. I really dislike D size. They're heavy. and I understand that they have to be. So the question was. do I want to spend a small fortune on rechargeable D's or get the tried an true Duracell D. You know the answer. I use these in one huge flashlight and in two motion sensor lights on our house. I can't tell you that these are better than the bunny batteries. but from my experience. these just keep going. and going. and going. Since the motion sensors are used on a nightly basis (the sensors have picked up raccoons. skunks. and opossums which we didn't even know we had in suburbia). I think it's amazing that we haven't had to replace the batteries yet. and the light is still as strong as ever."
1,"I've used Duracell batteries for years. and they've always been reliable. I would like to mention two things that stood out with the most recent D-cell Duracells (8-count package) that I bought in the 8-pack:* The expiration date is December 2023. more than ten years after I purchased them.* The packaging is some of the best that I've seen for batteries. and if you don't need all eight of them now. the packaging also serves as a nice. resealable container. Also. it was extremely easy to open. needing only a small pair of scissors to cut where indicated.I also recently purchased an 8-count package of Duracell C-cells. The same comments apply. except that the packaging is different (cardboard instead of plastic) than the packaging the D-cells came in. and the expiration date is only nine years out.Call me a very satisfied customer."
1,"Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap."
1,"This is just a battery right? (Duracell Coppertop with Duralock)The D cells I received from Amazon have a expiration date on the battery Dec 2022. Bought these Dec 2012. so I get 10years. See photo in customer photo section.Great to see expiration date on battery!!  NO MORE GUESSING if they're too old.My D cells came in a plastic box suitable for storage.Price here on Amazon for 8 D cell was much lower than any retail outlet.Good price. fresh batteries. 5 starsShips from and Sold by Amazon"
1,"Duracell batteries are my favorite for reliability and endurance.  In my opinion. they provide more continuous output than any other competitor battery. The chief competitor. Energizer. does not last as long in my appliances than does the Duracell.  So. when I buy batteries. I buy Duracell.  This said. be aware of the following facts:  Duracell's cost slightly more than Energizers. so perhaps the Energizers are more economical in the long-run.  Second. always check the expiration date on the batteries.  If the expiration date is near. return them and ask for the package with the  longest expiration date.  Finally. store batteries in the refrigerator for longest storage life.  Shelf life at room temperature depletes all batteries.kone"
1,"Needed to purchase these to power a portable fan. Came well packaged with no damage (from Amazon proper) and the expiration date was years in advance.  Batteries performed as expected. pricing a bit more than 3 hours of continuous power to a portable fan set on &#8220;high&#8221;......  Basically. these are very expensive to use and other types of batteries (re: rechargeable) would be a better purchase although there are just times when only a &#8220;D&#8221; Cell will do.As long as there is no visible damage and your exp. date is ok. these Duracell Alkaline Coppertops should perform well. I have never had any trouble with them over the years."
1,"Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks.  Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries.  I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong:  They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes.  Note to seller:  How long did you think you'd get away with selling dead (and possibly fake) batteries?  Note to Amazon:  Please investigate this seller!"
1,"I purchased quite a few toys over Christmas that required batteries. Luckily Amazon has batteries at a low price in large bulk to cover my needs.The batteries show up in Amazons no frills frustration free packaging with an expiration date several days out. Other individuals. unfortunately. have received batteries near or past their expiration date as well as less than acceptable packaging. I would do two things:1) Make sure when you are ordering the batteries that you are ordering from amazon itself and not one of the other vendors that may pop up replacing amazon.2) When you receive the batteries make sure you check the expiration date of the batteries and. if you have a volt checker. test the batteries.Overall a good deal on a wide variety of sizes and quantities."

1,"I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page. it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews. many buyers received their batteries unpackaged. just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago. I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are. but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time."
1,"I buy 2 packs of these EVERY MONTH for work. We use them for a digital scale built into our forklifts. This is in use 8 hours a day. 5 days a week... standard 40 hours. I get them with Subscribe & Save. I don't think you can possibly get similar quality for the price. and rechargeable D Batteries!? Yea right!! With the risk of damaging the batteries here. I don't think so. Not for that price. Duracell is the way to go!"
1,"We have been using Duracell for many years. and have always trusted our camping and emergency needs and devices we use to being powered by them. in one form or another.  Sure there are cheaper batteries out there. rechargeable even and solar too; and of course Duracell has their versions of all of these.We do believe in being green. and doing the best to keep our energy footprint small. and we have found over the years we can count on the Copper top for most of our needs.  And of course we should all dispose of them properly."
1,"Duracell Coppertop Duralock D batteries are premium quality batteries. as reflected in their price.  They seem to last longer than every other kind of battery I have purchased.  Although I haven't actually done any laboratory testing. they have been in a particular flashlight I have and have been in there working for about 10 years.  In a crisis or long duration power failure event. these are my first choice for survival.If you are looking for the best battery on the market. I think these are it."
1,"In general. Duracell and Enrrgizer perform significantly better than more generic battrries in terms of battery life. Yhese are no exception. I used them in a stompbox. and even though this is primsrily for practice and jamming. i don't want interruptions to change the batteries. These don't disappoint.The pricing of Duracell on Amazon has also been much better than I can get locally. Before I bought these. I tried three drugstores and one supermarket to see ifIi could pick up a better deal. It wasn't possible. The batteries I could find locally were runnng almost twice as much as these Duracells on Amazon. As long ss that remains the case. I will continue to buy online."
1,"A Christmas gift for 2 young boys who love to wander thru the woods near their house at night.  They have found goblins. trolls. werewolves. and lions. tigers. and bears....(if you wish to believe their tales!)  They are small in size but very. very bright and the light projects for a great distance.  We can sit on our back porch and tell about where they are by watching the light beam in the trees.They now also turn our couches upside down to make a tent and use their lights to read and play by.  They do that even in the daylight!  The batteries have not yet been replaced after many hours of use.  They made a great gift and got them away from the TV and computer games.  That is the biggest benefit in my opinion."
1,"I have had several maglites over the years and while reading the reviews decided to get this light because it is LED. WRONG. for some reason most of the reviews are on the LED version and this light is the battery eating krypton version.I have drawers full of these old ones and don't use them because they are just old inefficient technology.I was bummed out and requested a refund and planned to refuse the fedex shipment. But when I cancelled the order they said to just keep it. I really don't wont the damned thing but I think it would cost them more if I now refuse the package.Moral quandary.Maybe I'll upgrade it with the LED kit.UPDATE####################I bumped it up a star because it is now perfect since I added the L.E.D. mod kit by Nite-ize.It now has 25 hour battery life and is twice as bright."
1,"I've dropped my Maglite onto hard floors. submerged it in water. and subjected it to the abuses of a tornadic four year old. The all metal (not plastic!) case is nearly indestructible. Both ends are threaded and are fitted with snug o-rings to protect the innards from rain. humidity. and submersion. The lens housing twists to adjust the focus of the beam and comes off to allow it to be used as a candle (handy for nights in a tent or during a power outage). In addition. an extra bulb resides in the base!"
1,"Do NOT buy a Maglite product unless it's an LED light. Non-LED Maglite products are crap and do not have any usefulness in modern society. LEDs are the wave of the future and yet Maglite is still producing these style of flashlights. When I got the flashlight and turned it on for the first time. I could not believe how dim the light was. It's barely 10 lumens. if that. Do NOT waste your money on this product. Buy a pen light such as a Streamlight Pro or something of that nature that will accept AA's but can output over 50 lumens of light energy. Much more cost effective. lighter. more efficient and overall a better product. I'm sure Maglite is producing LED lights so if you do get one it will most likely be a good flashlight just do not get this particular style."
1,"I was taking part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine. and everyone had two tools: a Mini Maglite and aLeatherman.  They all wore them on their belts. and they came in handy on numerous occasions.  Of course I picked one up and I love the little holster that comes with it.  If it didn't look dorky I'd probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time.It's not just good for night use.  Changing a fuse. adjusting equipment. finding something under the desk.  For those kinds of everyday. all-the-time uses. the Mini Mag is much more handy and useful than the largerMAGLITE. which I also own and keep in my closet for emergencies and camping.  Highly recommended for its simplicity. utility. and durability."

1,"We have been buying these Maglite Mini flashlights for quite a while. I have yet to try their LED version. but for now these work perfectly for me. I know that the LED one is supposedly much better. but at this price point. I have a very hard time passing these up.We probably must have about 3 or 4 of these around our home. and I personally keep 1 in every toolbag or toolbox. With the cheap price of these you can have one in every room and anywhere else you can think of. You also have a wide variety of colors to choose from. but I stick to the modest. classic black annodized.I know that this is just a review for a simple flashlight. but I believe Maglite to be the best. and I hope this review helps."
1,"focus-able beam is nice. I had already bought a TeraLUX ministar2 extreme upgrade for my existing mag and liked it so much I decided to buy this to put it in a less scratched up case. for a conventional bulb the stock bulb is not very bright and unless you have a led module for it already or know enough about electronics to make one I would buy the mini mag LED. If you do know enough about electronics you can buy led lights. cut the leads and add your own heat sink for fairly cheap from parts here on amazon. I did this to my old mini mag (you can find instructions on instructables) and not as bright as the TeraLUX but 2-3 times brighter than stock for $2 in parts."
1,"I have been a fan of Maglite as long as I can remember. I don't want a flashlight that breaks easily because when I need it. I NEED IT. The Maglite line has alway been durable and solid and feels good in the hand. The design is well thought out like the 'candle mode' to light a space.This package has a nice holster. but it is small enough to fit easily in most pockets. Over the years I never had to replace the halogen bulb in a maglite but they typicall provide one spare in the bottom just in case. That kind of thoughtful reliablity plus nice design make this as great as the bigger ones.There are two of these in my house plus a LED model too. In my opinion this mini-maglite does everything I need very reliably. I can depend on it when it counts.Hope this helps someone."
1,"mini lite was just the right size for me to use when I am fixing or repairing something and need a different size of light rays to see something tiny or in detail.  The size of the barrel of the flashlight is great for my hands when I need both of them to use and can just use my fingers to grasp instead of the whole hand.  Brightness of bulb is excellent since you can adjust the rays to be full or small to see just the focus of something detail.  Light also came with an upholster to store and wear on your body so you can carry for camping use or hiking use or even for your work when needed.  It is convenient to have in a holder so you don't have to hand carry it.  Great product for the price you pay."
1,"This big pack was a huge problem solver for us.  We don't have a car so we navigate the shopping chores carefully.  We are within walking distance of many different stores and we do have a hardware store nearby but the usual purchase of a regular box was used quickly which meant constantly walking to the hardware store for refills.  Buying these has been a big relief for me. since I do most of the walking.  I am still using these and it has been MONTHS.  I will do this every time. The price is not painful and the large number of bags makes it a real deal."
1,"We use these bags in two of our trashcans in the kitchens.  We have a kitchen on the main floor and in the basement and these 13 gallon bags are just the right size for our kitchen trash containers.  By the end of the week they are pretty full and we dump some smaller trash cans into the sacks as there is still room and then they are full to the top.  I have never had one leak or tear on me and I like the tie flaps to close the bag securely and to carry it outside.This is a good product and we will continue to use it and I recommend it to you.  The price here is high compared to what we are paying and you might want to shop around."
1,"I'm clueless as to whom these trashbags are marketed. I bought them and find them pretty annoying. For one thing they DO NOT 'stretch and grab' as the marketing info says. They just hang there. If you want grabbing. try Hefties &#34;Hefty Gripper Tall. 13 Gallon Kitchen Bags). They're awesome.The other thing Easy-Flaps don't do is hold as much garbage as other Tall Kitchen bags. Because of their construction they barely fit our can. plus unless you under-fill them. there is not way to tie them off.The only good point about these bags is that they are 1 mil plastic. Otherwise they fall far short of what's needed in the kitchen."
1,"I am the dishwasher in my home. and I like good tools. It's been a slog to find a truly good dish brush. and here it is. I used the amazon.com info and went to Ace and found the same brush sold individually. Bought one. and have been using it now for two months. It cleans very well. is easy to keep from getting clogged. and it doesn't splay out bristles very much. I've trimmed off about half a dozen bristles all in all. and the brush still has a lot of life left in it. The UPC at Ace for the individual brush is 0 4130104554 3. I like this brush enough to think that I'll buy the dozen-pack when this one gets too far gone. Washing dishes with a good brush makes a lot of difference."
1,"We're not much pleased with this brush. It's way smaller than we wanted and. owing to the angle of the head. one has to get their hand in much closer in to the grubby dish or pot they're scrubbing. That makes it hard to apply much force. We bought another brush in the same order. the Libman Kitchen Brush which Amazon also sells and which is a mite cheaper. It's a far better brush. bigger and better designed. This one is ok but not good enough to recommend."
1,"Review for: Rubbermaid Dish BrushA review for the humble dish brush.  I'm not sure what it is about this one but I prefer doing dishes with it more than the many other kitchen dish brushes I've tried from various retail stores and supermarkets.  I'll gladly waste time looking for this one buried in the sink before using another one just sitting there looking at me longingly.Like a car that lets you still feel the road. the bristles are flexible and unbunched enough you can get hard pressure right into the problem spots.  Flip it around and you get nice scraping action.  Use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots.This same flexibility means it won't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles. however even scrunched up it still continues to work great.  So hats off to this simple. classic rubbermaid dish brush standing the test of time."
1,"I used these when I went on a month long safari. Had no chance of resupply and did not want to take too many standard batteries as I found in my experience that the high humidity. despite being in a tight container. drained most of the charge before I used them. Took two sets of these lithium AA plus other brands as backup. Didn't need them as the one set in my camera and one set in my recorder were still working good after I had returned. They endured over 100F to a 32F at night. 90% humidity. heavy rain. damn mosquitoes (ah..wait..that was my gripe) and worked very well. Did not have a problem with having to wait for them to recharge my units like other cheaper brands."
1,"The flat discharge curve of lithiums means they will stay above the UVLO (Under-Voltage Lock Out) conditions of your electronics power supplies. Today's electronics do not just keep working until all the juice is gone. They monitor the input voltage and when it drops too low to guarantee a stable output. they shut off. Normal batteries may still have some juice left in them but nothing other than flashlights can really make use of it. Lithiums go most of the way from full health to death in a relatively flat curve so your electronics will get longer life. Maybe only 10% to 15% wasted energy left when done compared to 40%+The price is worth it."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
1,"In an outside sensor for an indoors weather station. these batteries rock. I spent years with my outside weather readings coming and going before I read the manual and saw that they now suggest Lithium batteries. Stuck a pair of these dudes into the remote sensor and have not had a problem in cold weather. With the Duracells. and I love Duracells. I was always loosing my outside temperatures anywhere below 30 degrees (F). So far I have gotten to -4 (F) with no dropouts. Very nice."
1,"These lithium batteries are great. They are long lasting. lightweight and work great in freezing temperatures. Their 'BEST BY' date is often ten years or more. If you have a device in a fridge or freezer or outside where it gets cold/freezing. then these are very useful since alkaline batteries will often fail in cold temperatures. They are also useful for devices that are inconvenient to change batteries. like clocks or wireless outdoor temperature or motion sensors. If you're wealthy. then you might as well use these instead of alkaline or rechargeables. but because of the relatively high cost. I only use these for 'special' applications. Otherwise I use alkalines or Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries."
1,"These batteries really let you drain every little bit out of them. Make sure you use them in the correct devices. as others mentioned. They worked great in a digital camera w/ flash. I tried to use them in a headlamp - and they didn't fair so well. However even after I thought they were dead. if you let them 'sit' for a little while. you can come back and get a little more life out of them (few more shots/flash. light. etc). It was kind of funny how many times the camera would power off. and I'd let it sit for an hour and come back to find there was some juice back in them. If you have a high drain electronic device or you need longevity/cold temps in your battery - then definitely give these a try. However if you have more average/lower draw electronics. these may not seem to last as long and can be quite expensive comparatively to alkalines."
1,"I got these batteries specifically for my wife's digital camera and have been pleased with their performance to this point. When I first tested them on my battery tester they pegged the needle with their power; I've never seen another battery do that.They've been in my wife's camera now for several weeks and I test them again before we take it out for use and each time they've showed a full charge which has surprised me. If anything develops noteworthey I'll update my review but so far they have exceeded my expectations."
1,"We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic.  We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters. Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference. The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters: TIP: I did find it best to purchase and use &#34;Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#34; AA cells. Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics (and you don't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months)."
1,"I bought these batteries thinking they where rechargable. but they aren't!These batteries lasted a very long time. I would say about 4-6x longer than my rechargeable batteries. in my ebook reader.Pro's:Long enduranceHigh power outputExcellent for both high power devices (like digital camera's or flash) as low power devices (clock or ebook reader).Cons:Non-rechargableDon't last as long as they mention on the package (4-6x not 8x longer than rechargeables. and about 2x longer than Duracell batteries)Conclusion:I would never buy these batteries for the sole reason that they are non rechargable.Otherwise they are excellent for small electronic devices like clocks and small portable radio's and ebook readers.For high power devices. though these batteries are excellent. I would especially recommend to get rechargeables!"
1,"Bought these for some trail cameras taking videos. with sound. field scan etc.  Are holding up well (better than new Alkaline)  and the price was great. They also have a listed Shelf Life of 15 years. and are supposed to last 9 times longer than Alkaline batteries with high drain applications. I recommend the product and the seller Brooklyn Battery Works.  Purchased some more of these from Mel Pierce Camera (an actual store but on Amazon too)  at a cheaper price and they were delivered fast. Reason I mentioned the sellers is due to what appears to be some scammers selling them . Both these sellers are fine. fast. priced fair. new in the package."
1,"Generally. I have many positive experiences on Amazon with the exception of this vendor. Please let me explain; I received these batteries and noticed that they had an expiration date of 2027. Wow! I was 'pleasantly surprised' for the long shelf life. I then placed the batteries in my drive way alarm and noticed that my drive-way alarm did not work properly. I immediately thought that I had a defective drive-way alarm. However. I decided to check the volts of these batteries with my multimeter and was quickly surprised that 5 batteries out of 8 were defective and actually was only producing less that 1 volt. They should be 1.5 volts. After contacting the vendor. they had me send the batteries back for testing which I had to pay for. Since then. I have not heard hide nor hair from this company. They will not communicate with me. That's wrong! Do yourself a favor and purchase these somewhere else...."
1,"Hopefully these perform as described. They are exactly what I need. but who can tell until they run down how long they will work? While I was away from my Home this winter. the alkaline batteries in my programmable thermostat died and did not turn on my heating system. I barely missed getting frozen pipes. If they perform as described they will be cheap insurance for repeating this problem. but I don't know if they will work for even 10 years. but certainly I can count on a couple of years from them. fingers crossed."
1,"They are used in an Acurite weather station that we purchased.  The weather station has an outdoor sender that it mounted on our patio.  During the coldest parts of the year. the temperature on the patio can be in the teens.  Acurite. in the manual that comes with the weather station. recommends that lithium batteries be used in the outdoor sensor.As recommended by Acurite. we used the lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor.  We purchased these batteries about a year ago.  So far. the batteries have performed flawlessly.  We haven't yet had to replace the batteries in the sensor so I can't comment on their life. except to say that it's at least a year. at least for our type of use."
1,"These are expensive for daily use. I'd recommend NiMH rechargeables for that. but they're perfect for low temperature use (car flashlight in Minnesota winter. digital camera use outdoors in the winter) when both alkalines and NiMHs fail to deliver. These would also be. with very gradual storage loss. great for an emergency electronic device. Maybe for GPS or LED flashlight. Do check that your electronics are happy with these batteries installed. I've heard of both digital cameras and GPS units (Garmin GPS60) that did not."
1,"There are a lot of people that need more of a charge with electronics that only alkaline batteries cannot do. especially today's standard of electronics. Energizer has made that accomplishment with their Ultimate Lithium batteries. They work absolutely well in my hi-tech chargers for my Iphone and Ipod Touch. without the hassle of charging it to my computer all the time. They are simple to use and work great. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they can run. but when I tried them in my instant Energizer Charger. I was convinced that they were excellent at the power they have given me into my player. If you have a smartphone or a camera that needs more than alkaline batteries. I definitely recommend you give these a try from Energizer.Price: BCharging: B+Overall: B 1/2+"
1,"For almost everything in my household I use Sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries. and could not be more pleased with them.  However. I recently purchase several LED emergency road flares. and wanted batteries which I wouldn't need to check frequently.  While the eneloops are also good for long term storage in the cold. they discharge faster when it is hot. and don't perform as well in the cold as these lithium batteries. which are rated down to -40F.  If you need these for more heavily used devices. you might want to get rechargeables. but these store well and operate in a wide range of temperatures."
1,"I've just ordered a second supply of these batteries. The first set I used in a pair of salt and pepper grinders. The first thing I noticed is that they seemed to be more powerful than the Duracell batteries I was using before. They are still running strong after three month's of constant use. I would highly recommend Energizer Ultimate Lithimum batteries to anyone looking for the best. longest lasting battery. I am thouroughly satisfied with them.UPDATE: It's now been over four months and they are still going strong. I've purchased another pack of 8 just to keep them on hand when I need them. They have a 15 year shelf life so I'm not worried about them going bad over time."
1,"I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent. fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time. retain power even when they're just sitting not being used. and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls. Wii remotes. toys. etc.)."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
1,"I bought these for a digital camera which went through alkalines every 30 photos. After researching how alkalines drop to about 1.2 volts after very little use and then level out from there I learned that these lithiums maintain the 1.5 volts for a much longer period of use and consequently allow my camera to continue to work through about 120 to 150 photos. I also use these in the outside unit of my weather station because they will not fail at subzero temperatures like alkalines do. The added cost is worth it in some instances but probably not for general use."
1,"These are 'niche' batteries. They weigh half their Alkaline and NiMh brothers. store more energy. work in very low temperatures. and sit on the shelf for a decade without losing their charge.As everyday consumables they make no sense (for that. look into Eneloop rechargeables). But as the cells that power your emergency flashlight. your GPS on the Inka Trail. or your radio during a blackout. they are a godsend.Note that the voltage of these cells is slightly higher than regular AA's. Therefore. some devices actually *won't work*. at least not when the cells are fresh and fully charged! For example. people have posted problems with Garmin's Gpsmap 60csx or some regulated LED flashlights. I'd recommend you check with the manufacturer and test your device with those cells before placing them in your survival kit."
1,"got 'em quick with no problems. yes they absolutely last longer [I use them in a lable maker]. These are great batteries but are not for every app. I do not recommend using the 9v version in a smoke detector. The lithium bateries by nature go until they are completely exausted then suddenly they are completely spent wih no warning. The alkilne batteries slowly get weaker thus letting the detector let out those annoying squeeks which tell you the detector's batteries need changing. Not to keen of a flashlite blinking out with no warning. But. the tremendious shelf life and longer runs between changes is a real plus.PS Check to see that you are getting the correct ones for your needs. They have different life spands of lasting 4.5.8 and the ultimate of 9 times longer than alkiline batts."
1,"I bought these batteries specifically to go in the outdoor portion of my indoor-outdoor weather monitoring station. I tried normal alkaline batteries first. but they do not provide enough voltage when the temperature is low. Then I tried NiMH rechargeables. but those crap out at an even higher temperature. Then I coughed up the extra money for lithium. i.e. these batteries.These batteries are the only ones that work when it is very cold outside. Lithium wins!These are approximately the cheapest lithium batteries on Amazon. that is how I chose them. And they are a name brand. Go figure."
1,"i was uneducated in lithium batteries. i thought they were rechargeable. but have come to get info from energizer via their telephone rep..that only lithium ion batteries are rechargeable...that lithium batteries as these are NOT.to me then. the price value is just not there. for the price paid for these i can buy around 36 good alkaline cells.update: i have found these batteries to not last as long as regular alkaline batteries....e.g. i get about 6 months use on a clock from an alkaline but only two months on these lithiums....obviously then i will stick with alkaline over these....i have tho moved to using rechargeable cells for nearly everything anymore- usually the enelop from sanyo- these are very good and certainly cost effective..."
1,"I ordered this scrub brush with the intent of using it on sinks and showers. I first used it when I threw my microfiber couch cushions in the laundry and they came out stiff. I used this brush to easily bring back the softness that microfiber is known for.Since then I have used it for sinks. tile. shower. and linoleum. It has worked fabulously each and every time and it is now my go to scrub brush. It is extremely comfortable in my hand. they did a fantastic job with the ergonomics. It is easy to apply gentle or firm pressure based on the situation.If you need a versatile brush that works well and is comfortable in your hand. this is it."
1,"When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They. by far. have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much. I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time. I think I'll get two :)"
1,"I expect a scrub brush to be designed for medium/heavy pressure.  The shape of the handle in my hand doesn't allow me to just press down and do the job.  Rather. the roundness of the handle wobbles back and forth (left to right versus back and forth) in my palm.  Also when wet the handle doesn't feel solid in my palm.  Maybe it's just the shape of my hand instead of a design flaw?  I only deducted one star for this possibility.The bristles are high quality and the plastic piece appears of the OXO quality you'd expect."
1,"I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet. they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower. sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find. but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time. your hands and wrist will feel the difference."
1,"I have always kept a hefty scrub brush around for I have an old kitty that loves to toss up her dinner occasionally. plus a young puppy that often feels left out and follows suit.  Scrub brushes are easy to find and probably never considered here much on Amazon.  But trust me when I tell you that not only is this a terrific brush. but it is also very hard to find in stores.  The power behind this baby is its contoured plum like handle that sits directly on top.  It gives you maximum comfort for your hand while directing the brushes where you want without you getting tired and the brushes just slipping lightly over the stain.  The handle and the brushes are of a great quality and and I bought two for different parts of the house.  Definitely a vast improvement over the usual handles we all are used to seeing on brushes like this. and at a very fair price here on Amazon. The best. and highly recommended..."
1,"After reading the reviews. and recognizing the quality of OXO. I thought I had made a good decision. I was in for a surprise. I have one of those old tubs with some soap build up that is difficult to remove. With a little elbow grease. and with this superb brush. the soap scum is gone. Good grief. what a surprise. For years I have been trying to get that stuff off.  I am now going to scrub my stair carpet. Somehow. coffee stains have ingrained themselves into the rug.The raised handle keeps my hands and fingers above the brush. which makes it so much easier to use your full force. Thecontoured handle gives me a strong grasp for vigorous cleaning. The handle is nonslip. wet or dry. It is great for cleaning a variety of surfaces. from tile to carpet. There are two types of bristles for the optimum scrub. I have never found anything better for scrubbing out those darn spots!Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-08-14"
1,"I just LOVE this brush.  Not only does it &#34;feel good&#34; to the hand. but it's design allows you to easily get into the rounded corners of the bathtub whereas a flat. rectangular shaped brush made rounded areas difficult to clean.  The non-slip rubber grip is a plus as well.  I'm really happy with this purchase.  Will buy again when I need a replacement.  Have been using it for over 10 months and it shows no signs of wear.  Very satisfied."
1,"I had one of this brush already. but wanted another for outside. I use my inside one to clean tubs and shower tile mainly. and anything else that needs the work of its sturdy bristles. I use the outside one for dirty or mucky shoes. and to clean out our two flat. rectangular bird feeders that hang outside in the weather. If it rains or snows. the feeders get pretty nasty inside on the bottom. but we like them as they allow the birds. squirrels and chipmunks to all be able get into the trays to eat."
1,"This bottle brush is great. We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses. It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you're cleaning. Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I've used it on. I'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
1,"i have tried many brands and types of bottle brush and now i finally found the one.this brush is just enough soft and flexible to clean bottles well. The bristles are soft and yet sturdy to withstand pressure. Unlike rubber/silicone based brush whose bristles have no strength to stand straight. this will easily clean corner without having to jam the brush into the corner.Another good feature is the lenght. it is around a foot long. so you can use it to clean your vacuum flask/thermos easily as well."
1,"It is surprisingly hard to find a brush like this. I just wanted it to be able to clean my travel mugs really well. I don't like putting them in the dishwasher and a sponge does not reach everywhere. This is a great brush for a good price. I have been using it for about a year and it still looks great. the bristles do not wear easily so I think it will last for a long time. I am now able to reach all those touch spots in my travel mugs. carafes. and vases."
1,"It's a good sturdy brush. bends well. fits in what I need it for. but the bristles are only slightly rougher than a generic bottle brush. I use it clean glass bottles I fill with juice (from a juicer). and it doesn't get anything stuck on. It also stains easy. However. the grip is comfortable and it's a good length for 16oz glass bottles. and if you can find a different way to get things unstuck. it works just fine. I just wish it was rougher and a little longer wouldn't hurt. It does the job but aside from real sturdiness it's not much better than a generic brush."
1,"Got this for cleaning out sport bottles and stainless thermal coffee cups.  Flexible.  The bristles are not very dense and the bristle material is very light.  This is NOT a scrub brush. and I actually have concerns about how long the lightweight nylon bristles will hold up over time. but this gets the job done.  The brush will fit into anything the width of the wand portion at the top. because the bristles are so soft. they flatten out and flow (almost like wet hair...)."
1,"I have always struggled cleaning my tea pot and my Nalgene water bottles.  I would stuff washcloths into them and spin them around but I never felt like I was doing a good job.  I saw this cheap little brush on amazon and figured I'd give it a go.  This brush helps me all the time now.  It can squeeze into the holes my hand can't fit in and I can move it around and scrub the insides.  I am impressed with this brush and am very glad I found it."
1,"This is astoundingly dishwasher tolerant. It has emerged unscathed from the top rack of my dishwasher after pots and pans wash. 6 or 7 times already.Initially. I bought this to clean my tall ello glass water bottle with a narrow opening.  Now I use it on all hand wash serving and glassware.  The bristles are effectively scrub-y. are high quality soft nylon that doesn't scratch glass and collapses to fit into narrow mouth jars and bottles.  The handle is hand injury friendly with typical soft OXO comfort with appropriate density for a secure grip. A+"
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
1,"I use this to clean out all sorts of cups and bottles and it always maintains its shape.  Been using it for almost a year now and its still going strong.  Its really only for light cleaning though because the brush bristles are too soft to do much scrubbing. but they are the right softness to easily squish into a small bottle opening. which is what I bought it for.  I'd buy it again with the knowledge that its just a light duty brush specifically for water bottles/jugs."
1,"We have had a couple really nice bottle brushes that have recently just given up completely and we needed replacements fast.  We looked at all the stores we regularly haunt. but did not find anything of a satisfactory type and quality.  So online I went and found this great sounding brush and decided to give it a tryout. so far it has performed flawlessly cleaning all sizes and shapes of bottles and containers of all types as well.  Overall this has been a great purchase. and I hope they have these in the future for when this one gives up the ghost in a few years..."
1,"This bottle brush is well made and GREAT for most things. but it has a THICK stem that will NOT go into regular size water bottles. so don't buy it for that! I tried to use it on the VOSS water bottle I use (recycle.) and for spice bottles. and my sport jug - it was hopeless. You need a regular old fashioned 'baby bottle' brush with the thin wire stem for regular drinking bottles. OR TRY this incredible brush:Way Clean 33030 Bottle Brushwhich is under four dollars AND has a thinner shaft to fit more bottles. glasses. etc. and which is SLANTED to facilitate a thorough cleaning!"
1,"This brush is the best especially to clean out small mouthed bottles of all kinds & pitchers. To me the best part of this brush is it's flexibility to reach places that normal plain brushes can't reach like unreachable cracks. crevices & bends & curved glass. This thing rocks & I am very very happy that I purchased it & I will be telling a lot of people about it because it makes cleaning pitchers. water bottles. jars & any think a breeze to clean & I most definitely am extremely satisfied with this wonderful product & wonderful seller that packaged my product so well. Go get one you will be very happy that you did so."
1,"I am becoming an OXO Superfan simply because their products meet most of my kitchen needs fully.  Of those OXO products I have. not one has failed and each has performed as advertised. but with more effectiveness than I expected based on their modest prices.  I bought this brush mainly to accompany a 6-pack of 18 ounce glass water bottles that would be hard to reach without a bristle brush.  In goes the OXO and out comes the unwanted material.  Luckily. the contents have been nothing but water and nothing else that we know of.  A simple and effective brush goes a long way around here and we highly recommend this one."
1,"Great bottle brush for our household with three kids who all play sports.  So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices.  This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles.  (And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles.)  My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time. so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months.  I always buy the same one again. but I wish it lasted a bit longer!"
1,"I received this last week.  I bought it to clean jars and glasses.  Does not feel flimsy. does a good job.  The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality.  This is in a whole different class.. it works!  I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012:  This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR.  I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one.  Talk about value for money spent!"
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
1,"Sometimes a little thing makes a big difference and having the right tool for the job is one of those things.  I use a meat grinder several times a week to make pet food for cats and make sausages for myself. This requires scrupulous attention to cleanliness.  One of the parts was a little hard to clean on the inside. but this bottle brush makes the job a breeze.  It is both flexible enough to easily clean the interior. while the bristles are soft enough not to scratch the metal.  I also found it to be an excellent tool for cleaning the square glass containers that I use to store milk in the refrigerator.  As you know square kitchen containers can be tricky to clean.  This brush is long enough for half gallon containers. but it could be a little short for larger containers.  For my purposes. this brush would have been a good purchase at twice the price."
1,"I have had this brush for over two years now and I use it constantly. The colored end bristles are a little stiffer then the white ones so it's great for the bottom of jars especially the ones you have to clean for recycling. Makes hard work a breeze. After extreme daily use it still looks brand new. I just put it in a glass with bleach and water every so often to keep it nice and fresh. I purchased two and the other one is still under the sink with the tag still on it because I just can't wear this thing out! I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I bought one for a friend who looked at me like I was insane when I raved about it and now she tells all her friends to get one too! Get this brush. it is an amazing very well made cleaning tool!"
1,"My large hands make it very difficult to wash the bottom of my insulated coffee mugs (the manufacturers recommend not putting them in the dishwasher). A regular wire core bottle brush does not work very well because there are not enough bristles on the bottom and the wire always bent the wrong way. This brush solves those issues quite well - there are plenty of bristles on the bottom. and the plastic handle flexes and allows extra pressure in the corners yet still returns to its original shape. The bristles are softer than those found on most bottle brushes. but still seem to do the job. I don't know how durable it will be. but my past experience with OXO products has been very good. so I expect this brush to last a long time."
1,"My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!"
1,"BOTTLE TYPES WE OWNWe have numerous water bottles and stainless containers (Foogoo. Camelbak. Thermos to name a few).  Some are BPA free plastic. some stainless inside and out.BOTTLE NECK SIZEThe neck opening of each of our bottles varies from 1.5 inches up to 3 inches (this is a Foogoo lunch container).BRUSH BRISTLES AND PERFORMANCEThis brush is the best one we have tried (we have tried three other brands).  The bristles are firm enough to clean the bottles. but soft enough not to scratch them (unlike others we have tried).  The handle just below the brush is flexible so it bends making it very easy to get every nook and cranny in all our containers.We use it on a daily basis.  I donated our other ones after receiving this."
1,"Put quite simply. OXO has done it again!  The quality of this Good Grips Bottle Brush exceeds all expectations in both design and execution.  The engineers at OXO are experts at what they do and their dedication to customer satisfaction is clearly seen in this superb brush.  Anyone who has purchased any OXO product will testify to the satisfaction one feels in using said product as well as the incredible value OXO always presents.  The OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush satisfies as no other brush possibly can because no other proudly displays OXO on the label.  OXO defines value. excellence. durability. and satisfaction and the Good Grips Bottle Brush is virtually OXO writ large."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
1,"I just got this product yesterday.  I used it to clean out 4 of my water bottles and their lids.  Along with a long handle. the brush has bristles that stick up on the top and allow me to clean the bottome of the bottle very easily.  The brush also cleaned up under the rim of the bottles easily due to the direction of the bottom bristles.  It rinsed off easily and dried quickly.  So far. so good.  If it falls apart within 6 months I'll revise my review; otherwise I'd recomend it for cleaning water bottles/baby bottles/etc."
1,"I have a SIGG water bottle that needed cleaning. My first search resulted in a special SIGG brush that was ~$9. This was ~$4. In combination with Efferdent tablets. this brush works great to clean and refresh the bottle and remove the metallic-y smell from my bottle. (DONT BUY THE SIGG TABLETS -- SIGG Tablets are 24 tablets for ~$8 while Efferdent. which works EXACTLY the same. is 120 tablets for ~$6!!!). Be smart people; Don't buy the SIGG branded stuff since this brush (and the Efferdent tablets) work just the same. if not better for a lot less money."
1,"I like this brush. though I do wish it had a suction cup. or something. so it would be easier to be near the sink.  We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job. though. even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand. and while it was nice. the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.  For the price these are easy to replace when necessary."
1,"OXO generally makes a good product. This is a nice brush. But for cleaning out my NISSAN 34oz themas it barely does the job. The handle should be about 3 to 4 inches longer and the bristles could be a little stiffer. A mix of stiff and softer bristles would be ideal. It works well for cleaning out my NISSAN Tea tumbler. Stiffer bristles would make getting the little ring of fine tea leaf residue that always seems to collect at the bottom and just wont rinse out at the end of the day when I finally get home. Its a good product just room for improvement."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
1,"This bottle brush works really well to clean my stainless steel 27 oz water bottle. Here is why I like it:1. The diameter on the opening of my water bottle is 1 3/4 inches. and this easily fits inside.2. The handle and brush combined are a foot long. which makes it very easy to clean the bottom of the bottle.3. The leading negative review mentions another brush that has a slanted handle. which supposedly makes cleaning easier. But the handle on this brush is very flexible. and will bend and slant at whatever angle you want with just a little pressure.4. The bristles are effective at cleaning both the bottom and sides of the water bottle.5. The grip on the end of the handle is somewhat thicker. which makes it easy and comfortable to hold this brush while cleaning.Bottom line: This is sturdy and well made. and cleans effectively."
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
1,"I love the Polar thermal water bottles.  But they have 'dimples' in the sides of them that make them difficult to clean.  All my cycling bottles collect a lot of fine road dirt in them.  Until now. I've mostly lived with some residual dirt in the bottle.  I add soapy water. close and shake.  That gets most of the ick out. but not all.  But this brush is THE BEST brush for cleaning out my cycling bottles.  The handle is long enough to reach the bottom of all my drinking bottles and gallon glass juice jars.  The bristles are soft enough that the brush can be inserted into narrow neck bottles.  And they are stiff enough to do a good job of cleaning.  I don't believe in purchasing lots of specialized cleaning gadgets. but this on is a must."
1,"This is a great brush.  I use it for my 32oz Nalgene bottles and it works fine. but I also use it for my 16oz Takeya Glass Bottles and it especially works AWESOME for those because it touches all the sides of the bottle when it's in it!  When it's in the Nalgene bottle you have to circle it around to get all the sides. but not so with the smaller diamater bottles.  Handle is the perfect length and the bristles still stick out and look fine after 6 months of use."
1,"Does a great job of cleaning out my protein shaker bottles.  I used to just use a sponge. but I couldn't get in the little crevices (like the shaker spout) to get out the protein that had dried in there.  With this brush. I can easily get into little corners. while also scrubbing out my shaker quickly and efficiently.  The bristles are also soft enough that it won't scuff up the plastic shaker.  All in all. I would consider this a must for anyone who doesn't have access to a dish-washer. or who only has one shaker and doesn't want to run the dish-washer for one item."
1,"There are so many water bottles out there today that it's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle.  The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today.  You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this!"
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
1,"I am a bit disappointed with this brush. It gets the job done but the bristles seem to splay out easily when using any sort of force. I was able to use this regularly for about three months before deciding the brush was well and truly dead and I needed to find another one. I am now looking around for a new one but if I don't find one to my liking I will probably get another one of these because although it is very short-lived. the grip is comfortable and it does work fairly well while it's still good."
1,"I have white tile in all the bathrooms. and the grout gets stained. Nothing for it but to scrub the grout occasionally. Not my favorite job. but this brush is comfy and the handle is at the right angle.Here is the recipe I use to make grout cleaner. I think it works better than commercial sprays and it's cost-effective:1/2 cup of baking soda1/3 cup of ammonia1/4 cup of white vinegar7 cups of waterPour this into a spray bottle (not one use previously for bleach; I would suggest buying a clean. new bottle at the hardware store.) Spray on. scrub. Do not ever mix with bleach; ammonia and bleach release chlorine gas from the bleach and it is instantly toxic to the lungs and can overpower you quickly."
1,"I am old enough to remember &#34;The Fuller Brush Man&#34;.  After the Korean War. many veterans sold door-to-door for the Fuller Company while they were trying to get back into civilian life.  The &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34; came through our neighborhood several times a year.  Since I was the one who usually opened the door. I got a good dose of his wholesome first impression.  He carried a large well worn leather case.  When he opened it onto our living room floor. a fantastic array of brushes would spill out.  My mother always bought something.I guess OXO somehow fills the gap left by the missing &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34;"
1,"This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand. They call it a 'a grout brush'; not for brushing freshly poured grout (cement). but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium. lime and mold deposits out. Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand. Very satisfied about the results. Because of its narrow brushing head. the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted. It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out. I will reorder another."
1,"The stiff bristles on this OXO grout brush tackle even the toughest soap scum and mildew stains on grout with ease - even older white grout comes out looking nice!  The soft handle makes the chore of cleaning a bit less stressful on your hands. and the length is just perfect for the task of grout cleaning.  I find that spraying some shower cleaner. letting it soak for a few minutes. then tackling it with this grout brush makes my showers/tubs come out looking like new again.  The bristles on this brush have held up the test of time. and have yet to show signs of wear from multiple use.I wouldn't go back to any other type of brush again!"
1,"She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes. so I bought her one of these. When I saw it. I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain."
1,"I always used a dishrag or a sponge for cleaning counter tops.  Then I read a review of this product that mentioned using the brush for counter tops and stainless steel sinks.  I am so glad that this review prompted me to buy this brush.  It really cleans up the counter tops and the stainless sink looks really great after cleaning with this brush.  It is also a great tool for cleaning the interior of the refrigerator.  It has cut down the time required to do that job. and just makes this weekly task more effective in less time.  It's an excellent investment and would have been worth the cost at twice the price."
1,"This brush has a wide rubber grip handle and firm bristles.  What makes it a bit unique is its size - at 11.1' it is nearly a foot long.  You can use it to clean a large area where a smaller brush would make the job tedious. and in some instances to avoid bending as much due to its reach.The bristles are synthetic and fairly heavy gauge.  They can be used to clean corrosive acids and alkalis although this was made for use in bathrooms and kitchens.  I tested it on the shower floor and it's perfect for that type of work.The instructions say this brush can be cleaned in the dishwasher.  With most brushes. the high heat of a dishwasher would cause bristles to fall out."
1,"After getting this brush I thought the overall size of it might be a problem. but proved it wasn't for the things I have used it on. One excellent job it does is cleaning a stainless steel sink. The bristles are long and stiffer making the task less tedious and using about half the time and elbow grease of the way I have been doing it. One thing that could be improved is the handle. It should be just a bit smaller around and have finger notches on the bottom for improved handling. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."
1,"I've used this kit several times while traveling abroad.  The plug is handy. especially in older hotels that have sinks without a sufficient stopper.  My big problem is with the woolite packets.  Nearly every time I travel with these. at least one breaks open and spills all over my stuff.  Not a huge tragedy since it's soap. but a mess and a pain in the neck just the same.  I started packing them in ziplock baggies. so that WHEN not IF one of them bursts. the mess is contained.  The woolite does clean very nicely. though. and I can clean a few days of underthings and socks with one packet."
1,"No one wants to spend vacation time washing clothes in a Laundromat. especially if you are overseas.  Having the laundry done by hotel staff is very expensive but I didn't want to tote dirty clothes around for 17 days!!!  And the fees airlines charge for extra or oversized luggage are ridiculous if you try to take the amount of clothing you need for a long trip.This was recommended by a friend and is the perfect compromise!!!  I love Woolite anyway and the sink stopper is a great addition.  I purchased a travel clothesline and pins and now can wash items as I wish anywhere!!  I will continue buying additional as we travel frequently."
1,"I have used this kit three summers in a row to wash my delicates while traveling abroad. The sink stopper is a wonderful invention and tends to work on most tumba and deep sinks. On very small sinks. it will still work but you may notice it does not hold as tight of a seal. The soap packets are a good size. though I typically only use about half of the packet for six or so undergarments. As long as I fold down the top of the packet. the rest of the Woolite stays inside. The Woolite is easy to wash out and leaves my clothes clean and soft. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone going on a trip who may need to do an emergency load of laundry!"
1,"I bought this as well as the Carson Pendant magnifier. The lenses are both the same size.For starters. the GT 532 took 12 days to receive it! The Carson arrived in two days. Both ordered the same time...I recently had cataract surgery and opted to have my nearsightedness corrected. which left me unable to see anything closer than about 4'. I bought an assortment of reading glasses from Walmart. as well as these two magnifiers. just to get by for the moment.If I had to pick one or the other. the Carson is the winner. It is less bulky. and IMO. allows me to see better. with or without glasses.It has a better case as well. I will keep this for those moments when I forget what I did with the Carson Pendant magnifier.I also bought a lighted. free standing/handheld. 5x Carson FH-25 magnifier at Walmart for $13. I have not found any better product than what Carson has to offer."
1,"The battery was exactly what I needed. it was not outdated and arrived quickly.  I sometimes find it difficult to locate the right button battery when one is needed; seems there is no rhyme or reason given to battery names.  When I open a product to see what is needed. I look up the battery number online and frequently get hits on batteries that do not even come close to resembling the one I have.  I am not sure why button batteries have so many different equivalent names. but I have included some below for this battery in the hopes it will help someone else.A76 equivalent batteries:  1128MP. 1166A. AG13. D76A. G13A. GPA7. GPA76. LR44. LR1154. L1154. PX675A. PX76A. RPX675. S76. V13GA. 357A. RW82. KA. A76. 208-904. SB-F9. G13-A. CA18. CA19. LR44. A-76. 76A"
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
1,"I had purchased (on Amazon) a battery operated remote door bell which I added to my front door.  Needless to say. the little 12 volt battery that came with the doorbell was an unknown brand and didn't last very long.  I could not locate the replacement battery in my local area grocery and drug stores.  I looked on Amazon and sure enough. they had them available!  I was especially pleased the batteries were Energizer. exactly the type I needed. and was a two-pack!  I really do tell my friends that if they can't find something. or if they do and it's too expensive or too far to drive to get it. look on Amazon!"
1,"I thought I was going to get the exact blister pack that was pictured but it wasn't. instead I got the retail single blister packs where the batteries are made in China.  Both work but the twin blister packs are made in the USA and lasts at least 50% longer. next time I'll ask the seller if they are selling this exact blister pack or if they are selling the 2nd rate single retail blister packs.  I won't return it for a few dollars but I would have paid an extra 2 bucks to get the originals with an expiration date printed.  I hope this helps potential buyers of this product."
1,"You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like. but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless. these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries. let's just give this power-packing. very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!"
1,"This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++. would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet. so I am not sure on the quality. I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know . because I did the hard ground-level research. opening the controller. finding the battery. removing the battery. examining the battery. finding the name of the battery. replacing the battery. closing the battery containment area. and so on."
1,"I bought theEnergizer ECR2032 Watch Batteryfor our bathroom scale. and expected it to last a year or more. like the original battery did. However. it is weakening after only a few months. I bought the battery December 2009. but it had a manufacturing date of July 2009. Could it be that the battery was too old? Is this short lifespan a problem with the battery in general. or these batteries in particular? I don't know.At this price. though. I cannot complain too much. Free shipping with Amazon Prime makes this an incredibly good deal. so I ordered another one. Hopefully. it will last a bit longer. The packaging this time is different (not the same as the picture shown). but the battery is still old--February 2010."
1,"I had to get a new battery for my XM radio remote control. This was the size I needed. but I never thought about getting it on Amazon. I went to the drug store and paid over $5.00 for the same battery. When I went home to install it I thought I would just check to see if Amazon had one online. Sure enough. I bought this one and took the one I purchased from the drug store back for a refund. I even told the counter person that I had to return it due to the price. So far the battery works just fine."
1,"I have an old APC UPS that uses this battery. and every 2-3 years. the battery dies.  I always replace it with a genuine APC battery because then I get free mail-in recycling.  I wouldn't know what to do with my old battery otherwise.One way you can tell if it's genuine APC is if it includes instructions on how to send the battery back to APC for recycling.  I purchased my batter from 'Amazon.com LLC'. and it is genuine.  I removed the old battery and put the new one in. and my UPS works great now.  I expect it to last another 2-3 years."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
1,"We have 3 of these. and have been pleased since the beginning (about 3 years ago). Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use (though it takes a bit of getting used to. and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while). We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory. but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss (both dead batteries). There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out. I like this latest itineration best. as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom. One word of caution: my family will not travel without these things. so while I preach 'pack light'. they tote their Sonics everywhere we go. Fortunately. one charge lasts at least a week. so the charging base is only needed on extended trips."
1,"Gimmicky tech stuff drives me crazy. but this product is worth every penny you pay for it.  Although you might be used to scrubbing your teeth (and I admit that can be therapeutic at times). the super-charged foam will actually do a much more thorough job of ridding your teeth of plaque.  My oral hygenist said that use of the Sonicare has made my normally very good-looking gums fabulously heatlhy.  I'm another person that wishes I had had one years ago; it may have helped me prevent the loss of a tooth.My oldest son's orthodontist gave him a Sonicare. because they believe it is the most effective toothbrush for cleaning teeth with braces.  We're buying another for my younger son. as he now has a retainer. The sensation of using it may be a little unusual at first. but you will quickly become used to it.  Believe me. you want this product!"
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
1,"The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners). and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing. but they simply get cleaner. More important. my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless. and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges. and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean. quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However. it's worth it for better dental and gum health."
1,"Excellent product but a little pricy. relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver. then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver. to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades. unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!"
1,"I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then. when trying to get the lather to come out slowly. you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable. but doesn't really burn. The lather. itself. comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not. I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face."
1,"After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product."
1,"I've used an Oral B since 1993. and am on my 3rd one. The first one finally 'burned' out a few years ago. and the 2nd one I somehow left in a motel room. and it conveniently got 'lost' (hope the maid is enjoying it). as when I called that afternoon. 'nothing had been found'...These cannot be beat. Like many other reviewers have said. the dentist's ALWAYS notice the difference when people switch to these.Personally. I always brush on high speed until it beeps. then I switch to low speed. and re-brush. and then go onto my gums and tongue before stopping.A Great Tool. from a Reliable Mfg.. Not to be Beaten! If you've not used one of these. by all means. GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF ONE. NOW!! You'll NEVER regret it! ~operabruin"
1,"B000050FDE: Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush  Am pleased as punch with this dental device. which puts others to shame.  In fact. the soniCare 1126 corpse that it replaced is patiently waiting for proper disposal.  I don't know if toothbrushes have chemicals in them which would pollute the environment if given half a chance.   I don't recall when the Philips soniCare was first used. but even at first brush. it never performed as well for me as the Oral-B.  Different strokes for different folks.   This Gold Box item leaves my mouth feeling super clean each time I use it. and I particularly like the double-head brushes.  Thank you. Amazon. for making this available to me at an 'irreteethable' price."
1,"This is my second electric toothbrush.  I upgraded this time based on a recommendation and have to say it lives up to it's description.  When fully charged - it will take you through an extra long vacation without re-charging. I like the smaller brush that allows you to get around bridge work and between teeth. and that it lets you know when you've done 2 minutes worth (started out determined to always do this --- think I'm down to a minute -- but teeth and gums look and feel good.) Only thing I'd like is a bigger head on the main brush. so that my minute was covering more teeth area."
1,"I charged it for 18 hours as it requested from the get go. Once I start it up. after about every 15-20 seconds. it hiccups for 1 second.  Not bad of a product.  Feels different since I use less toothpaste now (compared to brushing manually).  I feel like a lazy hygienist now. with the lack of desire to brush my own teeth because the feeling of 'Success!' and 'Clean!' isnt' there anymore.  However. I will use this product until it is dead. I also bought it discounted from the amazon gold box.If there were no hiccups. I'd give it a 4. that's the main defect (with mine at least).  I do like the waterproof-ness. but I don't need it since I don't brush in the shower.-MCUpdate: Upping to 4star"
1,"My dentist scolded me for thrashing my gums by brushing too hard and for having too much plaque. He insisted I get the Braun Oral-B. which he said was the best of its kind. I'm glad I did. The design has a soft mode for people with sensitive gums and it has cut down my plaque. far better than had I used a conventional toothbrush. Also the device is easy to use and maintain so I'm confident I'll use it consistently. Finally. I must say my teeth feel far more clean and smooth now. The Braun no doubt will have prevented me from getting some serious dental work."
1,"Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner. and the vibration is enjoyable as well.The battery life is great. however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don't need it to be fully charged to use it.The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.As far as replacement heads. I went with theGeneric Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.). They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.Highly recommend this powered tooth brush."
1,"I had the older version of this from a couple of years back. and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband. and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one. and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.For the price I paid. though. it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions."
1,"I bought this for my husband because he really liked the idea of a self-cleaning razor.  It worked okay for a month or so and then broke.  He sent it in for repair and it came back working properly.  A few months later. it broke again. Again it was fixed.  Props to customer service for this.Since we were already going broke paying for the cleaning solutions. when it broke a third time. we decided it wasn't worth the hassle and bought a different one."
1,"There is a newer offering from braun which I also have. The 7526 razor has been around for several years now and is by far the best one ever made. I have had mine for well over 7 years now and it still works like a champ! I have had to replace the foil and blade twice and the replacements are for sale on amazon. I accidently plugged the cord into only one slot on a power strip and it ruined the power cord so I thought I would 'upgrade' to the newest version. The newer razor did not shave as good as my trusty old one. So I purchased a power cord and I have since packed the new one away in the attic. I'll never give up this razor! It holds a great charge and I am still using the original battery."
1,"I've used Braun razors for over 25 years. and while this model isn't as good as some of the older simpler models. it still works fine. It's great to be able to purchase screens and cutting blocks on Amazon as it's hard to find these in local drug stores. Thanks for providing such great service and just for being there Amazon!By the way. Braun has a great. simple little battery-powered travel shaver that I now use as my main shaver. and then I use my older model for the side trimmer. The little guy is only about $15 and does a great job. and even has its own rotating screen cover. Very neat."
1,"This razor has been pretty crappy to me.  I got it as a Christmas gift about 1 1/2 years ago.  After about 1 year. the foil got a tear in it. so I paid $26 and got the replacement pack (turns out Braun doesn't sell just the foil anymore).  About 6 months after I bought the replcement. the foil got another tear in it.  Now it nicks me every time I use it.  It does a nice job. but it is crap for $30. spend a little extra and get a better razor."
1,"The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers. which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they've got you as a customer. they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's. not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)  I'd try a Norelco or Remington. but I think they're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company (Gillette?).  I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel--or trying a Panasonic."
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
1,"Although the part numbers have changed over the years. this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge. and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)"
1,"I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore. and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit. and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment). and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these. but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer."
1,"Have been using these Braun Clean & Renew Refills for several years now.  They do a good job of helping to clean the razor (after you get rid of the hair debris).  Used to purchase them at various stores especially if I could find them on sale. which was almost never.  I have watched their prices continue to go up & up.  Then one day I found them on Amazon at their Subscribe & Save area at a cheaper price. especially because this package comes with 3 refills which is a money saver.  The only negative comment I will make is that once opened. each refill only last about 30 days -- sure wish Braun could figure out a way to make them last a little longer."
1,"Sure. you can run your shaver head under the faucet to clean out the whiskers.  The alcohol in these cartridges also disinfect your shaver foil and blades.  That's important since you are shaving so close with the Braun you are bound to get unnoticeable micro cuts that might harbor harmful bacteria.  The auto clean function works surprisingly well also.  I tested it by not shaving for three days and then shaved and stuck it on auto clean.  After the cycle was done. I pulled the head and inspected.  Spotless!  That is very impressive.  The Braun engineers deserve kudos for their innovations and making the world's best shaver."
1,"I use this with a Braun 8000 series activator (8585 I think). They are expensive (so is the shaver) but the system does work.  The first one lasted over 5 months. using it every 2 to 3 days on average.  No evaporation loss that I could tell.  You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it but I am not sure that is within warrantee. etc.  I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner. so that made it clean and fresh.  However. when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary.  One thing to note is that you cannot take this on a plane - even if you check luggage.I am sensitive to smells. but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose."
1,"These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not. so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly. then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system."
1,"At first I thought that a self-cleaning razor was gimmicky. but after owning for several years now I think that this function is highly useful and that it keeps the expensive razor and blades in decent condition.  My one complaint about the refills is that because they are alcohol based product. it evaporates. so if you shave infrequently and therefore clean infrequently. the product does not last for very long.  The idea of removing the cartridge and capping is decent. but seems like more of an hassle than it's worth."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
1,"I've been a user of Braun electric shavers for over 5 years. I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean & Renew cartridges have a shorter life span. from about 3 months to less than 2 months. not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point. I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I'm the only one. but so far I give it only 3 stars because of thisBut the Frustrarion Free Pack is great. it greatly reduces the amount of useless cardboard and excess material. Good job there!"
1,"These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use. and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned. not sure why that is. Amazon 'subscribe and save' is a great way to save money on this product. since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience."
1,"I've been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints. The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is. Less cardboard waste than the old packaging. and a better price per cartridge.To make the cartridges last longer. re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use. I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so. and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it's kept capped to prevent evaporation."
1,"The clean and renew system works very well. at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time. and to improve the 'feel' of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month. and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a 'heavy' cleaning.  The system obviously has a 'cost' associated with the refills. but overall. it seems to be worthwhile."
1,"These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old. and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time. so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life. I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy."
1,"This product is used to clean and lubricate your Braun electric razors. They are reasonably priced and last a good amount of time. They have a lemon-alcohol kind of scent to them which I have grown to really like. These really work too. Sometimes when I don't get a chance to order extras and don't clean my razor for a few days I can really feel the difference. Shaving is much more painful because the razor starts to pull your hair more instead of clipping it.Don't get too complacent through. I would still recommend occasionally taking a brush and air can to the razor to get it extra clean."
1,"Braun's cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day. You just have to decide if it's worth paying about $5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you. For me. it is. I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the 'on' button after shaving and walking away. knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it. When I travel. I don't bring the cleaning unit. so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day. which (a) takes a few minutes. and (b) isn't as effective as the cleaning unit. So it's four stars. withholding one star just for the price."
1,"This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads 'low' I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3. but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large. smashed. under-protected box. the 5 stars is for the quality product. convenience. and ease of use. Very easy to insert. use. and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL."
1,"I received a Braun shaver for Xmas last year and looked around for refills to keep the shaver clean.  We even thought of refilling ourselves but after the first try. this was not the ideal solution to using the refills.  We found these at Walmart for a good price but then when those refills were almost gone. I searched for a better price.  The Amazon automatic supply system for refilling these ended up being the best price anywhere and. with free shipping and scheduled shipments. this is one less thing we have to concern ourselves with.  Great product -- excellent value."
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
1,"I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol. but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean. smooth and fresh shave. get this and change timely."
1,"Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each. this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target. Walmart. etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh. lemony. sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each. which helps to increase the value and lower the cost."
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
1,"I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while. long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in. it must have been about two months ago. it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year. not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth."
1,"I bought these for my friend. who needed refills for his Braun shaver system...I told him that he'd be better off getting them through me because I can get it in 2 days with my Prime Membership--and they'd be cheaper than the drugstore prices.I was right about the drugstore price comparison.However--when they didn't show up in 2 days. I called Amazon.  It turns out that the shippers require that these be sent regular-speed (something about Hazardous Materials). so it took 10 days to get here.  You cannot order these with the 2 day shipping.As far as the quality--they are the refills that are designed for the unit. and work just perfectly as expected.The Braun Shaver Systems rule :)  According to my friend. at least ;)"
1,"I've been using my Braun shaver and the refills for almost a year and a half. Like others. I thought the refills might last longer by cleaning my razor every other use. I eventually realized that the refill didn't last any longer. so now I use the cleaning function after each use. I get a fresh shaver for each use and feel as though I'm getting my money's worth from the refills. One note...I always save the cap/top of the refill. If you're planning on being away from your cleaning unit for several days or more. you should cap the refill. You're refill will last longer as you won't lose any fluid to evaporation."
1,"I find that cleaning the Braun shaver in the cleaning base with this solution just a couple of times a week is enough.  If you snap the cap back on the cartridge between uses. you can slow down the evaporation and make the cartridge last at least two months.  The bright blue solution will slowly turn gray from the accumulated whisker debris.  When it gets ugly enough. and when the level of liquid starts to get low from evaporation during use. you'll use your own judgement about when to start a new one."
1,"I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though. buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave."
1,"I've been using a Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges for over two years.  They are worth the money---the shaver is clean and glides over my face for each shave.For what it is worth. I'll add a comment that the Braun 8985 Series 5 shaver itself is one of the best-engineered products I have ever encountered. I'm always finding flaws in electronics. etc.  The Braun seems to defy me!!Some have complained about the price of the cartridges.  They are worth it as I have said.  You can keep the shaver clean by following directions to 'vibrate' the hair clippings out and then use a brush---I've done this on trips of up to one month with great success. but that isn't like using the cleaner mechanism with liquid."
1,"I have the Braun 8585 razor; see my review there for my thoughts on that.I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.Best of all. it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the 'normal' light is on. or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.  That's a bargain to me.  No more brushes or hot running water!  Now if only the razor did a better job..."
1,"I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that)."
1,"Having switched from a long time Braun user to a Norelco Sensotouch 3D I still have my 790cc Braun. When P&G; bought out Braun they discontinued the foil and cutter block with a generic that pales in comparison to Braun Optifoil. I switched to the Norelco and the cleaning system system is a marvel.However I still prefer my old Braun and was lucky enough to have bought extra foils prior to them being phased out. The Braun clean and renew system is still in my opinion the best there is. The solution strips the blades and foil of all gunk. oils and whiskers - it's like a brand new razor every morning.This is a great deal on a 4 pack of refills. Plus if you have a Prime membership you get Free two day shippin to boot. The frustration free packaging is a real plus and cuts down on waste - I choose it whenever it's available."
1,"These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this. I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning. raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call. I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can."
1,"The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more. the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store. and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change)."
1,"Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs. this product may be your solution. By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution. I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps. While the shave isn't as close as premium blades. the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.Two tips: 1) I  recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution. Occasionally. I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving2) Prevent evaporation -- consistently leaving the saver in the stand will help preserve the volatile solution more effectively.  If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal. covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help."
1,"There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday. once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer. it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year."
1,"There's not too much to say about these...they do what they're supposed to!  I clean my razor using the self-cleaning system nearly every day and it really amazes me how clean the razor comes out.  Not only is it clean. but it's lubricated and smells nice.  It truly does feel like you're using a brand new razor every day.  There are lots of reviews on here complaining that the stuff doesn't last long enough. but I find that they last about a month if you use them fairly regularly. and that's about what I'd expect from them.  Sure. you can only use them once a week. seal them in between uses. and make them last a lot longer.  But. I don't find them overpriced and I like that my razor is clean and fresh every day.  It's much faster than thoroughly cleaning the razor yourself. and works better than just using a brush and water."
1,"You open your Braun cleaning station. slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor. it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China. filled with alcohol. coloring. and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?"
1,"I've been using a Braun Syncro shaver system for quite some time. and have always used the Clean & Renew refills to keep my shaver clean. lubricated. and ready to go for the next shave.  Cleaning with these isn't a necessity. but it does take away the chore of having to do it myself.The cost of these. in my opinion. is worth the price for a smooth shave every time without any fuss of having to take the shaver apart to clean it. or having to remember to make sure to lubricate the blades as frequently - plus the lemon scent is a nice added bonus!"
1,"Supposedly this keeps the blades clean and sharp. It sure seems to work. But after about 1-1.5 months. the fluid seems to stop working regardless of how many times you've used it to clean the razor.So plan on buying more than a few of these. For certain it really cleans the razor and so far the blades are only about half as dull as they normally would be. So a big plus. but I really don't like having to buy all these accessories and you can't travel with these as they are flammable. I wonder how just plain alcohol would work instead as it'd be a lot cheaper. Just bring an empty container and fill it with alcohol?I'd like it if these refills weren't flammable so I could take them on the plane and also if they were cheaper. and lasted longer than a month."
1,"I have used this product for years. I don't have a heavy beard. and sometimes I shave in the shower. so I usually don't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine. I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time. but to me this is just a cost of maintenance (like periodically changing the oil in my car). Also. if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product (like when I go away on vacation for a week). I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product."
1,"First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily. you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks"
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
1,"Not much that I can say other than the price of these is much better on Amazon so I get them here. The product works great and keeps my razor in top condition. The only thing I have noticed is that once a razor is a few years old I think the product starts to wear the painting / coating on the plastic. Mine razor has started to discolor a little as well as bubble / peel near the area the cleaner hits. Really this is a non-issue. most razors I have had that cost well over $200 dont even seem to last that long. just figured I would mention it. Not much you can do really. you have to clean the razors and these cartridges are what most require in some form."
1,"I purchased my Bruan shaver with clean system about 8 years ago.  I use to be able to go to Walmart and purchase the refills. but here lately Walmart has not had them in stock.  So I had to go online to find them and of course Amazon did.  Not only was the refills cheaper. but instead of getting a 2 refill pack I was able to get a 3 refill pack cheaper than what Walmart sold with only 2 in their package.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who own a Braun shaver with a cleaning system."
1,"I prefer this ear thermometer to my other one. The need for a lens filter may turn off some buyers. but I like it for the fact that they keep the lens clean and ready to use. The case the thermometer snaps into holds the filters for easy to reach convenience.The thermometer gets accurate readings quickly and easily. It only takes a second. My other ear thermometer took longer and I could never aim it just right. The other one also doesn't have a lens filter. which made it more inconvenient because I always had to make sure it was clean and then hunt down the alcohol to clean it with.This thermometer is tops in my book. I highly recommend it."
1,"I have a number of Homedics products from the full body massager to handheld. to a neck thing and love all of them.  They are great.  While at Goodwill on $1 Thursdays. I picked up this foot massager for $1.  It works great.  All the good and bad stuff about this from the reviews - it vibrates too much. moves all over the floor. etc.  Yes. it does all those.The heat works great.  The vibration works great. though. I would keep the vibration thing on for probably more than 5-10 min.  I feel my whole body vibrating.  Anyway. I keep this under my desk with a big towel under it to keep it from slipping too much.  For $1?  I couldn't even get a $1 burger from McDonald's for less expensive.Great buy and find for me."
1,"For the price. this product isn't that bad. but don't expect too much from it.  The 'massage' basically amounts to it vibrating a lot. which can feel somewhat nice. but not as much as I had expected.  As a runner. I've tried many different foot massagers and this one is on the slightly below average end.  The unit also doesn't put off much heat at all.  You can get more heat from sticking your feet near a light bulb.However. being able to control the product with my toes was fairly nice. and I do use it occasionally.  I just don't think it should have been labeled as a'Pro Ultra.'  There's nothing really 'ultra' about it."
1,"I used to stay in hotels 4 nights of the week when working out of town. Nothing worse for good sleep than noise. a strange place. and jetlag. If you get a smoking room or a stale-smelling room. it can be really be pretty bad. I used to put the television on a non-channel for the white noise (blocks traffic. elevators and voices a bit) and burn scented candles for the odors.The Homedics device is a lot better than burning a candle and having the TV on all night. I love the woodlands sounds and aromatherapy sure works for me (and certainly gets rid of that &quot;hotel&quot; smell as well.)If you travel or know someone who has to be on the road. this is a great thing to take with. And if you have a fussy baby. sometimes it can help (although I lent one recently to a friend with a colicky kid but he still preferred to be in a car. driven round and round and round and....)"
1,"Aleve helps me for my back pain but doesn't seem to help with most common everyday things like headaches.I alternate between Tyenol and Aleve. When one stops working. I switch back to the other. This is just about the same as Tyenol. Aleve may be a little bit better but it is more expensive.I would recommend this if you take Tyenol and it has stopped helping because your body has become adjusted to it. Aleve seems to be harder on the stomach so be sure to take with food.Another reviewer said it helped with her menstrual pains but it doesn't help me with mine. This does help me better than Tyenol with lower back pain."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
1,"The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell. but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator. which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack. which feels like hot lava."
1,"I didn't find that this worked very well for my arthritis (osteo). but it DOES work wonderfully on mosquito bites. especially if you use it on the bites as soon as you notice them. To me. it's worth it's weight in gold for just that reason. I purchasedAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid. Original. with No-Mess Applicator - 4 fl oz. then theAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid. Original - 16 fl ozto refill the bottle. I will purchase again next summer when those pesky critters come back.My husband doesn't like the smell. but I don't mind it at all ... and I don't care since it works!  :D"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
1,"Its pretty good. its a lot like icy hot.  I guess I thought it would be stronger though.  Im using it on a sprained neck thats very painful so I didnt expect it to knock this kind of pain out completely but it helps ease the tension a bit.  My only complaint is it REALLY stinks.  Someone across the room from me at work asked me if I was eating a tunafish sandwich..lol.  It smells like tuna and kinda like rubber a little.  The smell makes me nausea after 3 days of use.  I never want to smell it again if my neck EVER heals..."
1,"Absorbine Jr. is one of best 'old fashioned'. now. sadly little known products on market.I do use several 'legacy' type products still including Absorbine Jr. Cornhusker's LotionPfizer Consumer Healthcare Corn Huskers Lotion 7 Oz&Corn Huskers Heavy Duty Oil-Free Hand Treatment Lotion 7 fl oz (207 ml)and Bag BalmBag Balm Antiseptic. 10 ozWhile not quite as effective on muscle aches to me as some other products like Icy Hot. it is still good and is fantastic on athlete's foot problems (burns like hades. but clears up mine in 2-3 days) and works extremely well on insect bites and plant sticker punctures and irritations.  Kids may howl and complain as it can BURN on broken skin / abrasions. but it works better than most of today's fancy (and expensive) products and does not have an perfumes or fragrances added.  It acts. works and SMELLS like a 'medicine'."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."
1,"The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the product label is misleading.  It's just not for athlete's foot. it's also good for jock itch.  My derm told me that there's no difference between this powder and the one that's labeled &#34;jock itch&#34;.  It's deceiving because the prices are different. whether intentionally or not. it does not matter. consumers shouldn't have to deal with the confusion.  This product gets the job done quickly and easily.  I can't find a better medical powder out there."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist. 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review"
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
1,"I have chronic anemia and am periodically on oxygen. and have developed nearly daily nosebleeds. My hematologist gave me a sample of Ayr because I was in so much pain from the cracking and irritation. I could hardly touch my nose. After a few days using it. my nostrils were actually *flexible* without being too painful again! I still get nosebleeds but if I keep up with using the Ayr as needed. I don't have the burning dryness. it doesn't hurt to touch the sides of my nose and I can blow my nose (believe me. that's an achievement).I purchased theAyr Saline Nasal Gel Moisturizing Swabs With Soothing Aloe. 20-Count Swabsto tuck in my purse when I'm out. since this is Wisconsin and it's drier than a bone here in the winter.This is better than the entire pile of saline-only mists. treatments and sprays I've been advised to use."
1,"As my husband and I have gotten older we have had increasing nasal dryness during the winter.  For a few years we have been using Boroleum at bedtime.  The Boroleum is quite helpful -- but it is viscous and smells awful.  It is basically petrolatum and camphor.  Really do not want to be using it during the day.  My husband discovered this Ayr saline nasal gel -- it is very light. liquid. and unscented.  We find we need to use it several times a day but it has become indispensable.  If I forget to reapply it my nose quickly becomes dry and painful.  It almost doesn't seem possible that this simple and inexpensive salve could work so well.  We have bought so many tubes of this and it is now one of our subscribe and save items.  We are always stocking several tubes as we never want to run out of it."
1,"This was a multi-box deal. The expiration was far enough away in years that I will easily use them all. I suffer from dry bleeding sinuses in the winter. My doctor recommended vasaline; that was a one time nightmare. I tried a generic of this from CVS and liked it. and then found this product for less than the generic. It helps ease the pain of dry nasal passages. help stop the nasal prescription spray from giving me nose bleeds. and coupled with netti pot. saline rinse. and two vaporizers. my nose has been happy and sinus infection free for two months. I will buy more for sure!"
1,"It's so soothing to the insides of my nose. Some types of weather makes my nose very dry and the AYR helps a lot. When my nose get too dry it might bleed when I blow it but because of the AYR it doesn't bleed as often. The only thing is that you will need Q-tips to apply the AYR. You could use your fingers but I wouldn't. You never know what's under them. no matter how much you wash your hands. I would recommend this to any one with this problem."
1,"I have been using Ayr Nasal Gel for the past two years at bed time and have found that it keeps my nasal passages open throughout the night and it has eliminated the stuffiness I had before discovering this product.  I buy it in quantity from Amazon and save substantially from retail pharmacy's.  I can't recommend it more highly. especially after this winter.  Since it has been unseasonably cold making keeping adequate humidity in the home next to impossible with humidifiers and even warm mist vaporizors. Ayr Nasal Gel has provided relief that otherwise would of made my sleeping through the night extremely difficult. A small amount at the bottom of each nostril is all one needs to use and a tube will last for a reasonable time making it a cost effective means verses nasal strips."
1,"If you live in an arid area of the country and are prone to nosebleeds. this is just the ticket. It is a pleasant gel that keeps your nasal tissues from drying out and bleeding. The person I bought this for had massive hemorrhages and was usually far from medical help. Since she started using this. not a single nosebleed. When she can't get to 'the big city' drug stores. I know I can always depend on Amazon to back her up.This product comes in fine spray. gel spray. and gel tubes. I prefer the two later items myself. but even the fine spray or a saline spray helps."
1,"During Utah's dry winters. I experience daily nose bleeds.  I've tried saline nose spray and humidifiers.  After a particulary bad nose bleed lasting almost 24 hours. I researched other treatments.  I had nothing to loose from trying the Ayr gel.  THIS STUFF WORKS!  I haven't had nose bleeds since using the product.  I wish I would have known about it years ago.  But two instructions for best success:1.  Put the get on the tip of the finger (not the bottom) and rub it all around INSIDE the nose & up as high as you can get it. (make sure your fingernail is cut short).2.  Look at your nose in the mirror about an hour later - sometimes there will be white stuff visible.  You want to make sure you don't gross people out.3.  I have to use the product twice daily to prevent all bleeds.This product changed my life; no more daily bleeds!"
1,"In the past our ENT recommended we use Ayr Saline Nasal Gel.  Our ENT said the Ayr gel would keep our noses from getting overly dry.  He said this would help prevent us from getting so many sinus infections.  He also suggested we each use a Neti Pot and saline solution.  As the doctor pointed out. you can keep Ayr gel with you at all times. but you cannot always keep a Neti Pot with you.I don't know why. but we sneeze almost each time we apply the Ayr gel.  The sneezing last for a few seconds and then the sneezing stops.  The Ayr gel moisturizes our nasal cavities. which helps us to have fewer nosebleeds.Amazon and Wal Mart charge the same price for the Ayr gel. but when we go to Wal Mart. they are often out of stock.  I was glad to find it here at Amazon.  When I bought it from Amazon. Amazon had temporarily lowered their price."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel. With Soothing Aloe. 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day. and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists. and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well. delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray. and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)"
1,"I ordered this when I couldn't find the 4-Way saline spray at a decent price.These probably work well for you if you want to use them as drops or dont mind a stream type delivery.I dont like the feel of the stream compared to the mist type so I probably wouldn't order again for that reason.I had trouble with it dripping from my nose as I was squeezing the bottle where as the mist type doesnt do this.Since I dont like leaning my head back to use nasal spray its not a good product for me personally.The product itself is fine overall.I dont like the longer.skinny tip compared to the short.wider.type on the 4-Way.Very good price for six large bottles though."
1,"I suffer from year round allergies with nasal congestion constantly. This saline mist is the best I have tried. It is not drying like the others. The spray bottle is easy to use and gives off a nice mist spray. not alot of fluid just to run back out your nose. I have purchased other spray bottles that were so hateful to use such as the spray hole too small. or the bottle loses it's shape making it hard to squeeze. etc. This mist does the job I need it to to moisten and help clear my nose..sorry gross. Great price here at Amazon also. I'll be buying it again."
1,"I bought these in a pack of 6 using Amazon Prime and considered it a great deal.  I need saline spray after having a septoplasty 4 weeks ago and this saline rinse fits the bill.The shape of the bottle and the nozzle are better engineered than Ocean (in my opinion).  This bottle provides a nice. gentle spray.  Great stuff and very good at moisturizing the mucosa.  Does what it was meant to do.I used this heavily after a septoplasty surgery and also imagine it would be good for those using a CPAP machine dealing with dry noses.  I prefer this over Ocean and some of the other saline sprays because the bottle format is actually nice and delivers a very consistent mist of saline.  The 'fatter' ocean bottles always feel like they get squeezed in the middle and become more difficult to use as the bottle gets emptier.I like this brand the best -- great stuff!"
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
1,"For some years I've had repeated sinus infections.  Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive.  I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray. it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the 'job' for me!"
1,"For someone who always has had troubles with her sinuses. I'm a big fan of nasal sprays.  For some reason. I can not get used to a Netti pot. just the sensation of water makes me gag immediately.  I've tried a lot of sprays. and my past favorite Rhinaris is wonderful. but expensive.  Plus. often it would get a little stale and smelled almost to a point of curdled milk if left unused for a while.  I like Ayr because of a low price on amazon.And here's a great tip. if you take care of the bottle and rinse the tip under hot water after every use [as per directions]. it never gets stale. always fresh smelling. which really means no smell at all.  I usually do 3 sprays in each nostril. which I find does a fine job."
1,".Recently I have been on oxygen most of each day.  Although the oxygen helps the condition for which it was prescribed. it drys my nasal membranes.  So I get frequent nosebleeds.  Sometimes the nosebleeds cut off access to the oxygen.One of my therapists suggested I try Ayr products.  I found that Ayr produces a gel. nose drops. and a mist.  I decided upon the mist.Ayr Saline Nasal Mist is very helpful.  When my nose begins to bleed I spray the mist into my nose and it stops the bleeding.  My doctor explained that the sodium chloride in the mist helps form blood clots.I recommend Ayr Saline Nasal Mist for anyone struggling with nosebleeds."
1,"After my five year old started suffering really bad allergies this spring I used children's Zyrtec. It worked but made my son feel 'weird' and he didn't like it. So I tried Clariton but it did nothing. So I search for something that didn't have side effects and found this. I was drawn to it by the good reviews I found all over the web. Well after 2 days of use my son is allergy free! I can't believe it and I'm so happy! I'm thinking about switching myself from my Rx steroid spray.It's such a happy moment when you find something that works and it safe.If you suffer or know someone that does. please try this product. It rocks!"
1,"What a great little design that fits into your pocket just like a chapstick. No matter how stuffy I get. those Vicks vapors clear me right up allowing me to use my nasal spray to keep the airways clear. There are two things you should definitely avoid with this product. First. you should not over use the inhaler. as it will cause nasal irritation. Second. you should store the inhaler at room temperature because if it gets too hot the vapors will be stronger and also cause nasal irritation. The only other concern is that this product has an ingredient that will show up as an amphetamine on a drug test. So. you should keep the card with you if your boss gives you a drug test. If you follow these guidelines. then you'll see this product is a real lifesaver when you're all stuffed up."
1,"This is a product that is intended to cure/treat an illness/disease. and HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO BE SAFE OR EFFECTIVE BY THE FDA!  *** ALL *** of these foreign medications/foods being sold on Amazon are ILLEGAL ...  Where are you Amazon?  This is a crime.This is a medication made by India (or wherever) for India (or wherever). IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE SOLD IN THE USA!  Wake up people - you have no idea of the conditions in developing countries. no idea of the quality of their source materials. their hygiene. their regulatory enforcement. etc.  I was almost killed by a substituted medication from Mexico.  Don't be an idiot.  If you wouldn't allow a stranger to inject you with a syringe containing an unknown substance. don't eat/inhale unknown substances either. because it is no different than being injected."
1,"Thanks to this little stick. I don't have to fight with my gag reflex due to the horrific smells of my fellow airline passengers who fart up a storm as we fly across the oceans and lands of our vast planet. Out of pure necessity did I buy this product and 10 years later I still never travel without it. I've never used it for anything other than keeping offensive odors away from my nasal passages.I'd rather spray the offenders with Lysol but since that's no longer chic or eco friendly. this little gem works amazingly well. Plus. the Vapo Inhaler is US TSA friendly."
1,"Decongestant pills deliver the drug to your whole body. so they can cause side effects in your whole body. This inhaler delivers the drug straight to your nose. just where you want it. I find these inhalers more effective than pills. much faster. and with fewer side effects.Decongestant pills usually contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine. both of which are stimulants - basically speed. I have tried pseudoephedrine pills and I find they cause insomnia and anxiety. I have not even tried phenylephrine pills. Decongestant pills tend to increase heart rate and blood pressure. and can cause chest pain (angina) in some people. A closely related decongestant. phenylpropanolamine (PPA). was withdrawn from the US market because it caused stroke. However. it should be noted that the stroke victims were generally taking very high doses as a weight-loss aid. they were not using decongestant doses.This inhaler contains a very similar stimulant drug. but the dose is very low and it stays mostly in your nose."
1,"I had a Cold and I couldn't breathe my nose was all stuffed up so I order Vicks Vapor Inhaler. for some reason there are no where to be found where I live. It arrived in just two days. Amazing. with the Vicks Vapors you get instant relief. in just a matter of seconds my nose cleared up real good. One of the best over-the-counter Medicine for Sinus Congestion that really works. I have used it for years. I decided to order another one and for some reason I'm still waiting for it and it's been over a month. I think everyone had the same Idea! ...Thank You D.D."
1,"I sweat if it's hot or cold!!! This is the only thing that works for me!!!!! I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS!!!! Buy this!!! Just DO NOT use after a shower when you have shaved your arm pits it will bun you. At first it does tingle with applications but after a while your skin gets use to it. I did have a rash/burn looking after first application. But using it when I did not just come out of the shower and/or shaving it works best!"
1,"Purchased this for my adult son who has excess sweating; he was so grateful; 'He was like Mom it really does work. thank you!'  Sometimes moms have to research products for adult children as they are where we were years ago. raising young children. working and just don't have the time to get helpful information that will solve their problems.  Anyway. it worked for him...Be sure that whom ever uses this product. that the directions are read carefully as it is not to be used like a deodorant.1. Use at night before bed (do this twice in a row)2. Then use every other nightDon't quote me verbatim. just read the direction for yourself before using. as I'm sure you would like to get the best use from this product.  If it does not work for you see your physician for a stronger version of this product...Good Luck!"
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
1,"I've spent soooooo much money on other products that never helped me :(This actually works!!! I was actually checking in the mirror through out the day to see if I found any sweat & it was completely dry. even after being outside & sweating my underarm area was DrY!!!!! It's watery when putting it on but dries pretty fast & may itch a little at first but it goes away. Trust me if you have embarrassing sweating arm pit stains on your shirt this is Worth it!!! Wish I would have know about it along time ago. But happy to finally find one that keeps me DRY!!! :)"
1,"I saw a TV commercial for this. I thought it wouldn't work so I got it from Walmart so I could easily take it back if it didn't.  IT WORKED.  Now I'm getting it from Amazon after this bottle runs out.It's not that it hides odor any better. it's that it stops wetness better.It's no secret about the aluminum ingredients.  The only thing keeping the mainstream deodorant makers form using the same ingredients is controversy over the effects of aluminum absorption into the system."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
1,"Works but hurts and itches like crazy when you put it on after shaving.  I purchased for wedding as this issue was a big concern for me.  Shaved on Thursday pm in preparation for rehearsal dinner on Friday (since I knew I wouldn't have time to shave on Friday with a huge to-do list). used deodorant on Friday night prior to wedding day.  However. still used another light layer of different kind (a roll-on) over it and had no issues whatsoever the next day.  No. wiping off on his tux or anything.  This was all a HUGE concern of mine too. Everything went perfectly and I didn't have to think about if I smelled or anything at all that day."
1,"1. I was scared that it would sting so badly. and no it's totally bearable and it will go away in a matter of few minutes.2. I once used it all over my body (pits. back. chest). and that was a hot day! And I did sweat a bit. but 90-95% of the sweats were eliminated.NOTE: DON'T use it on large area. not only it will sting really bad the night you apply it. the next day whenever your body trying to sweat it will sting too! BUT if you just use it for underarm alone. everything's fine.3. It lasts for approx. 2-3 days before you'll have to reapply it. Once I used a lot (and by a lot I mean A LOT). it stayed effective for over 5 days!!!4. Instead of rolling it directly to your underarm. you should roll it on your palm. and apply it with your palm so that it won't drip."
1,"If you have profuse sweating problems. thank the lord. because your problems are over. One swath of this under each arm and you can kiss those sweat rings good-bye. Ok. you won't want to do that. but if you have had that problem for as many years as I have. you may actually do it.The bottle says to use only on underarms. I advise that you follow that. However. I put some on my forehead every couple of days to keep those bothersome sweat beads out of my eyes (I wish I had bushy eyebrows). I have noticed an increase in perspiration on other parts of my body. especially while sleeping. but that is a small price to pay for the benefits."
1,"This is an amazing product. I've went through multiple brands. even tried all sorts of Secret. but nothing worked for me. I don't usually sweat unless I'm nervous. After trying Certain Dri Roll-On. I got rid of everything else I had. This thing is amazing. and you do not need to use it daily. Just apply once every 4-6 days depending on how often you need it. I apply it about once a week. It dries quickly and leaves no stains. Be sure NOT to use it after you have shaven or if you have extra sensitive skin as it could irritate. You can use the solid version if you have sensitive skin. Don't forget to get the A.M. Certain Dri as it gives a refreshing smell for the morning."
1,"For years now. I pretty much had to stick to black shirts since I sweat so much.  A quick Google search turned me on to Certain Dri. so I bought some and gave it a whack.  I put it on every night for 3 nights in a row.  Now I only put it on every 2 or 3 nights. and I have been getting great results!  I switched from using your standard antiperspirants. to a combination of this and regular deodorant.  My white undershirts aren't suffering from the nasty yellow pit-stains that normal antiperspirants cause. and I'm able to wear other shirts now without worrying about having wet armpits. We've had a hot May. and so far June here in Detroit...  I've only had minimal issues with sweat. even when it hits the upper 80's and 90's!  This stuff also seems to work well. even when working out or running!"
1,"Finally. a solution to damp pits!  I previously had horrendous sweating. and had to change anti-perspirants almost weekly.  Nothing had ever worked.  Now. I can put this on once a week. and use my regular stuff daily.  It actually works. and I haven't had a single instance of wet pits since I started using it.  I'm blown away that it took me so long to find this!It does sting a bit at night when you apply it. but it is absolutely worth it for the results."
1,"Tried it for a week and it did nothing. Followed the directions exactly...nothing. Tried applying twice a day...nothing. By the third day I was getting severe irritation. By the fourth day I had what looked like abrasive burns under my arms. This was all with following the direction and then. when it didn't work. the suggestions given by other users of the product such as waiting until fully dry after a shower. only applying before bed as per the directions. applying lightly the first time and more the second application the next night. etc. etc. etc.. I didn't get any noticeable reduction in sweating and now I have chafed pits. Moving on to another product."
1,"If you're looking for a product that is both inexpensive and works well. this is it. It does exactly what it says it does.It's sort of a longer term solution. If you put it on at night it'll last for up to 72 hours. but for me usually wears off around the second day. Put it on every night. you'll never have a problem with sweating.This isn't scented. so if you're looking for scented stuff- you can use something else to put on in the mornings. This strictly only stops the sweating. and it's good at doing it."
1,"I love Certain Dri. I'm not sure I could get along in life without it. When I first started using Certain Dri over a decade ago. I would use it every day. Then. I dropped down to using it every other day after maybe two or three weeks. Now. I feel I only need to give my underarms a few swipes once a week. This is incredible because I used to sweat like a beast. I mean. just sitting down without moving around would make my underarms sweat profusely. Gross. I don't worry about that anymore. I do wish that the product worked on hands. though. I haven't had any success trying to get it to work on my hands. However. that's not how the product is marketed. It is just wishful thinking."
1,"Skip all those &#34;clinical strength&#34; products that are sold by big name brands and just buy this!Certain Dri has helped me SO much. I don't think I could live without it! Ever since middle school I've had problems with underarm perspiration. but not anymore. I've been using this for maybe 8 years now. I used to apply it every singe night before bed. but now I use it about once every other week and its still working! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering. even if you haven't shaved your underarms. it's so uncomfortable and itchy!I really can't express how much I love this. Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida. my underarms are still dry!"
1,"I work out fairly often and have a pretty good physique. I like to wherefairly tight shirts. Before I started using Certain Dri. I generally had to where baggier shirts for fear of wetness. Now I can where them as tight as I want. This stuff is awesome. I put it on every 2nd or 3rd night. On occasion it will itch a little if I put to much on. but not near enough for me to stop using it. I certainly don't recommend using it every night. It wasn't meant to be used that often."
1,"I oversweat notoriously and embarrassingly. none of the OTC products quite cut it and make me go out in confidence. and about 70% of them give me rashes to boot. and Certain Dri proved to be a game-changer.1) It does NOT stop underarm sweating altogether. at least for me. but reduces it so dramatically that your underarms end up staying a lot drier than the rest of your body (sth  I def. Prefer)2) Doesn't cause underarm stains if applied correctly* (read sparingly).3) SAFE on oversensitive skin. again. if applied correctly*.*If you're worried you might've overapplied it. simply wait 30 mins after applying. then using a slightly wet tissue/paper towel. wipe the area application. once. This should clean any excess amount away. and don't worry; it will still work."
1,"I am profuse back sweater and had been using Sweatblock pads with great relief.  However. I wanted to find something easier to apply at less cost.  I assumed since the ingredients were the same that Certain Dri would do the trick.  And it has lots of great reviews.  It's been somewhat of a disappointment.  While I can tell it does prevent some sweating. it doesn't keep me dry to the same extent Sweat block did.  I'll try it a little longer because of the price. but it doesn't do the trick as I had hoped."
1,"The temperature hits one degree above 70 and I sweat like a pig. I drink gallons of water a day.  Thankfully my partner doesn't complain.  Her only complaint is body odor. aka pit stench.  Guess what? If there is no sweat there will be no haven for bacteria and hence no odor. This product works very well for me and has been a godsend.  Now my arm pits are always bone dry.  A little too dry actually.  I usually use a gentle skin lotion in place of daily deodorant.  No complaints from me. my partner or my coworkers.That being said this agitates my sensitive skin a little.  Using every other day helps alleviate that. but it's a worthy price to pay to avoid smelling like a dump and having gross stains all over my expensive shirts."
1,"I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I'd jump into a definite conclusion. I've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now. I bought it at a local pharmacy. wasn't cheap. I followed the instructions and I gotta say that it only helped for the first few applications. After that I started having irritation. itching. skin staining. clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working. But that didn't do it. I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant. Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem. Won't buy it again. it's just wasting money."
1,"I've recently started feeling the affects of lactose intolerance and it has put a serious damper on my food experiences. Most of the time I just go without any lactase supplements and risk the small amounts of dairy that comes with the meal. However. when I go for lattes or cheesecake I practically inhale these. They work amazingly quickly. allowing you to take two and just have at it right away.I'm also a bit self conscious about my intolerance. These are individually packed and come in pretty small wrappings. I hide some in my pocket for those days out and if I ever need some I can just turn around and quickly take a few. Very convenient and very effecti...OMGBRB ICE CREAM TRUCK!"
1,"I have severe lactose intolerance (not an allergy. 'just' intolerant) and I usually use the 'Ultra' form of this product. However. since I used to be okay with the 'Original' strength Lactaid. I thought this might be more economical. even if I had to take multiple tablets. I was wrong. For some reason. these tablets just didn't work for me. even when I took 3 or 4 tablets for something that would be managed by a single 'Ultra' tablet.So. if you are really sensitive to dairy products. then you're better off with 'Ultra' Lactaid. rather than 'Original' Lactaid."
1,"The lactaid product is wonderful for anyone that is lactose intolerant. The lactase supplement helps greatly. But go with the tablets. I bought a box of the chewables. and they are terrible. I take them now just because I paid for a box and want to get my money's worth. And once I finish this box. I will always go with the tabs. Granted. ther are more convenient in a place without water... but at the same time. when would you be eating without any liquid to take it down with? Stick to the tabs. you'll be happier."
1,"man! i wish i knew about this when i was younger! I never knew that there were pills about this to help with lactose intolerance... do you guys know how much i suffered bc of milk when i was young? all that diarrhea? it sucked! One day I was like hmmm what if there are pills we can take for lactose intolerance? And there was! I was eager to try it. I'm partly lactose intolerant and It's not that severe. I only get diarrhea when I eat a lot of dairy but ti's not too bad. I take this whenever I drink milk and it does work. I don't get diarrhea like I use to. Now of course this might not work for you bc everyones body response differently to pills."
1,"Lactose intolerance can be very stressful to deal with. Having to decline food. opportunities to eat because you can't digest is embarrassing and annoying. This solves the problem. Take one with your first bite and you can eat dairy products. It says take another after 45 mins but to be safe I would take it 30 mins after if you continue to eat dairy products.I prefer these to the chewables because I can fit a few in my wallet.If you have an empty stomach. be careful when eating lactose containing foods and drinking lots of liquids at the same time. That is the only time I've ever had issues. I took a bite of bagel with cream cheese and a Lactaid and then chugged a bottle of water. needless to say the Lactaid wasn't able to work very well in my empty stomach filled with water and a bit of cream cheese. my stomach was very upset.I drink the Lactaid milk all the time as well - I really like the whole milk.Great products."
1,"I love ice cream & other dairy products but unfortunately. these pills are the only way I can enjoy them.I've also been recently diagnosed w/ extreme iron overload (I guess having steak everyday for lunch & dinner wasn't a good thing :)). So. now I try to drink milk w/ every meal (esp. if meat is involved). At home. it's no problem since I have access to Lactose-free milk. but at restaurants. you don't have that option so Lactaid pills to the rescue!"
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
1,"The National Brand of the best working Lactase Tablets - they get the job done--i.e. preventing embarassing dashes for the nearest lavatory. which can be a pain if you're taking the train. particularly as it tends to be rather drafty in there and on cold mornings any trip where one has to run down a long series of connecting cars just to partially disrobe to read a newspaper and pretend that's all you went there for- which allows you to be comfortable and not have to make the weaving sway-bumping into others -as you fairly leap down the cars to the necessary--only to find it &#34;occupied&#34; - is a good thing to have on hand to use instead- make sure you take it WITH the dairy product - not after and not more than 1 minute before eating ...(heed my advice on this -or- don't say i didn't warn you)."
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
1,"I'm lucky. these are 'cheap' and work great for me; I eat a lot of dairy!I usually eat between one and three with my first bites of dairy. occasionally I've made a mistake and taken after. never have had a problem. knock on wood -funny thing. I live on a dairy farm. and I can drink our raw milk just fine. I need lactaid to eat our aged cheeses and pasteurized milk. I have not tried raw milk ice cream. and our yogurt is fine for me. all yogurt is fine for me ...I'm delighted I can buy this through Amazon. hard to get locally ..."
1,"These Lactaid tablets work well to prevent lactose intolerance induced disasters. The tablets are packaged in a way that is easy to carry around in your bag. pocket or other portable methods.I can finally enjoy foods with dairy again. I suggest taking one right before your first bite of foods with dairy and then having another in the middle of eating dairy if it is a good amount of food or you have been eating for a while. I'm very cautious so I like to be on the safe side I guess.The tablets are composed of lactase. a naturally made enzyme that people with lactose intolerance lack. so there shouldn't be any side effects to taking 'too many' tablets. I would just use common sense and experiment with how many tablets to take when eating various dairy products."
1,"I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead:[...]Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product."
1,"I suffer with very very dry eyes. They sting a lot and I frequently have to put drops in them. Recently the drops just weren't doing it for me anymore.... felt like someone glued my eyelids open and sat me in front of an industrialized heavy duty fan. I had to take frequent naps daily just to help with my stinging dry eyes. I got headaches when I read or stared at the computer too long cause of persistent stinging. For my 'Dry eye syndrome' this is the FIRST and ONLY product that has really helped. My eyes are no longer red. They do not burn. they do not dry out quickly.I still use liquid drops but maybe only once of twice daily and this is only because I am afraid my eyes dry out again.This product is worth the money and I highly recommend it."
1,"This sterile eyewash helps my dogs with his dry eye.  Once a friend was putting it in. I asked why do you do that? she said her eye itches ... so I keep a watch on my Westie. Marco Polo and wipe away his 'goop' and use the wash.  I used to use specific drops for dry eye ... but this has the same effect.It's a large bottle that you just tip. don't squeeze and the drop comes out.  Great price compared to the tiny ones."
1,"I have had problems recently with dry eyes (horribly blood shot eyes at one point). I tried a couple brands of eye drops and another recommended by my eye doctor but none provided any real relief. But. this does - yea! Also. good to have on hand for an emergency. I can't fully open my eyes working to keep the small included eye cup from leaking (which it does anyway). So. I looked into buying a larger eye cup. TheEye Wash Cup 1 Countis perfect. It is curved. slightly smaller. is easier to hold. doesn't bend. and so doesn't leak - a highly recommended addition."
1,"The single-use container version (no preservative) of Thera Tears is the only one that gives my dry eyes relief. and I've been using this product for years.  I've tried other products. which irritate my eyes rather than soothe them.  More important to me than the applicator design is the availability and pricing of the single-use container version.  Unfortunately. Walmart and Target (whose pricing was great at only $8.58 per box) recently stopped selling the boxes of single-use containers in their stores.  So. now I'm researching new sources for best pricing and availability."
1,"I've had severe dry eye for 6+years now. I've used preservative-free thera tears this whole time. They started out with a sturdy little vial that had a resealable tip. Now they've extended the tip with a long 'neck'. When I open the vial it is sometimes still sealed shut. Other times it just squirts everywhere. It's such a waste. Many people are complaining but Advance Research isn't doing a thing about it. I guess we need to log more complaints. E-mail address: info@theratears.com"
1,"I have been using another. more viscous. product for quite some time for dry eye. I tried this and liked it as something to use in between. because it is thin enough. it does not blur my vision. However. it is too thin for much protection now that the heat is on in the house. so I use both. alternating them. I have a bone to pick with the makers. though. They designed the little containers (this is preservative free single containers) with a funny grip that often blocks the liquid from coming out. which is very frustrating and not good for use while driving."
1,"I've used TheraTears for years in these handy vials but recently have not been able to find them in the stores. (The vials are far superior to the bottles that contain preservatives that irritate my eyes.) So I was delighted to find them on Amazon and ordered several boxes. They came without the box. just foil packs of vials thrown into a shipping box. Without the individual box there is no way to verify their expiration date. (I'm guessing they were expired or close to it.). I contacted the seller the same day. They sent me a return label WITHOUT the postage paid. I had to pay close to $7.00 to return them. Don't buy these from the First Aid Company."
1,"We buy these for my 89-year-old mother.  It is so much easier than having a little bottle that she cannot get the top off of.We buy them on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away (besides. the prices are up to 40% higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours. why go anywhere else?)Anyway. these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent."
1,"I bought these for my infant's first trip to Hawaii. I was freaking out about the plane and travel and yada yada... My daughter was 8 months when I used these but she's bigger than the &#34;typical&#34; 8 month old and these fit her ears fine. She was about 19# when we went to give a reference. She didn't have any trouble taking off or landing. These provide an amount of buffering to noise. similar to a regular ear plug. and this helped while we were on a prop (hopper) plane and to the regular noises of flying. I ended up buying 5 pairs to have on hand. Through the round trip of 4 legs. I used all 5 pairs since 1 fell out into the Netherlands of the airplane floor."
1,"I bought these to try out when I am in public since I suffer from near deafness in one ear and hyperacousis in the other (the body tries to compensate for a loss of one of the senses).  I cannot tolerate noisy restaurants and loud venues like Costco.  These are rubbery tubes surrounded by a spiral (screw-like) rubber.  You can place them into your ear canal and twist to seat them well.  The rubber tubes allow air to escape due to changes in air pressure so your ears do not need to pop.  I cannot use them easily since they still do not fit my abnormally narrow ear canals despite the fact that I am an adult.  Still. I can manage to make them stay for a short time by twisting and twisting and it will help if I am exposed to a loud venue and have difficulty tolerating it."
1,"The reason for this is because of the design. Instead of having a tapered curved sleeve style plug similar to the Etymotic ER20s. these have sharp ridges stab into your ear canal. They feel soft to the finger but in actuality apply more pressure on the ear canal than the standard sleeved style ear plug.  There are four ridges that taper in size and they really do push out on the ear canal as you push them into your ear.  It hurts like crazy.  Curved sleeve tapered earplugs. those ones lay against your ear canal and distribute the pressure across more ear canal surface.  With these all the pressure reside along these sharp ridges.I'm very disappointed in these. I thought they were sized for kids (which they are). they  seem to hurt more .  I know earholes differ greatly from person to person. Mine happen to be about 3/16th of an inch in diameter.  I really can't see any child wearing these comfortably. much less an adult with tiny earholes like myself."
1,"I bought FRER pregnancy tests after two years of using the cheaper Wondfu tests on amazon. I loved the wondfu tests and  left excellent feedback but my third batch I got false positives which was. obviously. heartbreaking. I decided to spend more money and buy these tests instead. Well I got my BFP today and confirmed with a digital EPT brand test as well.  I'm 13 DPO and my period was due in 1-2 days. I did test earlier with these pregnancy tests and all tests were negative until today!! I recommend these tests - accurate and quick/clear results."
1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
1,"I used these exclusively with my first two pregnancies.  Fortunately. it did not take us long to get pregnant. so I did not end up forking over more than the price of one package each time.  For my third (and current) pregnancy. in an effort to save money. I bought the Wondfo tests. and purchased the FRER to confirm the positives that I got from the Wondfo.  Wondfo detected the pregnancy at 9 DPO (6 days before my expected period). and did a good job at tracking the subsequent hormone build-up.  I can't imagine spending the money on FRER if it takes repeated attempts to get pregnant. when there are so many cheaper alternatives out there.  That said. I trust FRER's results. which is why I bought it to confirm the Wondfo results.  As I am rating the product itself (and not the price). It gets 5 stars."
1,"I used First Response for all 3 of my pregnancies. They give you accurate results and early. I just found out I am pregnant with my third and I haven't even missed my period yet. I used the First Response ovulation predictor last month and I had a feeling it was a success. I used 2 of these on Friday the 10th and Saturday the 11th. got 2 lines on both. My conception date was May 31st. Granted I know it's early and things can happen. but the point here is that this pregnancy test gave me accurate results and very early. And everyone knows. false positives are almost impossible. I highly recommend these!!"
1,"I ordered these as they are a whole lot cheaper than what they sell in the stores. 3 tests for 11 bucks?! I&#8217;ll take it. They shipped super quick to me which is another plus. The best thing though? I took this test at around 11dpo. Got a faint positive. I went to the lab the next day to get my blood drawn. Came back negative. This test was able to catch a positive before the lab&#8217;s levels could. It was only a qualitative so I don&#8217;t know what exactly my levels were. had to have been lower than 20miu(the lab&#8217;s levels). Had to go back the next week and of course. got a positive. So I&#8217;m pretty impressed with these tests."
1,"It's a shame First Response makes you think your result is accurate 4 days before your period. It is very. VERY rare to be able to get your reading that early.You simply do not have enough hgc in your blood for an at-home test to pick up.From my research. these FRER's are very accurate...but you have to wait til at LEAST 12-14DPO. And this is based on a perfect 28 day cycle with O at CD14research show s Dollar Store tests are also accurate but less sensitive. I would load up on dollar store tests then use these for final proof!Go to fertilityfriend.com and get the proof there that you will probably test negative until about a day before your period."
1,"I was Eager. so I took this test 4 days before we could start saying I'd missed or was late...The faintest of faint lines appeared... a line. is a line and it was a positive line!  My husband was skeptical... so I waited 2 days and took another one... the line was VERY CLEARLY there this time... and we were pregnant. For fun. we tried other leading brands that can detect early... and got a 'Not Pregnant' indicator... so... in my books. First response. is about as FIRST response as you  get... b/c we were infact pregnant :)Goodluck!!!"
1,"I bought this on a whim since I was one day late and my body is like clockwork. Imagine my shock when I took two test and one came out positive and the other negative. I was hyperventilating. We were safe but things happen - condoms are not 100% and I was off my pill due to how ill it made me. I made a doc's appointment for blood work and we found out I was never pregnant.... Happy ending - yes. But we are still traumatized. if this was an accurate test a lot of stress could have been avoided."
1,"First. the instructions to use your first morning urine are bad--it's best to test in the evening. If your cycles vary. there aren't enough tests to ensure you catch your surge. I never got a positive on these. and after testing with Wondfo strips (that provide more tests). I came to realize I ovulate later in my cycle. I never would have realized this on these strips. and I probably would have stuck to my initial fear (that I wasn't ovulating) if I had stayed with this brand."
1,"After using and ovulation test for 4 months as well as BBT charting. we went to the Dr. and when I explained to him that my chart &#34;looked&#34; like I had ovulated but my ovulation kit had never turned. He said it was very apparent that I was ovulating and that I needed to use a better quality ovulation kit. I bought this one over the cheaper ones I had been using and it's true. Personally. I would recommend charting first to get an idea of when to ov. test and then only test on the days that are close. These tests say start on day 10 but I don't ovulate until day 18 usually so I don't even bother now until day 14 in my cycle. If you want to save money. I would recommend using these on your &#34;most likely to Ovulate&#34; days and use the cheap ones on the other days."
1,"The first month of trying to get pregnant I used a more expensive clear blue digital test which didn't work properly as I kept getting errors of all sorts. I then got a cheap drug store brand which apparently didn't work either. I immediately ordered this for my next cycle. it was simple and easy to use. After my first try with it. I'm now 8 weeks pregnant. So what can I say. it works.Update 21/10/2013I'm sure it works!My son is now three years old so my husband and I decided we were ready to try again. So of course I turned to first response again. I bought a pack of these and used it for two cycles. They are pretty good so I was able to stretch it over two cycles. and to my surprise I'm pregnant again using these tests after two months."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
1,"Never got a positive reading with these opks. even though I did with wondfos. and I had a clear rise in BBTs for the four days following the positive reading with wondfo.  These are ridiculously priced compared to wondfos ($2.43 per test versus .40) and didn't work for me!  I would have missed my LH surge if I hadn't also tested with wondfos.  Can't recommend these based on my results.  I highly recommend wondfo opks.Update: Tried using these again this cycle. Clearblue Advanced showed a solid smiley (peak fertility) and wondfo showed a strong positive (test line was darker than the control).  FR still shows a negative. FR apparently isn't very sensitive.  While I think CBs are expensive. they do work far better than FRs for me.  I would have missed 2 LH surges if I'd solely relied on the FRs."
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
1,"I already raved somewhere about these.... they are JUST AMAZING and so far can't seem to find anything betterdon't like pills so these are very thin and compared to regular ones are night and day and they don't smell after like Trojans...you get used to how they look...but again. we disagree on the smell. I don't smell them but my other half does.these are the best we've tried so far! just amazing! ....they're hard to open but totally worth the price and the effort. He loves them. definately the best out there that we've tried. They're not slimy....will order again!"
1,"Pros: I hate condoms. and I love these. They are a little weird when you first open them up. if you don't know what to expect. Honestly. the smell is pleasant. and reminds me of kind of a leathery fruity woodsy smell. They are a little roomy when they get warmed up. which adds to the feeling of there not being anything there. For a while. I was just certain they would break at any moment because I figured an animal membrane couldn't possibly be that strong. but they are super tough. Fill one up with water and you will see what I'm talking about. I went off hormonal birth control a while ago. and have been using these instead. Again. they don't protect against STDs and should not be used by anyone but monogamous couples. Best condoms ever!Con: expensive. but I honestly would pay more for them if I had to."
1,"I cut myself rather nastily at a friend's house and he gave me one of these.  They seal tightly and absorb blood and fluids to allow natural healing.  You just put the bandage on and leave it; no changing dressings.  Although they're expensive on a per-each basis. because you don't change dressings. they may be less expensive than fabric or plastic bandages per injury.  I bought some for car. home. and suitcase. so I'll have one wherever I might need it."
1,"It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack. but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid. I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone. these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages. Flexible Fabric. 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
1,"While there is nothing wrong with the product. I am APPALLED by the magnitude of over-pricing on Band-Aid branded bandages. I am not blaming the retailers. I have also noticed that Band-Aid seems to be &#34;eliminating&#34; competing generic offerings. especially if they are in similarly sized boxes.Right after I received this I found packages of generic bandages with 100 total strips of assorted sizes at Walmart for 88 cents. That's $0.88! I checked several Walmarts BEFORE I ordered Band-Aid. but there was no better generic offerings. it was only AFTER ordering that I found them.Nonetheless. I don't have a &#34;good reason&#34; to return these (oh. I would. if I could. but it's not the seller's fault. so I don't want to make them take losses on S&H;). but I will be avoiding Band-Aid brand with even more resolve now."
1,"I have an irritated spot on my face where my CPAP mask presses too hard. and no matter how I adjust it. it still gouges that spot. Band-Aid Clear Spots help a lot. and I use a fresh one every night. The Clear Spots are also very helpful for little cuts and scrapes where a regular-sized Band-Aid would be overkill. I've been buying these in a local pharmacy. but when I saw the 3-pack (150 total) for only a couple of dollars more than I was paying for one box of 50 at the pharmacy. I was sold.The Clear Spots are a very helpful product at a very reasonable price. and I'm very pleased with the deal."
1,"First of all. let me say that whenever I tried a brand other than 'Band-aid' I was disappointed.  That said. I believe this particular style is the best I have found.  When I was having a lot of trouble with eczema on my right hand. I needed to wear band-aids on two of my fingers. to protect them so they would heal.  All the other bandaids either had fabric that began to unravel almost immediately or the cushion area was too small or the length of the bandaid was too short.  This one is just right. The whole bandaid is 2 7/8 inches long.  The cushion part is a quilted 1 inch by 1 inch square and has a nice thickness to it.  Also. the actual fabric of the bandaid is a sort of rubber-plastic. so it does not unravel and it stays on pretty well.  It is water resistant.  Buy this one for your general use.  You will probably save money in the long run."
1,"I couldn't bring myself to count all 280 bandages in each of the two packs of Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages I ordered. but I did confirm that all stated sizes were in each box in what appears to be the correct distribution. This is a heck of a lot of bandages. but I have two sons and I like to be prepared. I will re-stock our auto and personal first aid kits from these large boxes as needed. I did not carefully compare prices for these. and I suspect a local Costco or BJ's might have better per-bandage prices. but this was a painless way to stock my medicine chest."
1,"First. you don't buy specialized bandages like this very often. I think the last pack lasted well over five years.But these new ones. yikes! The adhesive - able to stick for days (thru showers). the breathe-ability of the flexible and comfortable material. the ability of this tiny bandaid to apply pressure when needed. Latex-free and hypoallergenic (I've had bad reactions to the adhesive in bandaids. not just the latex). This stuff blows away other (more recent) models of bandaids in my medicine cabinet.It reminds me more of surgical tape with a gauze pad fixed to it. Except my surgical tape isn't this quality.Where can I find this stuff in other sizes?"
1,"With our large family and all of us doing lots of sports - ok. the kids do sports and I'm just a klutz - I like to keep a large assortment of bandages in the medicine cabinet.  I like this huge 280 count box because it has some of every size in one place.  Having a separate box for each type of bandage takes a lot of space.  Most of these are the plastic kind. although it does contain some of the fabric kind. We don't use many of the little tiny square ones. but they're nice to have on hand for blisters or small cuts.  The biggest ones are perfect for knee or elbow scrapes.  The fabric ones are perfect for fingers. since the bandage is tougher.Bandaid bandages stay put on the injury. unlike some of the cheaper ones I've bought.  Every medicine cabinet should have one of these boxes. ready for any emergency."
1,"I gave this product one star because I didn't even have the chance to really test it's effectiveness because it started coming off the same day I put it on. I followed all the directions. washed and dried the affected area. etc. etc. My blister was on my hand. while most other people seem to have them on their feet from running.The directions clearly show that it can be applied to your hand (actually their illustration showed the product being applied in the exact same spot I had mine). Well it stayed on for a while until I had to wash my hands and then it just started peeling off.The product says it can get wet and is made to stay on. Don't get me started on the cost of these either. Regardless of which option you chose. your paying at least 80 cents per cushion. That's a rip off. You could purchase 40 band aids for that price. use some neosporin and replace them each day. Much cheaper.Would not recommend."
1,"We never seem to have Bandaids around when we needed them so I ordered these. They arrived quickly and contain lots and lots of Bandaids. They are of the no frills variety. meaning your traditional old-school Bandaid. No flexible fiber bands or anything. There are tons of bandaids in here. All sizes and shapes. Great if you have kids who often get hurt. or if you are accident prone. You'll always have a Bandaid in the house with this pack.Pros: Cheap.Lots and lots of Bandaids. all sizes and shapes.Cons: Very basic band-aids. not very sticky."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
1,"I bought these after having a tooth pulled that would not stop bleeding. I'm by no means an expert on gauze pads so I won't speak to quality etc. I bought the smallest size which was 2x2 inches. If you are having a tooth pulled and want to have some on hand I can recommend these. I did find I had to cut them half in order not cause my 'gag' reflex to come into play. This may have been because of all the stuff the oral surgeon had stuffed into my mouth and my brain may have had it!  Anyhow. these fit nicely into the back of your mouth when cut in half. I'm sure since I have three grandchildren under 7 that the ones I didn't use will come in handy at some point too!"
1,"With my washing machine not working. I've been doing a lot of hand laundering. as well as washing dishes. (no dish washer either) My hands with dry Winter air and harsh indoor heating have become crinkled. cracked and rough.I have a box of hand lotiona and creams and last evening applied this one just before going to bed.It helped very much.Upon awakening this morning. I nearly forgot how dry and parched they had been because they feel so nice and soft.I'll be using this every night before bed until my skin heals.Wonderful product for chapped. cracked hands."
1,"A family member had been suffering with lips so severely chapped that they would crack and bleed on a daily basis - the bottom lip looked like it was splitting in two.  This went on for several months.  After reading about this product. I purchased a tube:  within 24 hours. the pain was gone and the skin was starting to heal over.  Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed.  To say that we are shocked is an understatement. particularly when we read the ingredients. which appear to be primarily mineral oil and petroleum jelly.  This is a miracle in a tube. and we are not going to use any other chapped lip products.  Highly recommend this."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
1,"Folks. the 'active ingredient' in this crap is Petrolatum - basically. that's Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.  And this junk contains 41% of it.  Regular Vasoline Petroleum Jelly contains 100%.  At less than 1/3 the price.  So if you want to spent $6.00 on this vs. $1.50 on a Vasoline. please don't let me stop you. but I'm simply telling you basic science.  The 'inactive' ingredients include mineral oil and glycerin.This concoction is why pharmaceutical companies are despised around the world.  Take $0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly. throw in $0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin. and tout it as 'Advanced Therapy'.It's B.S. folks - pure and simple.  Junk.Save yourselves some money and do yourselves a favor - but the cheapest Petroleum Jelly you can find; Vaseline or store brand."
1,"I bought this product because I saw that there were 62 5 star reviews and almost no bad ones. A mistake. I should have read the ingredients more carefully before buying. I should have read them at all.As soon as I squeezed some out of the tube I realized it was mostly petroleum jelly. I looked at the ingredients and. sure enough. active ingredient was 41% petrolatum.THAT'S VASELINE!So. if you want greasy hands and nothing else works. maybe this is for you. But I don't. and am somewhat disappointed I didn't read the description more carefully and bought based on all the great reviews. Caveat Emptor."
1,"I discovered Aquaphor when a dear friend went on Accutane. She was in misery because her lips were so dry. Her doctor gave her some Aquaphor samples. I had thought it was only for body skin but I was very wrong. This thick. rich product soothed her lips and the dryness and cracking were gone within a day.I picked up a tube and found it has a many uses. In addition to softening lips (which I use in rotation with another favorite Carmex) Aquaphor can be used on dry knees. elbows and heels. A tiny bit works well as an eye moisturizer and it also softens cuticles.Great product for a little price!"
1,"I have dry skin and when the weather gets dry and cold. my skin keeps coming off like a snake (I think it's a common problem that many people have). Before I used Olay Moisturizer + Sun Block and it worked. However. for some reasons. it stopped working for me. My doctor recommend this to me. I tried it and it worked really well. My skin stays moisturized for the whole day. The best thing about this product is I don't have to use it everyday. I apply it on my face in the morning. wash it off by the afternoon. and my skin stays moisturize for the next 3-5 days. The only draw back is the product is waxy. When I apply it on my face. it looks like I just cover it with oil. Yes. shine. oily looking. However. if you don't care too much about your appearance. it is a perfect solution for your dry skin. Oh. did I mention that the price is very reasonable?"
1,"Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I've ever used!  I'm on Retin-A. and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I'm dealing with right now and how you're not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I've used the other $100 jars of worthlessness. and believe me. this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However. some things you do need to consider before buying:This is quite greasy. therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding's....It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I'm not complaining."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
1,"I have used this for years to combat dry skin on my face. Here is why I like it:1. It goes on clear and works very effectively to moisturize dry skin.2. It penetrates quickly. so I can wipe it off in a couple of minutes in order to avoid having a &#34;shiny&#34; looking face. but still have moisturized skin.3. It is more soothing and less greasy than vaseline.4. Unlike various facial moisturizers. it is fragrance free. so you don't have any smell after using this.5. This tube is a convenient size for travel and also to keep in the office.Bottom line: I have tried countless ointments over the years because I have always had dry skin. and this is the best one that I have found.Shop for price. I buy this for less at my local CVS than the price on Amazon."
1,"I suffer from HS and bought it for this. This is great for itches as well. It numbs the area so you can forget about it. i.e. mosquito bite. etc. I also use it for my edges. After I got my hair braided it was tight and annoying and I am using it for a few days until my hair loosens a bit. I will also use if for my eyebrows when I pluck. Apply first. leave for a few minutes. then wipe. The product should have numbed the area long enough and makes tweezing/waxing less painful. I will buy many times."
1,"After years of having toe nails that grow oddly while at the same time toe nails that would turn almost black . I started using this medication. Even after a just-a few weeks I have noticed a great change and would not be without it. My toes nails re now growing with a distinctive clear color rather than black and they are beginning to take a normal shape instead of the one-fourth inch thick toe nail I used to have. It is still too early to tell if the medication is going to completely clear up the fungi. however it appears it is working quite well."
1,"I used a different product that is Acetone based so it dried & disappeared. leaving just the medicine in place. I like it still but thought a different product might be good so the fungus doesn't get immune to it. As you might know. there is NO cure for nail fungus. not even by prescription. you can only control it.  This product here is an oil. think what it can do to your socks or if any of it gets on carpeting etc. Also my nails started getting a dark cast to the top of the nails where this was applied. This product is no good."
1,"If your going to try it and it has a applicator brush in it too . I bought the pen and it lasted about 6 weeks . Tea tree oil is really the best stuff . I am making some progress using both and planning to try kerasil or the vics vapo rub next if this doesn't clear it up after 6 months . It cleaned my little toes quick but my big toes just won't clear up . They look better but stay yellow - not gross anymore but slight greenish yellow . Getting old is no fun and either is using a dirty shower in a truck stop . Been paying for one slip in doing that for 25 years now but I treat it daily and know I won't do the same to someone else ."
1,"This is the only thing I've used that has helped the fungal infection of my big toenail (which I've had for 5 or 6 years). I use it twice a day in conjunction with Fungisoap and within a few weeks I saw improvement. My nail is no longer thick and dark. and while the infection is visibly still present. it looks much better than it did a month or two ago. I cut my nail down as far as I can and keep it filed down so I can apply this liquid under the nail as well. Right now it looks like my nail may fall off (sorry if this is TMI). but I'm hoping like others here that will mean I can continue to use this stuff on the skin under my nail. I'll update this review as time goes by."
1,"My nails and cuticles have been so dry and were looking just awful!  Some peeling of nails. but don't think it was fungus~just cold winter and using bleach to clean while at my daughter's house with no gloves.  Ran across a bottle of this stuff while looking for nail polish. remembered how it had cleared up a toe fungus years ago. and decided to try it on my nails. just to see if it would help.  WOWOWOWOWOW! You wouldn't believe the change in my cuticles and nails in the last 3 days!  Whatever is in this stuff is just really great for dry. peeling nails. with or without fungus. dry cuticles. and who knows what else! I may try it on other skin issues now.  GREAT stuff!"
1,"Bought this and Tea Tree Ultimates - Funga Soap for my wife. Both her big toes were gross and cloudy and cracking. Why it doesn't bother her more...I don't know. but I took it upon myself to buy her these two products.She started using them. and within a week or two...both nails fell out. It was super nasty...but I'm guessing both nails were so unhealthy. they probably would have come out regardless.Over the last 6 months. they've been growing back. One of them looks great. but the other is cloudy. Why? Because she doesn't use the stuff I bought her. :)I can't say what the two products do individually...because she only used them together. For the price though. it's worth some of the more expensive options at the doctors office. But you have to be disciplined and actually put the stuff on!"
1,"Probably one of the world's best inventions. Vaseline.  But. this tube is just fantastic for babies.  We bought these for our newborn and it's just so much easier to use when you're putting it on the baby's belly button.  Plus. it's best for preventing diaper rash than anything else out there on the market.  When your hands are dry from washing them after EVERYTHING you do with the baby. the Vaseline comes to the rescue. This tube is a marvelous invention and the best sanitary-wise to use for a baby.  I keep one in my purse for my dry hands too.  Love this invention!"
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
1,"Every year my Lab (Maggie) gets some kind of contact dermatitis or allergy on her Neck. Not sure from what. This year I purchased the BFI and the Columbia Powder. I do remember as a kid I think my parents used the BFI. At that time it was in a little metal can. Anyway  I use them both and they worked great. Just can't say which one works best. They probably both work the same but I would lean towards the BFI because I remember it as a kid."
1,"This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy.  Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day.  I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I don't add more than the water required in the directions; a watery orange taste can be terrible so don't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I don't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me.  This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis."
1,"What can I say? Metemucil works. not only to prevent constipation but also to prevent the runs. Our GI doc actually prescribed it years ago to slow down the works.If you check the labels. Metamucil has more soluble fiber that any other supplement I could find. Cheaper too.Since we use one cannister almost monthly the subscribe & save is great. If you drink it in about 10 oz. water quickly. it does not get mushy. Just don't let it sit for any length of time.It is GF. has no MSG or related products or aspartates."
1,"This product contains way too much sugar for me. I just compared Metamucil (48.2 Oz Container) to Benefiber (18.7 Oz Container). and found the following:With Metamucil you get 114 servings per container.Serving Size: 12g (One rounded Tbsp)Calories Per Serving: 45Total Carb: 12gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 2gSugars: 9gIron: 0.8mgSodium: 5mgPotassium: 30With Benefiber you get 115 servings per container.Serving Size: 4.6g (Two Tsp)Calories Per Serving: 15Sodium: 0gTotal Carb: 4gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 3gSugar: 0gMetamucil is tasty but it gets too thick to drink if not consumed immediately. Benefiber is a little more expensive. but at least I'm not paying for sugar and putting on weight from the empty calories.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
1,"I'm glad that amazon carries this product because I can't find it in my area anymore. I've tried many pre-shave conditioners thru the years but this works best for me. I don't really like buying 12 of these at a time but the price is right and even buying 12 is still cheaper than buying just one of some of the other products I have tried. I will share this with my son and son-in-law who both use this product too. Thanks Amazon for keeping this available to us!"
1,"I have been buying this lotion for 6 years from my grocery store. Usually they cost $3-$4 each but now none of my grocery stores carry this anymore. I got this 12 pack for $26 and free shipping and you can't beat that anywhere. This lotion makes it so easy to use my electric shaver without any irritation and it glides with a close shave. Also you need next to very little after shave after using this because it has lotion built in and has a very subtle scent you can use a different after shave lotion or cologne without the 2 scents clashing."
1,"After using all types of eyebrow grooming wax to hold down my unruly brows. I had almost given up until I found this gem of a product.  My current eyebrow wax was a little too hard and unfortunately would yank out a few hairs with it.  In a last ditch attempt. I tried the clubman moustache wax in neutral.  Keep in mind that my eyebrow hairs are VERY unruly (and yes. I am a lady)and finding something that really works and has staying power had been difficult until now.  You only need the smallest amount on each brow because the product is very concentrated.  My eyebrow hairs stay in place all day and look better than they ever have.  I also like the fact that it dries clear and that there is no build up.  It also doesn't dry out my skin like other products.  Definitely a keeper!"
1,"I got this a few days ago and each day my handlebar looks better. It's like my mustache is learning to form a curl on both sides. This goes on soft and easy with very little work and then after about 15 to 30 seconds it sets and you have a very firm but still pliable hold. It has a very pleasant fresh scent that reminds me of grapefruit. It washes out very easily my one complaint is that the neutral shows up as white on my red stache and makes me look like i'm greying or have dried boogers unless I am very judicious in my use of the product. So until I find something else this is my go to with a light touch."
1,"This was actually the boyfriend's purchase since he wanted to try black (his hair is naturally black) instead of the clear which is all he can find in stores around here.His opinion was that clear is a lot better even though you have to work it in to make sure it doesn't show up because the black is too messy (i.e. it's black and tends to get on everything.)It'd probably be good if you wanted to darken your moustache/beard though.Aside from that he likes Clubman's and I have to say it makes his beard look much nicer...keeps his beard in control."
1,"The odor was too strong for me. It was a fruity sweet smell but it wasn't working for me.  I had to wash my moustache within five minutes because I couldn't stand it.Also the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it.  It was looking bad to me visually.It did hold the hairs into place for the brief time I used it.The only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush. Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection."
1,"My beard always grew in patchy and I tried a ton of things to fill it out. This wax is the best by far.It's good and thick. but you can add water if you'd like to thin it out. It has a tiny brush for pinpoint accuracy. It tends to get on your fingers. then anything you touch. but you can't blame black wax for that. You can only blame mother nature. And if you got a problem with mother nature. you got a problem with me.It can rub off. but a holding spray or spritzer can help it hold. My beard looks naturally fuller and i've gotten a ton of compliments from other beard enthusiasts."
1,"this wax is awesome. its soft and easy to apply it drys on clear and will hold my mustache for a good 10-15 hours without me having the fix it.only complaints are that sometimes it irritates my skin or drys it out. and the container it is in normally ends up getting damaged or a hole in it since its metal and will eventually just get a hole in it from squeezing or folding the tube. ussually happens to me when the tube is 50-75% gone but it will dry out inside the tube fast when it happens. Ive been through about 4 of these in a year and it happened to all of them."
1,"I've been alarmed by the reviews on various sellers' sites saying they had ordered cylindrical and received tapered. I ordered these in August and did receive cylindrical brush tips. as pictured. The wires are pretty weak. and easily bent. but that's unavoidable if it's going to fit into tight spaces. They're supposed to be changed weekly. and I can generally get a week's worth of use out of one. despite having some teeth that are both very close. and slightly crooked. so it's a guessing game inserting the wire at just the correct angle to slide right in.I use a Proxabrush with the conical tip at one end for wide spaces. and the cylindrical one at the other end."
1,"I use these with the Oral B interdental holder that my hygienist gave me. She originally gave me some of the WIDE interdental brushes which worked fine for larger gaps. but the #414 'Tight' works for more of my gaps. There are still a lot of spaces that these will not fit. so I recommend using regular floss as well as a Waterpik in conjunction with these interdental brushes. My normal routine is to floss. use the interdental in most spaces. then use a Waterpik. followed by an Oral B powered brush.Overall: 5/5 stars. as advertised - may not fit in the tightest gaps. but works for 90% of my teeth. I'd probably go with Moderate for a better fit in the larger gaps."
1,"I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal. and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums. and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit. it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea. but the others worked much. much better for me.  I would not recommend these."
1,"The 'tight' proxabrush refills are just what I wanted and ordered. They get into most of the small between teeth gaps that the larger brushes do not.My only problems with the tight ones is that the wire is so fine they don't last very long (and bend too easily) and there are still some teeth that tight are still too big to get between.I also ordered 'wide' only because I couldn't find 'extra-wide' on Amazon.For both sizes. the brushes eventually wear out - getting either shorter or come off the wire. but each one lasts at least a week for my use (daily)."
1,"I hate flossing but I do it anyway.  I actually should say. I &#34;hated&#34; flossing.  The time it takes annoys me and it seems like my gums still bled everytime anyway.  Now I floss. use this to stimulate my gums and then brush.  This tool is awesome.  My gums like it.  They aren't bleeding now and I get more out with this thing because it goes around the whole tooth not just in between.  I really like it a lot enough to use it every day. I actually look forward to using it.  My teeth feel really clean now."
1,"I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it's ease in purchasing. I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis. You run the rubber tip (point) between your teeth and gum line. The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove. The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth. Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results. When the rubber tip starts to curl. then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago. I also use daily a water pick as well. as prescribed also."
1,"We've used these for years but most recently. they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist. he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well."
1,"This is VERY durable; it hasn't broken in the months I've had it. (I forgot to write a review until now...).I had wanted a gum stimulator for quite some time. and I decided to buy this one. it was inexpensive. and it looked legit. Great product for a great price. I am a 100% pleased customer. When this one gets old or worn out (it still hasn't at all though!). I will definitely be purchasing this exact one again. (maybe from a drugstore. to avoid shipping costs. But still this product!)I also bought refills (replacement rubber tips) for when the tip gets worn.Note: For a while I was wondering why the rubber tip felt so hard and stiff... and nothing on the package said that you have to run it under hot water to soften it up before uses.. that. or I just didn't see it. Then again. it is sorta logical... but yeah. Run it under hot water to soften it. :D"
1,"With an angled head like a dental probe. the rubber tipped GUM Stimulator is a handy tool for stimulating the gums. and removing plaque from hard to get to areas. like behind the back teeth.  The sharp rubber tip works well in between teeth. and also along the gumline.  While it is recommended that the tip be heated before use to soften the rubber. it probably isn't necessary.  If the tip wears out or breaks. replacement tips are available.Controlling plaque is a lifelong challenge for most of us. and this is a very helpful tool in the battle.  Check your local drugstore for a better deal."
1,"The G-U-M stimulators do exactly what they should do - get the bad stuff out and away from around your teeth.  Even after brushing long and thoroughly. there is still stuff left under the gum rims. The G-U-M Stimulator tip removes the bad stuff without hurting your gums.The difficult part about the G-U-M stimlators is getting the rubber tips onto the metal handle.  It takes a lot of hand strength.  Moistening the tip with hot water helps. but it still takes a lot of hand strength.  The other downside is that a single stimulator is good for only about 3 or 4 uses - then the tip begins to break.  Time to wrestle a new tip onto the handle."
1,"Not much to say here. but I like when products I'm looking at have reviews.These are durable. good. effective... Basically. they are exactly what you want when you are looking for replacement tips for your gum stimulator. Also. they are inexpensive. I will definitely buy these again when I need more!Note: They may seem stiff at first. but you are supposed to run them under hot water to soften them before use. It took me a while to figure that out. I think it's on the package. but I don't remember.Anyways. good product. 5 stars!"
1,"These are great travel toothbrushes and I recommend them.  However; at the time I was updating my emergency kit and wanted to add a new compact toothbrush.  Not to take away from this great product - I found a better one right here on Amazon called the Wisp tooth brush.  They are one time use toothbrushes that come with toothpaste attached and weigh nothing.  So. if your traveling overseas or somewhere where ounces don't count these are great and compact enough.If ounces count check out the Wisp toothbrushes you'll be glad you did.  I am now happy I have both and I recommend both for different uses."
1,"I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.What's wrong with it?1- the threader part used to be longer & stiffer. thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework. especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth. Now it's short. flimsy. & bends so easily. it doesn't do the job it was designed to accomplish2- the floss portion used to be much thicker. fluffier & stronger. Now it is a mere shadow of itself. and as such is totally useless. And. it shreds!I had read the poor reviews. and always try to keep an open mind. Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on.  This stuff is worthless. Do not waste your money. Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution."
1,"This is IMHO the best floss you can get with or without braces. It takes some practice. and when you get it. you will see how effective this floss is. The fabric works very well at removing an incredible amount of gunk b/w your teeth. It will shred if you get it caught on your braces or if you snag it on something but again it takes practice to avoid doing that. I havent been able to find this stuff in stores around my home. usually. its the only hanger thats empty. Annoying so I have had to buy online."
1,"I had to try this after reading its description.  My denture comfort liner had come off (as my orthodontist said it would) and I couldn't afford an airline trip to have him reline my upper denture.  I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me. and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable.  Even after I faithfully followed the instructions. I got poor results.  It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours...and. much to my surprise. the stuff came off in a gooey mass.  I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures--it's an effort. just getting the cream out of the tube--hoping that exposure to air might mean better results. but that didn't work either."
1,"This may be the world's worst product. It is hard to work with. even when following the directions carefully. Once in place. it squishes out of your dentures all over the outside. No matter how much you clean it off. moer of it squishes right back out again. In addition. even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more. when the denture is removed. the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth; not in the denture. No doubt. this manufacture was trying to make a product to help people but it does not work."
1,"This is a weird sort of &#34;goo&#34; that comes out malleable like fairly hard putty. It can be molded. but it's a little too hard to mold to the gums well enough. I left it in for a few days and it was VERY hard to remove! It seems to have a slightly glue-like consistency. I can see it being perhaps useful in &#34;fine-tuning&#34; a temporary reline kit. but DON'T confuse it with actual denture adhesive. It doesn't stick to the gums AT ALL."
1,"'Cushion Grip' is a paste that is formulated to hold loose dentures in place for a long time - several days in fact (not that it is recommended to keep a denture in for days on end!).  Said another way. the paste has properties that allow it to remain retentive for several days.  I have recommended it to some of my denture patients (if they have a properly made denture. yet still need added retention).If you have to use excessive amounts of paste to keep a denture in. then the denture probably needs to be remade or relined (or perhaps an implant supported denture should be considered in cases of severe bone loss).konedog"
1,"First off I would not call this adhesive. It works good to use it at night before bed. I put in warm water till soft. roll it like a worm and sit it in the denture. Close my mouth till comfortable not tight.  It feels warm at first  and I try not to clamp my teeth or move my mouth much. In the morning dentures come right out not stuck at all. If product overflowed above denture I gently trim it. After that I use my regular adhesive and dentures fit great. You take them out wash and put back in with your reg adhesive for four or five days till the Cushion Grip starts coming loose.  Soak dentures in warm water and you can work the old Cushion Grip loose in one piece. I would only recommend for people that have really loose dentures as a temp fix.  It does need to be used with reg adhesive because Cushion Grip is not an true adhesive. just builds up and fills in dentures."
1,"Nice product but after many trials. opted for another adhesive product.  Although CUSHION GRIP is  a good product. it takes second place. in my opinion. to EFFERGRIP.  Why?  Well. CUSHION grip requires placing tube in hot water for about 5 or so minutes and then applying to dentures.  Besides. it costs a lot more than the EFFERGRIP.  For some folks. this could be seen as okay because CUSHION GRIP doesn't need to be applied every day but maybe every 3-5 days while EFFERGRIP requires daily application.All in all. the ease of use of EFFERGRIP makes it the top choice. in my humble opinion."
1,"'Sea Bond' denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste. gel. or powder. the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist. I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue. In this case. the Sea Bond pad fills in in the gap and helps seal the denture. I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this. However. dentures are not cheap and this product serves as a stop-gap measure until a new denture or reline can be done.Jim 'Konedog' Koenig. DDS"
1,"After a friend burned some gum tissue on some overheated coffee. a dentist recommended this product. both for its healing properties and overall cleansing ability.  As listed above. this product is recommended (by 'dental professionals!')for canker sores. gum irritations. denture & mouth sores. orthodontic irritations. mouth burns. and cheek bites (I'm not sure what the latter is).  I tried a little. and the taste was pleasant and the liquid nonirritating.  There is a mild foaming action as well.  Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional."
1,"This is the regular Plax (not a knock off product). With the free shipping and no tax. it beat the prices I can get at the local stores even on sales. However. it still isn't very cheap. Maybe if you get lucky with a sale you can beat the price at retail.I use a little measure graduated cylinder (rectangle actually) from a water test kit to measure out about 7ml when I use this stuff. If you swig it out of the bottle you'll find you probably use 10-20 ml per rinse. All you really need is 6 to 7 ml. and at the prices for this. you are wise to make yourself measure it out. You might as well anyway to not waste..."
1,"I like always have to take good care of my own teeth.I did a little research like I always do.and found I wanted to try this mouthwash. however it is hard to find this available at any store :(But after searching and doing my homework I found it at: www.drugstore.com/A store I highly recommend.I do all my shopping for items that you would so at that store online.Getting back to the mouthwash. I ordered it because I had heard so many good things about it. things not all mouthwashes do. you see therefore not all are equal.It has a nice taste. I hate the other ones that make you feel like a rocket went off in your mouth and is so strong and zesty!This one is pleasant. and nice.I suggest you try this. I just wish it was more available. I worry they will discontinue it. So you might want stock up on this if you like it. Yes &#34;note to self&#34;"
1,"okay i was very skeptical about this at first. but after i tried it. it seemed to help me cure gingivitis! and plus it softens up tartar buildup so you are actually brushing away hard tartar without the dentists need!Amazing ive been using this for about a week now and 1 week ago i had a small tartar formation and today its reduced by a large percentage!i freaking love Plax this will put those cheapskate dentists out of business!Listerine and Crest despise products that actually help the teeth get rid of plaque and tartarall Crest and Listerine can do is just give you a 'tartar and plaque fighting solution' but Plax actually removes alot of plaque buildup and dissolves tartarof course it doesnt say it dissolves tartar on the product but you have to use logic. tartar comes from fossilized plaque or plaque builduponce you get rid of plaque you have raw access to tartar if you have raw access to tartar its only a matter of time until its all gone5 stars.oh its a prebrush rinse use it before you brush"
1,"I've tried them all.  Natural Ice is one of the best. and MUCH cheaper than many others.  The cherry flavor fades quickly so you're NOT tempted to bite or lick at your lips.  It goes on smoothly which is important when your lips are chapped and dry.  Your lips respond almost immediately.  There is a slight tingling when you put it on. which is the medication going to work.  I bought one dozen in January. and I bought 2 more today. That fact alone says a lot.Caution: Be careful if you get it on your fingers not to rub at your eyes.  It will sting."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
1,"I have used this product (lip balm)for a long time. and I am extremely satisfied with it. because it has SPF15 and menthol. That is why I ordered this product again.The shipment arrived sooner than expected and the product is undamaged. I was keeping my fingers crossed because the climatic condition for the past few days has been extremely hot. Said and done. the lip balm did not melt.I. highly recommend. NATURAL ICE MENTHOLATED SPF15 Lip Balm for every one for daily use.Thank you. people at NATURAL ICE and thank you. AMAZON.SincerelyKJ Kumar"
1,"Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips. that peel and bleed.  Chapstick. Carmex. etc...  work for me. but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So. I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST. and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product. I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands. not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful."
1,"In an urgent need to fix badly cracked/chapped lips I turned to Amazon to find a lip balm.I first tried outBurt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube. .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)only to end up with no improvement after 3 or so days. Although this might not be a fair amount of time I was in agony over my lips and needed a quick fix. I was in need of moisturizing my lips and repairing them. not just protecting them from further damage.I turned to Mentholatum Natural Ice hoping this would be an improvement over Burt's (for me. not that either product is bad) only to find out they were pretty much the same. There was no noticeable difference and my lips weren't improving after another 3 days.I would recommend this product for proactive lip protection. but I would look elsewhere for a moisturizing lip balm when being reactive to cracked/chapped lips."
1,"This is by far the best product...ever...for Urinary Infections.  Better than anything you can have prescribed by a Doctor.  I did a lot of research about Cystex before I even ordered it.This is a very cleaver product...each tablet contains 1/2 of a normal aspirin. which acts against the immediate pain. and another ingredient that creates a chemical reaction in the kidneys and bladder and kills the bacteria and cures the problem.  I am a very allergic person and afraid to take any medication. but this is a dream come true for me.  Don't expect it to work in minutes. but all of a sudden...in a few hours...you will feel pain free.  The bottle says dose is 2 Tablets every eight hours. but I only take one every eight hours for two days and it's just great.  This is a staple for every medicine cabinet."
1,"This product is good and I like it. however the price keeps going up just like many other things once they notice it is selling and get greedy. I am seeking a generic brand of this product so that I can lower my out of pocket expenses. I am a man and do use this product. it really does help when you are exposed to bacteria in your system. I will seek an alternative if price does not lower back to the acceptable range it was at previously or seek another store that sells at the lower price."
1,"I keep these around for emergencies. Recently. I was waiting on the doctor to phone in a prescription for me because it was the second bladder infection in less than a month and I didn't have time for an office visit. Well. she took her sweet time about it. Without these. I probably would have ended up in urgent care over the weekend. With Cystex I almost forgot I had a bladder infection until I forgot to take them one day and I was quickly reminded. I highly recommend keeping a bottle of this in your medicine cabinet. especially if your prone to frequent bladder infections."
1,"I get UTIs when I get overtired/overtextended. around twice a year.  I had been taking AZO but it did not control the pain from the most severe infections (which always happen Saturday at 4 pm when the Doctor is not available until Monday!).  AZO was OK for mild infections.So this time I did some research and people spoke highly of Cystex. Since I didn't have enough time to order it from Amazon I bought it at CVS.  It is significantly (25-30%) cheaper than AZO and works better (at least for me). For the most severe UTIs I would still go to the Doctor and get antibiotics but for moderate and inconveniently timed UTIs. Cystex works beautifully and is a real savior. The pain went away in about 20 minutes and after 2 days of suffering. it was wonderful."
1,"Wish I'd known about this product in my 20s. Now that I'm in my 40s. I find that the hormonal changes are making UTIs something I need to be vigilant about again. after many years without them. I alternate between taking one of these at bedtime. & a daily tsp of D-mannose as a preventive measure. The mannose absorbs & carries away bacteria & the Cystex has a disinfecting action. so a multi-pronged approach. However. for travel these are a good deal less trouble than mannose which is a white powder. I have not had a single UTI in the 6 months I have been using this. I also give one to my elderly collie twice a week as she has developed the same issue. =o)  At least we're in this menopausal adventure together."
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
1,"This product changed my bladder problems from bad to better. but I still have flow problems.The main thing is that a full 6 tablets caused me to have spells of disorientation. I take no drugs. so it wasn't a compatibility issue. I now take 1 in the morning and two at bedtime with no ill effects. The full dose of 2 three times daily caused me problems.I am 68 and a major cancer survivor. but I don't think that affected it.UPDATE: 3/26/2013Working well now. I have chronic bladder problems. but I take 2 tablets in the morning. 1 in the afternoon. and 2 at night. I think I've adjusted to it now. Still have some flow issues. but the bladder discomfort is long gone. I recommend it! Better than Rx drugs.TaosGuy"
1,"When your kids go to school they get exposed to just about everything. About once a year our grandson gets the flu and sick to his stomach. He also has allergies that can make him sick to his stomach when he eats certain foods. Emetrol seems to settle down his nausea and help him not feel so ill.It contains no products that a child should be normally afraid of taking and it is doctor recommended. It does seem to help him a lot. It does recommend that you should not drink any fluids immediately before or after taking the product.We have had good success with it and we keep it on hand for those emergencies!"
1,"I've been a pack a day smoker for 40 years now and I just gotta kick this stupid habit. Been using these every day for the past six weeks now and have not yet smoked a cigarette in that time. I think that at this point it might just be psychological. but I'm still tempted to head over to 7-11 and buy a pack. so I keep putting on a 21 mg patch every morning and continue to tell myself how disgusting it would be if I start smoking again. Still taking it minute by minute and day by day. but I never could be doing this without the aid of the NicoDerm patches."
1,"Bought cheap CVS brand patches and they never stuck to my skin.  These stayed on the whole day through.It itched a little bit but nothing I coulnt eventually ignore (itching subsided as day wore on).When I removed the patch there was a red blotch there. but other than seeing it was red it didnt hurt nor itch nor have any other symptoms.  Redness went away by the end of the next day (you use a different area of skin for each new patch each day).Dreams were vivid when I left patch on overnight.  Vivid. but not nightmarish in any sense.  I actually enjoyed it.The nicotine was very effective in quelling my urge to smoke. though I didnt quit smoking.  At the peak of my efforts I was down to 6-7 cigarettes per day when I had been smoking close to 40.As a nicotine substitute. it delivers!"
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
1,"I quit smoking twice. so far (hope I won't have to quit a third time but that remains to be seen...).The first time I used NRT. specifically NicoDerm. I followed all the three steps. for as long as it was recommended. It worked. I was able to quit smoking. Staying quit though. that was a whole different matter. I took smoking again after about 3 months. and kept smoking for 6 months when I quit again. This time around I used Allen Carr's method. and it was by far a more efficient method. It's all about mentality and unfortunately. NRT reinforces the wrong kind of mentality."
1,"This is a stable and excellent product. The quality of the blades are very good. subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had. There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation. A very good product to buy. those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades. At Amazon - the price is excellent for this product. Just update - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back. NO RUSTS."
1,"I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far. I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip. I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham"
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
1,"This is the ONLY razor I've ever found that can cut through my husband's beard.  No. I don't live with Grizzy Adams. but he's close! :)  Life without these is just ridiculous - he has to shave 3 times a day with any other razor.  Really. no kidding.  This razor not only does an outstanding job. but it doesn't cut up his face in the process. I cannot say enough good about this razor.  He's been using them for 12 years and won't be without them.  Highly. highly recommend!"
1,"This product is an excellent buy and at 1/4th the cost at any store or online sites.  My family loves the product and recommend this product as a great buy.  I even subscribed so the product  is delivered without having to go and order it.  The product just comes when I decide how often.  This is a wonderful program which recommend to all who use products and not have to go and order it over and over!!  A must buy with an awesome program to make it easier to get the best at a good cost :)"
1,"I tried the Fusion product and have now gone back to Mach3.  I contacted P&G; over my concerns and must say that you are totally on your own if you have a problem.  P&G; won't even take the time to respond to a person letter or issues related to their products.The Mach3 is a good. simple and straight-forward product that works well.  The price on all blades is so very. very high when you think about the basic components. but one needs them.  So. this is my preference."
1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
1,"shaving almost daily for 30+ years now and tried most brands cartridge or disposable.atra was a great blade my worst experience the schick intuition plus.any of the mens mach3 blades a mug. brush and shaving soap is all you will needfor what may be one of life's finest pleasures...Closest shave on this planet. like silk baby!excellent blades. cost and experience for precision quick shavers..no man could ever beat our timing and terrain girlsmake sure you only buy your blades from amazon. don't get ripped upwith bootleg blades around here.blow dry them or place razor in a cup or stand at least(keep them clean/dry)for blade life.no goosebumps or forget about it. turn up the heat please.as for fusion and proglide i love them/but they are costly and mach3 willgive you the fine bare shave you desire for less."
1,"We've been using Mach 3 razors since the 1990s. and I buy this 15-pack here on Amazon because they're cheaper at $1.84/each than buying them at Costco.  Add in free SuperSaver or Prime shipping and they're a great deal!We like that the Mach 3 razor cartridges last for several weeks. even with daily shaving.  They give a smooth. close. nick-free shave without any irritation. and the blades don't rust when left in the shower.We've tried all kinds of blades through the years. and always come back to Mach 3."
1,"This is a decent blade that will give a nice shave for a few days. maybe weeks. with the added advantage of being able to get in tight spots better than later bigger head models of Gillette razors.  The biggest drawback is the price.  Gillette sucks you in with a low cost razor that uses high cost blades.  It's like some printers that are sold at cost or below just to get you into the market for expensive cartridges.  It's gotten so bad that many retailers keep Mach3 and Fusion blades under lock and key to prevent theft.  I've switched back to a double edged razor where you might expect an initial one-time cost of the razor but with very low cost replacement blades. not to mention double edged razors give closer shaves than the Mach3 or Fusion.  And they'll never go out of date.  So these blades get 3 stars for a combination of a decent shave combined with an exorbitant price."
1,"been using mach 3 blades for years. and they work great. I've (unknowingly) bought knockoffs on ebay before. and was able to tell the difference immediately and got a refund. Since then I've been buying them on amazon. because they're cheapest here as long as you buy a decent quantity.I've tried 4-blade and 5-blade razors. and none are any better. so I haven't bothered to permanently switch.also. you can make your blades last longer by storing the blades in mineral/baby oil when not in use. It prevents the oxidation and dulling of the blades"
1,"I have owned Mach3 razor for over 3 years now. The razor is good. but hard to differentiate its performance from Sense Excel ( I have owned that one before). Only reason I switched to Mach3 was honestly. I got bored using the same razor. The blades give normal performance. nothing out of the blue like they show on tv. It doesn't causes itching. so that the good part about the blades. However. after a month of use. for a good shave you will need multiple strokes on the same spot. Overall. decent purchase. nothing extraordinary."
1,"I'm an older guy with a very tough beard. When I was just beginning to shave (about 48 years ago) my father proudly gave me a Remington electric razor.  It never did a good enough job and I found myself going for a Gillette blade system.I have used these Gillette Mach 3's ever since they came out. They do the job for me better than anything else I've tried. so I've stuck with them. I buy them on Amazon when the price is right.For those reviewers claiming that they received fake blades. send them back for a refund. Or better yet. contact Gillette and let them know what you received.  Gillette wants to stop the trade in counterfeit blades and will be happy to work with you."
1,"I've used the Mach 3. in its different incarnations. for the past 10 years or so.  But I've always hated buying refill cartridges because of the price.  I even resorted to using disposable Mach 3s for the past few months. but I really hated them.  I was very happy to find these refill cartridges available on Amazon for such a good price. especially with Subscribe and Save.  Now I get them delivered to me at a great price.  Now if I could only find the Mach 3 Turbo or M3Power refill cartridges for the same price..."
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
1,"These razors are definitely solid. I've been using Mach 3 razors for a long time and always get a close shave. quickly and with cuts being very rare and usually the result of my own negligence. That being said these razors are just too expensive! They are even more in the grocery store. but even online they are more than 2 dollars when you buy a dozen! Shortly after I bought this box of razors I discovered Dorco which has a mach 3 like system with razors that costs less than a dollar each and are very sharp. I switched to Dorco after I finished out this box of razors."
1,"IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONI fell in love with Mach3 razors years and switched over from a single-blade (not straight-edge) razor.  I just wish the price was cheaper!  I saved a few bucks and time by ordering these Mach3 razors directly through Amazon.  Everything went fine with the order.  The package arrived quickly and the product was not opened.  The razors appear to be in their original packaging (plastic is not cut and it is the Gillete stuff).THE CATCHI thought I had gotten past all the online negative reviews of counterfeits.  Nonetheless. I found it quite odd that the plastic cases (holding 4 razors each) were scrapped and had smudges on them once I cut open the plastic packaging.  Those oddities seem to suggest the product is not brand new.CONCLUSIONAll seems fine so far.  We'll see..."
1,"Shaving is about as personal thing you can do. It's not an experience you can share. It doesn't make for scintillating conversation. So. PERSONALLY. the Gillette Mach 3 is the best razor for my beard. My beard is pretty tough: to use the belabored joke. my five o'clock shadow makes its appearance around noon. And it's thick. However. the skin underneath is very sensitive. This razor gives me that 'close shave' without irritating my face. The price for the cartidges are. yes. a little high. But it's a small price to pay for a product that works. It's sort of like paying a little extra for 'bathroom tissues'. (But that's another personal thing we do alone that rarely makes for scintillating conversation.)"
1,"Sometimes it just makes sense to shell out the additional funds for a superior product. I have a very tough and fast-growing beard that is a challenge to all the different razors (manual and electric) I've tried over the past 45 years.  I have stayed with the Mach 3 ever since it first came out and even convinced my wife that it would be good for shaving her legs. Actually she picked it up once instead of using her usual disposable and from then on I kept finding my razor in the shower.I learned a long time ago when using knives and axes that a good cutting edge needs to be complimented by a proper handle.  Normally the heavier and more durable the handle. the better the cut.  The Mach 3 handle is slightly beefier than most and it makes a difference. resulting in a good angle during application and a smoother shave with no irritation.  Until someone can prove to me that there is a better razor out there. we're sticking with the Mach 3."
1,"I'm buying this set of 6 shaving creams for my husband for the 2nd time....if he didn't like the cream he would have said not to purchase again. At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me. I think it smells good and my husband is happy with how it shaves....so there you have it. not exactly a rave review but definitely a 'thumbs up'.Cheers"
1,"$13 might seem like a lot of money for a bottle of cold medication but it's really difficult to put a price on good nights sleep!I was a little put off by the price of Vicks VapoSteam but I didn't realize how long this stuff will last. This bottle. for my Vicks humidifier. will definitely last the entire winter season. so the price isn't so much when you think about it that way.I worried that the smell might be too strong or even irritating but it doesn't overwhelm at all. it's actually quite comforting as it just sort of lofts around my bedroom.I don't use it only when I have a cold but when my head or nasal passages are just stuffed up from daily allergies (my cats!:) or the dry. discomforting winter air that's so irritating to my nose.  About 10 minutes after the humidifier is turned on. my breathing is so much easier and pleasant. I really appreciate this stuff."
1,"I've never understood why Amlactin (and same-formula creams/lotions) have never been very popular for dry skin. People always go for the cosmetic brand lotions. but Amlactin works differently and MUCH better.  The active ingredient in Amlactin is lactic acid. which exfoliates dry. itchy or bumpy skin. and is great for those with keratosis pilaris. After just a few applications. you'll notice soft. supple. silky smooth skin.It smells a touch &#34;chemical-ish&#34; but it's not strong and the scent doesn't last. like some scented lotions. Also. since it's not fragranced. guys can use it too (actually my dad does).It tends to run a bit on the pricy side for lotions. but it's definitely worth it. especially if you have rough. dry. bumpy skin."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
1,"I have used this product for Keratosis Pilaris Rubra (KPR - the type of KP that involves reddish bumps) all over my arms. Unfortunately. it makes the inflammation worse. While it (perhaps) may be good for Keratosis Pilaris Alba (the type of KP that doesn't have redness on/around the bumps). it worsens my type of KP since it inflames the skin. Produced a rash on my arms that put me through itchy. painful. burning hell for a week. It hurt my skin so bad.On a positive note: Good moisturizer though. Just worthless treatment for KP.What a waste of much needed money and hope for a cure for this darned skin ailment! :o("
1,"My dermatologist recommended AmLactin and Carmol 20 Cream to help with severe dry cracked heels. I used both products for several weeks into a couple of months and had *some* improvement but there was still a ways to go before I'd say my feet were going to be 'baby soft'. I wasn't really pleased with the expense. odor. and clammy feel that I'd experience with this combination and still getting lackluster results. so I did some more searching.I found a really good electric callous remover; it is made by Bario and hopefully you can find one with a google search. I continued to try different creams and lotions and have settled on one that really works and works fast - O'Keefes Creme. This creme is inexpensive. non-greasy. and unscented. I saw excellent results within a week - the elusive 'baby soft' feet everyone has been talking about. Finally!Hope everyone finds *something* that works for them."
1,"I've got keratosis pilaris. aka chicken skin. This does a great job of smoothening out the skin on my arms. It takes awhile to start working. as in weeks to months. but you'll definitely feel a difference. I feel less self conscious about my arms when in public wearing a short sleeved shirt.The only thing i didn't like about it was how runny it is. It's very watery. so you should rub it between your hands then distribute it to the body part otherwise it'll just drip everywhere. Also once it's on your skin it feels kind of sticky for awhile. till it absorbs more.Overall i'd recommends this product because it does it's job pretty well. Price is a little higher than i'd like but my arms are smoother so i'm happy to pay that price."
1,"I put this lotion on everything. It is hands down one of the most important beauty products that I couldnt live without. I use this all over and it is the ONLY lotion I have found which 1. doest break me out. 2. actually moisturizes my skin. 3. I can use on my body and my face. I blend drops of hyaluronic acid which I buy from Amazon in with the moisturizer for an added boost. It keeps my skin glowing. smooth and beautiful.I also use this on my boyfriends KP and it is the first time he said he has had any success in getting it to go away.I am impressed with this product more than any other beauty product."
1,"AmLactin moisturizing products come in different strengths to help alleviate rough. dry skin. This 'Moisturizing Body Lotion' is for everyday use (recommended use is 2X daily) and works well to keep skin hydrated.For a dry skin cure. begin with AmLactin's 'XL Lotion' for feet and hands or 'Ultra Hydrating Body Cream' for all over smoothing. Once your desired results are achieved. switch to this one for maintenance.Currently Amazon directly sells only the Moisturizing Body Lotion. It is also the only Amlactin product available through Subscribe and Save. Other AmLactin products are available from third parties. some of whom are Prime eligible.You'll be hard pressed to find the Moisturizing Lotion anywhere for less than Amazon and I cross my fingers that Amazon will again directly sell the other AmLactin products."
1,"My husband brought this home to me and I was excited to use it. I have very dry skin and I am always looking for soothing body butters that moisturize. Well this stuff is not even close. and should not be considered by anyone with very dry skin. It goes on smooth and then disappears. never to be felt again. My skin sucked it right in and was dry again in about 10 minutes. There is a reason why it states on the label to apply twice a day. but it still didn't make a difference. Its an ultra liquified lotion.I'm happy it worked for other people. but like Marissa. it did not work for me. For the record. I bought Nivea Essentially Enriched body cream. I love it! Its greasy at first. but my skin is soft. smooth. and STAYS moisturized all day. AND you only have to apply it once."
1,"I bought this lotion after a friend recommended it.  After my first use. the ammonia smell was too much to bear....it cut clear through my clogged nasal passages (I have a really bad cold).  Perhaps I should have known this ammonia scent would happen since ammonium lactate is the 2nd listed ingredient...but for some reason. I did not review the ingredients list so it didn't even occur to me.  This lotion is so very expensive that I expected something different.  Due to the very prominent ammonia smell. I couldn't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.  Surely there is a more pleasant way to exfoliate and moisturize."
1,"I live in the southwest and had pretty dry skin so my doctor recommended I try this stuff.  After about a week of use. once a day every day. I notice an obvious difference in my skin.  Areas that were dry and peeling aren't anymore and my skin is noticeably softer.  I ordered this size because I like lotions that have a pump. I find I used them more frequently and the bottle isn't as messy. and this one is no exception.  I would certainly recommend this product!"
1,"Yes. this stuff stinks. I think one of my pharmacy customers said it best: 'It makes me smell like Chicken in a Biskit crackers.' BUT. all alpha hydroxy acid products have a distinct. somewhat unpleasant smell. If your alpha hydroxy acid product doesn't stink. it probably doesn't have much (or any) alpha hydroxy acid in it.I guess they could try to cover it up with heavy fragrance. but that's never a good idea for a product used for treating skin conditions. The stink does fade after a few minutes. but if you apply it heavily. it will still be detectable for a few hours.I don't like how thick this is. but that's just a personal preference. Many people will enjoy the texture.Works well for keratosis pilaris. if you use it religiously. Helps dry rough feet a bit. but mostly if you start off with a clean slate (get rid of the corns/calluses first)."
1,"I have extremely dry skin and was constantly itching and scratching. sometimes actually causing bleeding. I tried AmLactan Mosturizing Body Lotion and FINALLY got some relief from the constant scratching. It took about four days to completely stop all the scratching. I used the product just once a day. even though the directions say to apply twice daily. Now my skin is soft and silky feeling and the scabs from bleeding have disappeared. The ammonia like smell of older bottles that I have used is no longer present. They seem to have improved the formulation. It's now completely odor free. I just found the 20 ounce size on sale at Costco.com for $15.49 including shipping. I will never stop using this product. It works just as advertized. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin and itching. Visit the manufacturers website at amlactin.com for more information and you can even sign up for their newsletter. I'm a fan FOREVER!"
1,"I got this form my local store because of an article I read. It works great on feet and body. I had a bad callus on my food - I know. disgusting. sorry. BUT I used this every night for about a week before it began to disappear. It makes my feet soft and absolutely amazing. HOWEVER. if you have cracked heels or calluses. they will come back if you do not use this lotion continuously. I guess that's the downside of it. I found this out the hard way when I stopped using it once my feet felt like velvet.Just so you know the generic name for this is Ammonium Lactate Topical. Exactly same stuff. but... cheaper."
1,"My dermatologist recommended I use this lotion for extremely dry skin.  (I don't have any other skin conditions. so please keep that in mind if you are considering using this product for a specific issue other than dry skin.)I've been using it twice a day for about 5 days and am totally impressed with the results.  My skin was VERY dry and VERY itchy. and this lotion has completely eliminated those symptoms.  My skin feels great. and I'm not constantly itching and fidgeting!My only complaint is that the lotion is tacky when applied.  This little feature is annoying. but not bad enough to make my stop using the lotion.  I highly recommend this lotion for super dry skin."
1,"I have a moderate case of KP that seems to be getting worse with age.  I bought this lotion at the store a week ago and after using it for just a few days. my arms look so much better.  I'm hoping if I continue to use it. the KP will go away completely.  So far. it's the only thing that has helped this condition.  I didn't have very high hopes for it but it is worth a shot if you are suffering from KP."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
1,"Purchased this to use on a thyroidectomy scar immediately after surgery. I used it for a year before giving up. It did provide some relief to the itchy dry feeling of a healing wound but it did nothing to diminish the scar.I also used this on a scar left from severe acne immediately when it was safe to use. It actually made it worse. My scar became beat red. I discontinued use and began to apply aloe gel to the scar. Within one day the redness was gone and the scar began to diminish.There are positive reviews on this product. maybe it will work better for you. It's very expensive. I would recommend trying an aloe gel first. I purchased a large bottle for $3 at Trader Joe's."
1,"My Physical Therapist recommended this to me to help with tissue mobility above the area where I had a plate and screws put into my fibula where I had surgery for a broken bone.  It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible.  It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box.  That said it did accomplish what my PT wanted but I don't give 5 stars because I don't see it as a &#34;must have&#34; or &#34;must buy&#34; which I consider a 5 star rating to be."
1,"I have yet to see if it will improve overall healing of my scar.  I won't know for several months but my initial experience with this product is mediocre.  Only a tiny amount may be applied without having a flaking mess on my skin after it dries.  The box says that it is must be rubbed in well and even that does not keep the flaking away unless only a tiny amount is used at a time.  It forms a film on the skin.I wish I had ordered the mederma with spf in it because whenever I leave the house I have to apply spf anyway.  Consider that when you buy.  Also. you will not need a lot of this product unless you have a large scar to cover.  Consider the smaller tube."
1,"I have big skin grafts. and I stopped using it after 6 months. then began again a year later.  And I saw almost immediate results when I began again.  Even my boyfriend noticed.  I have also been using it on a  section of tattoo that I just got which scarred on a few lines.  In a few months the raised skin came down and it doesn't bother me anymore.  The stuff definitely works.  Too bad its so expensive in stores.  The gel is tough to get out of tube when it gets 1/2 full."
1,"I can assure you a 100% you will not see any improvement in this from 1 tube! Got to help with unsightly stretch marks and thought this might help with them. but knew this would not cure them. I applied the gel as directed to the affected area as directed for 3 months and saw absolutely no improvement in the skin or color of the scars. and the fact that the tube is so small you will not get enough of the gel to last to see any improvement with out several tubes! So I rate this 1 out of 5 stars considering this is but a common snake oil and should not be advertised to help improve stretch marks! And on a side not I would not recommend this to anyone looking to improve the sight of scars or stretch marks!"
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
1,"I had a HUGE newly healed scrape that took up half my forearm and it was starting to scar up in a weird bumpy way.  I wasn't sure if this was really going to work because reviews seemed mixed. but it sounded like the newer the scar is. the better it works.  Honestly. I've been using it for a few weeks (I try for once a day. but I occasionally forget) and the results are AMAZING.  It literally looks better every day.  The weird bump &#34;over scarring&#34; areas were gone after TWO days.  Now my scar had JUST healed.  I started applying it a few days after the last of the scabbing had gone. so I suspect that's why I've had such great luck."
1,"I've used Mederma in the past and it worked really well. Well. I've had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella. I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing. I've been using it for a little over a month.and again it's working. This is good stuff. I saw improvement in a week. Of course I would purchase this again.if fact I'll be doing that real soon. I would recommend this to a friend. I think Mederma deserves more than five stars."
1,"I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing."
1,"Thanks to an accident at the river I ended up with a large scar at my wrist. I have scars over most of my body so it didnt bother me. What did bother me is going to hand cashiers money and them looking down at my wrist and looking back up at me with that 'oh my he tried to' looks. The mederma has smoothed the surface and reduced the red shade by 2/3 after 4 weeks. I'm going to continue using the product for another 4 weeks and see how much better it gets."
1,"I had a hip replaced and my doctor had recommended this product to help reduce scarring since I scar easily.  I had a fairy long and nasty looking scar so I decided to give this a try.  Here is what I found:1.  The cream is easy to apply and goes a long way!2.  The cream does soften the skin area and makes it itch less.3.  After 3 months my scar has reduced noticeably.  Instead of being raised and hard. it is flat and soft.  There is still a red line. but that is fading in places.While this product is definitely not an instant fix. it does work!  I have several scars that I have acquired through the years that while small. look far worse than this major surgery scar does now!  I am quite happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to reduce the amount of scar tissue."
1,"I've used Mederma diligently for a couple of months; it was great in making fresh scars barely visible. but not so great with old scars. It is worth a try. but be prepared to be very disciplined - it won't work if it's not applied at least twice a day. for at least 2-6 months.On the other hand. and to be completely honest. I believe petroleum jelly. aloe vera or other similar skin repair products would have the same results if applied 3-4 times a day. for 3-6 months (as directed for Mederma). since the skin regenerates and changes almost completely within this interval. I'm sorry I can't write a raving review and collect dozens of helpful votes. but this is my honest opinion. I don't want to be a kill-joy. I just wish someone had told me the same so I could save some money."
1,"I use this for cracked heels. cuticle oil. pimples. sunburn. & dry chapped hands and lips.  A little goes a long way. and it absorbs nicely (sometimes takes a few minutes to go away).  I'm always amazed how much better my hands are in the morning when I put e-oil on before I go to bed.  Same with my heels.  The higher IU's is too thick for my tastes. this seems to have the best viscosity for whatever I need it for.  I even put it on a Q-Tip and put it in my nose when I'm getting ready to run the tiller or mow because of the dust.  Keeps me from getting such a nasty sinus headach and has a nice lemony smell compared to the menthol that's for colds and flu.  This is awesome stuff."
1,"I never try vitamin E oil before but I am using vitamin C serum which is good to follow  with vitamin E oil especially at night time for better results. this oil is awesome. I just love it!!! is very rich so just a few drops (2 to 3) covers my entire face. the bottle is small enough which makes it very convenient for traveling. some oils have  a rancid smell. this oil smells a bit like lemon grass it's a pleasure to apply it after my vitamin C serum. leaves my skin so smooth and dewy for the next morning. I highly recommend this product."
1,"Niacin is quite effective in reducing bad cholesterol in your blood. especially in my case. I am sensitive to most statin drugs prescribed by doctors.  The usual downside to it's regular use is flushing from dilating the blood vessels while it is being absorbed.  Slo Niacin has an enteric coating that slows the absorbtion. so that the &#34;flush&#34; is not a problem. It is important to watch the date on the product. as the enteric material loses some of it's effect with time. Slo Niacin is also much less costly than statin drugs."
1,"If you have high LDL cholesterol and you have not been able to reduce it with diet and exercise. this Slo-Niacin tablets will do the job. The slow release minimizes flashing that is normally associated with Niacin and the results are incredible. I have been trying to lower my Cholesterol for the last couple of years but with no success. I was stuck in the range of 230-235 and even though I was taking Flash-Free Niacin. my number was not dropping. Two months ago I found out by reading posts on the Internet that Flash-Free Niacin does not work for lowering cholesterol. So. I started looking for another way and found the Slo-Niacin which is regular niacin that is released slowly. This worked great. I took 1500 mg a day for a month and my cholesterol dropped from 233 to 130.  I was shocked by how well it worked.  It makes you wonder why doctors prescribe drugs when a natural supplement like Niacin works so well."
1,"I used Slo-Niacin for several years before switching to Niaspan (Rx required). I take a heavy dose (1500 MG nightly). After the initial couple of weeks the flushing. hot and itchy skin. occurred only about once a week. With Niaspan. the flushing (etc) happened only 2-3 times per month. Now. my drug plan has raised my cost for Niaspan by 250% !!So. I will be returning to Slo-Niacin--but the cost to me will be only $11.92 per month using Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save.' This is in contrast to the new cost of Niaspan at $50 per month. Therefore. when the itching comes on I will chant a mantra of 'But. I am saving $37 a month!'"
1,"i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well. after just taking it for two days. i had a terrible reaction to it. felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level. so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill. but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
1,"Being constantly anemic. I always dread having to take Iron pills because they leave my stomach so upset.  The Slow Fe tablets are pricey but they are worth it!  No stomach problems associated with iron at all!  My big complaint is that they are extremely hard to open.  It is so time consuming and difficult.  If you have arthritis. opening these will be a nightmare.  I still think the benefits outweigh the cons.  When I am bored. I stand and open 10 or so tablets at a time and put them in a pill box."
1,"OK. so I tried to save some $$ by getting the generic at my local store.  Big mistake.Went back to the doctor and he recommended this brand by name. so I ordered it here because it was cheaper than my drug store.I am on my second box now and it has made a world of difference in how I feel and in my test results.  I always thought generics were just the same as the name brands. but that is not the case for this supplement. I will be buying this brand again"
1,"This product (by Nature's Bounty) claims that there are 1 billion ACTIVE Lactobacilli in the pills. The best established test for ACTIVE Lactobacilli is to give them substrate (warm milk) and let them grow over night. Test Result: Two pills smashed to powder and mixed with warm milk (37'C) did NOT produce any growth (fermentation) overnight!. That means that Nature's Bounty is selling us Cellulose + Fructose flavored with strawberry. Should have done this test earlier. Will never buy from Nature's Bounty again. And will start testing one after another other vendors. Hope there will be a product for real?!"
1,"For the most part. I like certain kinds of yogurt. but I find that I just can't eat it every day.  I don't like it THAT much.  But I do want to take steps to keep my digestive system on track. and these small. sweet acidophilus chews are a great way to do just that.  I actually take one every day. even if I do eat yogurt.  Plus. the price cannot be beat.  It's always great to be able to consume things that are good for you without totally breaking the bank."
1,"The joke is that this deodorant is not the one we received. even though we wanted this one. Yes. I am aware that I am not rating the correct product. but another Speed Stick (the one that comes in white and smears. and was the last one we wanted) product. Makes anyone upset to order an specific product and receive a totally different product instead. That is why the 1 Star review. For if someone chooses this product and receives one they did not order. I think that would warrant a star. Noticed this has happened more than once. according to other reviewers. and that is Baloney. because what it means is that someone in a warehouse is substituting products at their whim.I know the actual product is great. exactly what we wanted. but since it is deceiving in showing the picture when there are no intentions on delivering that product. I give this one 2 Stars at most."
1,"Wow!! Great price for this pack of six 3.25 sticks of deodorant. Mennen surprised me with this musk deodorant & the quality of it.This deodorant is long lasting & works very well in all situations. This goes on clear & leaves no type of stain on any type of shirt. One stick is long lasting even after applying it several times a day.This is a great way to stock up at an affordable price. I am very.very particular about what I buy & use but could not find anything negative to say about this item."
1,"I've been using Speed Stick deodorant regular for years.  It is effective at killing stink.  It has a nice smell when you apply it.  The smell is not overpowering and it is not noticeable after a few minutes (I have smell sensitivity).  This product does not stain clothes or leave any marks.  I tried Tom's and Trader Joe's natural deodorant but neither of those worked and I could smell my own BO long before the day was over.  While I like to buy products that have no animal testing. I draw the line with BO and use my Speed Stick deodorant.  It's great for men or women and it's inexpensive."
1,"I've used Speed Stick before in the past and had a good experience. So. when buying online I figured I'd stick with a brand that I know will not make me break out. Well. it did not make me break out. however. the odor protection is not what I remember it to be. I really like the smell of the musk Speed Stick. Probably one of my favorite smelling deodorants. Kind of a manly cologne or aftershave scent. not too strong but every now and then you'll get a whiff and it smells great. Unfortunately. the odor protection does not last all day. Probably only last about half the day and by the end of the day I can definitely tell it isn't working anymore. I still give it three stars though for the scent."
1,"I only use this aftershave in the summer because it tends to dry my skin in the brutal Chicago winter. It works great after a nice straight razor shave; smells great and cools my skin. It's alcohol-based. but I'm surprised it doesn't sting as much as I expected. Since the dispensing hole is a bit too big. I cover half of it with my thumb before squirting it into my hand. One day. a female acquaintance hugged me and commented I smelled really good. Two weeks later she asked me out ;)"
1,"My husband is very picky about shave gels. primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin.  My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack. even though the price was under $3 a can with super saver shipping.  He is not happy with this product.  He's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products. namely. Gillette Fusion. which he prefers.  Also. insofar as use on his sensitive skin. the gel is only so-so.  The fragrance is okay with him.  However. what he particularly doesn't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide.  Now we have about four cans left. which he will grudgingly use. unless I can find him a deal on Fusion.  He's encouraging me to find one...soon."
1,"Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results. you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!"
1,"This Ultra Brite Advanced Whitening toothpaste I purchase in my local store and find it to be a superb toothpaste better than the fancy and more expensive brands.+ This cleans and foams up better in the mouth than the other brands.+ Cleans and WHITENENS better than the expensive kind I have found.+ Works great with a Spinbrush or Oral B Rechargeable toothbrush. Noticed that the Oral B one and this toothpaste work superbly together as my teeth shine and look whiter and cleaner!- For me. since I have somewhat sensitive teeth. so I use this every other day (for whitening abilities) and I use Sesodyne toothpaste on the alternate days. This works for me and keeps my sensitive teeth happy and with no sensitivity at the same time.Highly recommend this!"
1,"We use this toothpaste for two reasons; it works and it's inexpensive. We normally keep multiple boxes of this toothpaste around the house and at this point probably have around five or six unopened boxes in reserve.The toothpaste has a pleasant taste and is only moderately foamy which. in my opinion. simplifies the whole tooth brushing process.As another reviewer has pointed out a consumer testing organization has given the toothpaste high marks; that I'll have to admit was the reason I first bought this brand. According to the box the product is made in Mexico and distributed in the USA by Colgate-Palmolive. It contains sodium fluoride .24 % for anticavity protection.We have been pleased with this product for years and see no reason to change."
1,"Now how often do THOSE two words go together? Not that often in a toothpaste! Consumer Reports got me to try Ultra Brite but the results keep my buying it. I've been using it for years and personally I've never noticed any whitening effects *but* it makes my teeth feel clean and maintains a healthy mouth. Rarely any dental issues here in years. My teeth look great and I frequently get compliments on my smile. These days I use a whitening paste half the time but I keep Ultra Brite in the rotation too.UB has a nice minty taste that is not totally over powering - meaning I can actually taste food again within the hour. The paste is a nice consistency and doesn't produce too much foam even with my Oral B electric toothbrush. The price can't be beat - usually a dollar or less locally.Very pleased with this product and highly recommended."
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
1,"I ordered this a year ago for my grandmother who has arthritis & bruises easily.  Once she tried it. there was no other alternative that worked as good for her (she was using other topical creams & some burned her skin. or left a rash).  This soaks in quickly. doesn't burn or irritate the skin & actually does lighten her bruises within a couple days of using this day & night (she bumps into anything & a bruise starts. Immediately she puts this on & the bruise either doesn't happen or it fades away in a couple days).Now I am ordering again because I use this before & after workouts. when I get bruises and also to ease out the swelling & redness of acne on my face (yes. just 2 times a day on clean skin I rub this in & within a week my large. angry acne marks are gone).This stuff works quickly on pain. doesn't stain. is all natural & we could not be happier in my home using this product."
1,"Of course everyone has a different response to treatments but this has been the go to gel for minor scraps & bruises for the family.It's amazing as upon immediate application its soothes the wound and eases pain.all while healing and lessening the presence of a scar.It's a must for first aide kits and medicine cabinets especially if you have kids.I even used it on minor burns and yes. it works like a charm.Gr8 product!!Also if you have body aches.cramps or muscle pain try arnica tabletsArnica Montana 30x 250 Tabletsnow these little tablets out weigh any other pain relief tablet OTC."
1,"I grabbed this for my natural first aid kit- I use it fairly often now since its great for diminishing the pain and appearance of bruises as well as great for sore backs and hands resulting from yard work or-ahem-a tough camping trip...My son is nearly 2 and gets bruises from regular toddler antics. it is nice to know I can help the bruises go away faster- especially when we know we will be attending an event where photos will be taken...My husband only needs one application for a sore back. I used it on a smashed finger with good results- only needed it a few times to make the throbbing go away and the pain subside.the only side effect/gross part is that this can loosen dead skin-probably has alcohol in it-and the skin or other dirt and grime will pill up and swirl around on the surface when you massage this in. Yuck.but this is effective and naturally based -its just a nice product to have on hand or in your first aid kit."
1,"Hey. I am a born skeptic.  But I think that this product actually works.  And it is easy to apply.  The only down side is a somewhat unpleasant aroma. but away from the nose this does not matter.  My pain is most often in the lower back.  If I apply the gel and then sit in a chair that encourages good posture. the pain is relieved within a quarter hour.  If you have tried cooling compounds. heating compounds. etc.. and do not have a solution for pain yet. try this gel. and hopefully it will work for you as it does for me."
1,"Never would I think something so topical could work on my deep down 'what the heck did I do to cause this' back pain - but WOW.  I put it on about 2 hours ago and I don't hurt now.  Pretty amazing.  This tube is HUGE for the price. there is no smell. no sticky - it absorbs and goes right to work.  I'm no organic-shmanic gal here... I don't buy into the 'natural is better' crowd (few. but we're out here) - still - this product floored me.  It works.  I wish I'd known about it years ago.  And this is the best value anywhere.  I'm using it for muscle pain and stiffness.  You should too."
1,"Have used this Homeopathic gel for decades. As a professionally trained Modern. and Classical Ballet. dancer for over 30 + years. I have sworn by this for preventative as well as helping to speed-up recovery/healing time of sports-type & over-use injuries. Ii is essential to us dancers and athletes alike. Great for contusions. bruises and over-use injuries. Recommend. Only remember to remove all oils and perfumes from skin BEFORE using. and to be diligent enough to use in the morning and evening both. for best results."
1,"I bruise easily. and they last forever (sometimes months).  This will make my bruise disappear within a week.  The one thing I've noticed is that while the bruise will disappear. the area may still be sore like a normal bruise (although the soreness won't last as long as a normal bruise).  Definitely worth the effort and cost!!!  I had gum surgery several years ago. which is where I learned of this.  I applied both the topical gel. and took the small pellets both before and after surgery.  My jaw never bruised (which was a miracle in itself). and had minimal swelling which went away in a couple days."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
1,"I have been lifting for about 3 years now (benching about 95lbs when I started) and about a year ago I hit a wall where I could not seem to increase my max anymore.  So then about 6 months ago I started using muscle milk. glutamine powder. BCAA pills. and this Creatine Fuel.  When Before I started this regimen I was maxing out on the bench at about 185 and just last week I did 245 for the first time and I have increased in pretty much every other area as well.  I have also noticed that my arms look and feel much fuller. they are up to 16 inches now and I hope to continue my journey and maybe someday in the next year hit the 300 mark on bench and make good gains in other areas as well."
1,"i can't say this stuff work wonders.but I can't say that it doesn't help. Consistency is the key to all work outs and lower calorie intake. There those who truly believe in this product So don't take my review to heart. It could work for you better then other people everyone is different and since we all have different metabolism and health system it will work wonders for some and for some it won't. this is a case of try for yourself and see if it works for you.  Since individual result may (will) vary."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I have read from a lot of people saying it doesn't leave you groggy but if I take more than half a teaspoon I find it makes me that way.  I don't take melatonin unless I cant sleep at all or if I am not tired but it starts to work pretty fast no matter how much I take.  I guess since its a liquid it affects you quicker since I have used the pill form before.  My 3 year old who is autistic has problems sleeping and staying asleep and as far as getting to sleep she will usually go to sleep in about 10 to 15 minutes.  This was recommended over medication from our doctor which is what we prefer.  She still wakes up some nights but I don't think it has too much to do with the melatonin as it is with her.  Overall I recommend this to help people sleep naturally without resorting to medication."
1,"We have been giving this to my grandson for over a week and find that it helps to calm him down.  We give it to him about an hour before bed and it helps him to go to sleep at night instead of 11:00pm or later.  It has a 'sweet' taste so he takes it readily. Now everyone get get some rest.  He has not been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD but is a very active little boy.  I would definitely recommend it.  FYI: we are also giving him Synaptol twice a day which seems to take the 'edge' off during the day.  This has relatively no taste at all."
1,"These caplets are fine to swallow and have everything I need in them.  My doctor told me I was low on iron so I've been trying different vitamins with Iron in them.  In these vitamins though is an additive that turns my urine to bright yellow no matter how much water I drink.  I don't care for that.  I went to the doctor to see if I was having a bladder or kidney problem and all is well.  The doctor told me it was the food coloring that they put in them.  Why do that?"
1,"I used to get nauseous every day. and couldn't figure out why. I would feel fatigued and get dizzy spells also. I had tried other multi-vitamins before. and couldn't tell any difference so I stopped taking vitamin supplements. Then I started taking this one. and I stopped getting nausous. and I find that I can think more clearly and have a more sustained energy throughout the day compared to days that I don't take it. I have been taking this for a couple of years now and I'm very satisfied."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
1,"Consumer groups have a lot of info on line about which vitamins are most effectively absorbed.I'll save you the pain of what I went through reviewing the top 100 vitamins out there:Efficacy of vitamins ranges over a wide scale. The best cost perhaps $3 a day to use. The worst do the job 10% or less as well as the best ones. Name brand rarely coincides with effectiveness.These are powder in a capsule. so they absorb rapidly and do their job well. Cost is reasonable. too.What I found after a lot of research. was these occupy a unique niche between the dollars-a-day designer vitamins and the pennies a day junk. offering nearly the performance of the former at nearly the price of the latter.Enjoy! It's great having quality vitamins and not paying exorbitant prices.Recommended - and used - for years. 'It's all the vitamin you'll ever need!'To your health!"
1,"I've always found it difficult to decipher the pro's and con's of daily vitamin consumption.  The only thing I can offer is over the last month or so I've noticed a slight reduction in energy and focus.  Overall I still feel decently healthy. however. it recently dawned on me that about 3 weeks ago I stopped taking these daily vitamins b/c my supply ran dry.  Now it wouldn't be right to contribute this reduction in energy solely on the demise of my vitamin consumption but it would be safe to say it's very possible these vitamins may have been benefiting me all along.  I'm placing another order regardless :)"
1,"I started using this in combination with Raspberry Ketones and found it made me stronger in my workouts. I have also been able to keep weight off with it. But remember. nothing is a miracle pill. I use it in combination with regular workouts and watch what I eat. I keep track of calories and always expend more calories than I use. If you are not wanting to loose weight then taking this along with the Keytones about 30 minutes prior to workout should help you to be able to move more weight."
1,"I've been taking CLA for about 5 weeks.  I'm quite obese and I've noticed that my belly fat is shrinking more than usual when I'm restricting calories. I am eating about 1800 calories a day for the last four months and losing about 3-4 lbs a month.  That is fine since I've lost hundreds of lbs. over the years and always gained it back.  What I'm hoping is that I won't gain it back this time; that I can just continue eating the same. 1800. and my body. which fights me to gain. will be happy with the lower weight.  One weird thing that I have noticed is that when I take Tylenol. it's doesn't work anymore.  I take it 2-3 times a week for arthritis.  I can't take NSAIDS so that is unfortunate."
1,"I purchased this product because I have decided to be in TOTAL GREAT HEALTH. I did not want to start off with anything that would give me the shakes or have me feeling weird or bad. I wanted something natural to help with my stomach fat. I can say that I have changed my diet. smoothie in the mornings. water all day. and a full course meal with protein and vegetables. no bread and no sugar. walking every day for 30-45 minutes. I have have seen a tremendous result. I feel much better and I am determined to obtain total health."
1,"I enjoy that one soft gel is a serving. For me this was a good value. especially with being 1200mg per serving as opposed to something were you have to swallow 2 or 3 pills for the same serving.This is a very effective form of CLA with Tonalin and for the price it isn't bad. However. if foul smells bother you. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The bottle I received left such a strong odor in the room long after I took my pill and closed the jar. that I cannot take it out of the house.It's effectiveness and ease to take is great. it just really needs to stop smelling so foul.PROS:Simple to takeEasy on stomachEasy to swallowEffectiveCONS:Bad flavorBad Smell"
1,"Pros:-Small-Great stats (high in protein and calories relative in size)-The Chocolate and Mocha Chip tastes Great-No chalky tasteCons:-Fiance thinks they taste awefulBefore I bought this product I always thought Balance bars were low in protein and just a womans meal supplement.  Well. now they are my main protein bars and eat them all the time between meals when I am hungry.I would give these a 5 star. best nutritional/protein bars I have ever tried.  No chalky taste. very smooth texture (overly smooth compared to others) however. the fiance hated them.  Not sure why. but she could not even eat them. however. she loves the Cliff bar brand."
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
1,"I'm always the type that needs to snack on items through the day to avoid headaches and feeling fatigue.  I'm very physically active and don't have time to spend for large meals so need something filling. easy to take with me. and is delicious.  The chocolate craze is essentially like a desweetened chocolate bar for me.  I just can't tire of the taste. it's the best I've ever had with these nutritional bars.  I only wish they were cheaper as it's quite pricey.  But as the saying. you do get what you pay for."
1,"Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars. this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar. chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it. and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information. these bars do have a lot of protein (15g). but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
2,"This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup. 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen."
2,"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color. and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated. of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored. foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book. and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies. and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!"
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
2,"My daughter 1 year old really likes this book.  I bought it because of its similarity to the 10 little ladybugs book.  It has the same sort of colorful illustrations and I like it better as the ladybugs are not as pretty as the sparkly butterflies.  This book teaches colors as each of the butterflies finds a place to stay for the night.Update - My daughter is now well grown but this book sticks in my mind still - we read it so many times.  I would say it was one of her very favorites when she was young."
2,"So I actually bought this thinking it was the entire Lesson 2 kit. However. I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book."
2,"It took me about 40 minutes to read this lesson plan thoroughly; while it is inexpensive at under five dollars. I still don't know if that is necessarily a good value. As some reviewers have pointed out. much of the book focuses on advertising Wilton products; without all of this the useful material in the book could have been condensed down to a couple of pages. I did like the photographs and the techniques for making different consistencies of buttercream for different uses. I had initially planned on getting the subsequent lesson plans as well. but I don't think it will be worth it. If you have any skill/experience with cake decorating at all. I'd recommend skipping this book."
2,"This Wilton book is awesome.  My local craft shop did not offer the fondant course when I wanted to take it so I decided to teach myself.  I followed the lessons in the book and my fondant cakes have improved greatly.  In my area the Wilton Method instructors are not so great so I am happy I was able to save the money on the class but still get all of the wonderful Wilton advice.  I would definitely recommend not only buying this book. but seeing how much you can teach yourself before spending the money on the class."
2,"I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner. I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set. that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas. from Amazon.that work very well. I also bought the bench knife. and found a 16' cake lifter. and a 18' cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon. however. the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book. great starter outer! Oh yes. I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely.Super Chef David"
2,"I ordered this lesson plan because I took the first two courses of Wilton's Cake Decorating. and I didn't want to sign up for the 3rd course only because I didn't want to spend so much money for the classes. So I bought the kit in Michaels figuring I would teach myself but this time the lesson plan wasn't included in kit like the first 2 kits were. This lesson plan is great and if you have some experience with working with fondant and gum paste this will be a piece of cake for you. no pun intended. But this definitely isn't for a beginner."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
2,"I absolutely love this book! Before purchasing. I found myself gathering bits and pieces of information from the wilton site to make the flowers and borders that I wanted. but this book puts them all together neatly without leaving anything out. I recently purchased Colette's Cakes which is also wonderful. but so much of it is advanced. and I'm just not there. I only decorate for fun. This book sticks to basics which. for me. is essential to focus. If I see to much detail I tend to become frustrated and over anxious. Then I end up giving up. So. with this book I can actually follow the process and learn step by step without the frustration.The only small disappointment was the weight of the cover. The paper is a bit thin and will need some support or will probably not hold up very well. Nothing a little clear contact paper can't cure though. so no big deal."
2,"I've always loved cake decorating. ever since I took my first Wilton class.  Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.  The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.  It's a lot of fun but. I admit. a bit frustrating.  No matter how closely I follow the steps. my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.  I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book. as all Wilton Lesson Plans. it's great."
2,"This is an ok book for a new cake decorator. It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However. the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for 'cake decorating ideas' when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly. if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it."
2,"I'm a Star Wars fan and I bought this with the intention of using it for groceries but it turned into my new diaper bag. It's huge! I can fit everything i need in it where before I had my diaper bag and another bag and my purse. It has started to come apart on the side but I can sew it or order a new one it's so cheap. I am sure the intended purpose isn't for it to be used as a diaper bag daily but it works and I have gotten compliments on it even! It goes great with my Star Wars Vans too :D"
2,"I used to date this girl who loved Scrabble.  So. by association. I had to as well!  We used to play a lot - even with her Grandmother.  What they did. however. was 'cheat'.  We had one of these - this same Franklin Spelling Corrector you see here (an older model but same nonetheless) and you each of us was allowed to use it to come up with all kinds of crazy words.  I thought this was a dumb way to play Scrabble. at first. but then I came to love it.  If you're all 'cheating'. then it becomes a different game - the strategy changes.  We had a lot of fun.  Too bad I had to dump her for being utterly insane! (I'm sure she was bipolar-scitzophrenic or some variant thereof).  I kept the Franklin Spelling Corrector!  Still have it to this day!"
2,"Had my doubts that this would hold a 300 page paper back book because it's kinda thick and therefore stiff... NO Problem and the adjustable part of this holder is that the two parts that actually hold the book swivel so you can move them in or out to accommodate the size of book.... SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.  I am using it to take notes for study.  Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it... could not turn the pages.  This is a winner"
2,"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback. it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it."
2,"I use this for everything from propping up cookbooks in the kitchen to reading hardcovers at my desk while eating my lunch.  Most recently I've been using it for my Kindle 2.  Works great for everything. but a little tricky for some paperbacks because they slip around a little bit.  It does work best with the average-sized hardcover (think novel- sized).  Folds up nice and fits well in a drawer or in the front pocket of my backpack.  Definitely a handy thing to have around."
2,"This is a really convenient book stand if you like to read outside of home and don't have larger books. If you don't necessarily need the portability or if you have large/tall textbooks I would suggest you look at something more study as this tends to tip over/make indentations on the bottom of pages for those books. Also you can increase the height of the stand by pulling  up part of the metal frame. but even with doing this it doesn't really support larger books well enough to easily highlight."
2,"This is as described but for some reason. I was still expecting it to be a little larger. I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices. sandwiches. cucumbers. etc.  It's the perfect size for what I wanted.  You could also use it as a form for making pancakes. etc but they would be very small!  I wouldn't use it as a cookie cutter but my family makes double the size of the average cookie.  Maybe for mini cookies this would work..."
2,"I was leery about spending tis much for the Tupperware brand name product. but I wanted to upgrade to covered ice cube trays for use in our RV and didn't feel comfortable with some of the negative reviews I read of lower cost brands (mainly the plastic cracking after a few months use).  Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit. finish. and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!  I've already gotten tossed out the original open plastic ice cube trays which were just aggravating."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
2,"I had looked high and low for a 1 ounce souffle cup and lid set for our lunchboxes.  The only ones I could find were disposable. and I strive to make our lunches completely trash free.  (See some of my other reviews)The Smidgets are the perfect size for salad dressings. little candy treats or marshmallows. raisins. nuts...if it's little. it flies!  You'll love them.  I followed the tip from another Amazon reviewer and boiled them for 1 minute then re-sealed them while they are still hot to make the lids easier to take on and off.  Worked like a charm."
2,"I take vitamins. Most containers aren't big enough to hold them. These are perfect.* They have plenty of room - I don't have to methodically arrange my vitamins to allow the lid to close. I estimate these will hold around 20 big vitamins. 9/9/11 Update: I just attached an image showing this with 16 vitamins. I think it would hold 20 if you work at it. With 16. I can just drop them in and pop the lid on.* They are compact enough to fit into a jeans pocket.Yep. the lid is hard to get off the first couple of times. No worries after that. The bonus is that a snug lid means I don't worry about them opening and spilling my vitamins. Nice!My daughter loves these in her purse. too.The uses are practically endless (aspirin. gum. paper clips. skittles :)HIGHLY Recommended!"
2,"Here in Penna. we make pickled eggs. also known here as red beet eggs.  I use this container for that.  The square shape makes it fit neatly in the back corner of my fridge.  The lid fits well; the strainer is sturdy.  I've had mine for five to ten years. and it is still good as new.  I just bought one for my mother.  She had her red beets eggs in a jar. which cracked spilling red juice all over the bottom of her firidge.  I have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh.  I think this would also work to marinate a few pieces of chicken.  I also know someone who uses hers. without the strainer. to store brown sugar.  So. it is a multi-purpose container."
2,"You most definitely get what you pay for. these are very cheap and have already started to show signs of rusting after just a couple of months.  Also look carefully at the fork and knife. they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.  The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.  The spoons are also very disproportionate if you look at the little spoon it is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I hate to say it but I was not impressed with Ikea in this case. I had to buy a whole new set to replace this one."
2,"I was doubtful about getting two sets of these. but I am glad I did.  They are just right for children.  They don't hold all that much fluid so if there is a spill...and there is ALWAYS a spill...it isn't so bad.  I put them in the dishwasher on the top shelf.  They've been holding up well.  We've had a couple left in weird places that ended up holding science experiments but they washed up just fine. Get them.  They're terrific for families."
2,"were expecting . 1st off let me say this . it's made in China . It's smaller than your average lunch box and has no lil' drink bottle inside  either . Also the latch is plastic and although it's holding i've got my doubts as to it's longevity for my grandson . The box itself is however tin and although i like that it's metal . it's unbelievable thing metal and poorly hinged with simple folded over tangs or flaps as i'd call em that link it to the other and that's for sure not all that secure . As for the pro's or positives to this lil' box . it's Curious George and all kids love or loved his cute lil' monkey shennanigans at some point and time . The artwork is pretty well done and seemingly durable thus far . The price of course was a plus and sadly i'm realizing that we've got what we've paid for ..."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
2,"I've been using this almost daily for about a month. Easy to use. easy to clean. and looks nice on the counter. No real complaints. except that the bowl feels kind of thin. like it would crack easily. I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier. I hope I'm wrong about the bowl. but I guess only time will tell. Other than that. no complaints. and I'd recommend buying this!Update 6/27/13: After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up. and it's still doing what it's supposed to do. My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube. Obviously I knew this when I purchased it. but hindsight is 20/20."
2,"I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother's feeding tube.  She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition. but does well with her customary food.  I tried using a blender. but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.  We have used the Cuisinart I purchased when they were first introduced to the USA. which worked well but was inconvenient for on-the-spot use and for travel.  I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the 'cheaper' one.  I am impressed with its performance. ease of use and compact size.  It is clearly worth the small price I paid.  I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.  It is perfect for my intended use. and I can envision how to use it in cooking. I highly recommend it."
2,"well i'm not impressed because all it is.is a mini food processor. nothing spectacular as they all work the same. I did like the fact that I could get it in a different color which was blue. I thought I would use it more but I have only used it a couple of times. I still like my bigger food processor and feel I may have wasted my money buying it. it probably would be great for an older person who doesn't need the big food processor and only needs to chop up small stuff."
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
2,"This is a good little machine with limitations.  it is very cheaply made.  no question about it.  I expect it will last a few months.  BUT. for the price I can either get it replaced or just keep buying new ones.  Not the best consumer mentality. but I think that's how it's going to be.  It IS very small.  I had anticipated making sauces with it but even for small meals you need to do it in several batches.  I tried shredding vegetables in it and it nipped away at the outer skin of it but left me with some round balls of vegetable matter that required quite a bit of shifting.  It's easy to clean and while it has quite a few drawbacks. I see this getting much more use than my larger machines because of it's overall ease."
2,"I received this as a present and was convinced I wouldn't find a use for it.  Much to my surprise I love it!  It sets on the counter next to my DLC7-Pro.  It is a whiz for chopping a cup ful of nuts for a recipe. making quick bread crumbs for meatloaf. chopping herbs and making dressings.  The blade reverses for chopping or mixing so make sure to have the side up you want for the task at hand.  It is easy to use and a breeze to clean.  I just pop the soiled parts in the dishwasher and forget it.  I would not want to be a day with out this tiny wonder."
2,"This is a MINI processor. and that's why I bought it...NOT to do the big jobs. I have the 'big boy' to do that.  I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs. so I don't have to use the big one.  I use it a lot to make home made dressing.  Clean up is easy and quick. as is the machine.  It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices. etc. however...but it states that in the manual."
2,"I bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking. It does a fairly decent job with the spices although you need to have at least 1/4 cup for it to work well. As to the herbs perhaps I'm doing something wrong but it did not do as well. The herbs that were above the blade stayed put and it took a lot of scraping the bowl to get them chopped up. An addition of something solid (perhaps an onion or a some butter) would probably take care of the problem but just the leaves on their own give this processor a hard time."
2,"I have had this cuisinart for about 2 years now. and it is still going strong.  I have been impressed by its ability to chew through large volumes of basil when making pesto. and small things like sesame seeds for making tahini.  It is also perfect for grinding cookies for pie crusts.  And the size means you don't have to be using a large volume to get great results.  I don't think this mini prep eliminates the usefulness of a full-size cuisinart. but it sure is much easier to clean up when you only need to process 1-2 cups of something."
2,"I find it a little difficult to get the get the consistency I want.  Some things get liquefied if the chunks are too big and I want to try for a little smaller.  What I wind up with is liquid -- but still with some chunks in it!  That. for me is not too bad; I just wanted it for small amounts where hand slicing/chopping wouldn't do the job.  I have had the Cuisinart Mini-Prep for three-and-a-half years and used it again. tonight. for the first time in two years!  Then I remembered why I had not used it.  The parts have too many small grooves and recesses which just do not wash cleanly -- easily.  After brushing and scrubbing the disassembled parts I find that to get off all the small smears of food I have to resort to Q-Tips to get the numerous little. tight angles and grooves clean.  It's a  hygiene horror!"
2,"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers. and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position. so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well. the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine. so it's useless.On top of the danger. it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!"
2,"I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming. A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s. That one lasted around 12 years(!!!) I just burned-out my second one: and now I'm here to buy my third! It's very easy to operate. even for a quad!!It really works fast and the processing mechanism is made well. I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds. and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy."
2,"Then go with the Ninja Master Prep. I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant. so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed. but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades. two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit."
2,"I wore out my original one. so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads. and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad. I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor. and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you. and I like small pieces of carrot in salads. not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces. dressing. and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one. except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking."
2,"I love this little guy!  I use it for just about everything!  I make salad dressing all the time. and yesterday I made topping for a cherry crumble.  Easy to use. easy to clean!  I never put any of the parts in the dishwasher. I think its ok to do so. but from past experience. these sort of items tend to wear out more quickly if they are subject to the heat of dishwasher drying. so I don't do it.  This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.  Great for gifts too!"
2,"Cuisinart. I thought. built quality products. Then they started manufacturing this mess that they call a blender. What a stretch to call it a blender! It needs help to puree the ingredients for a smoothie (you must frequently STIR the ingredients yourself.) The blade assembly eventually cracked. There is now a black residue around the black whirly thing on the base. My husband thinks that it over heated. All that damage from making SMOOTHIES?! Yep. Cuisinart take note-I AM NOT BUYING CUISINART PRODUCTS AGAIN. I would venture to guess others feel the same. I'm happy that some folks had a good experience with this 'blender' but I am not one of them."
2,"In my humble opinion. most of blenders are not great.  The motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit. I've burned through a couple of cheap Hamilton Beach ones.  So if you are doing a lot of entertaining. you might want to look at a commercial one.Use your head.  You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down. Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients. Also. you should look at the recipe book.  The recipe book gives you hints on how to 'layer' the ingredients.I made some awesome hummus by following their directions.As I said earlier. if you are doing heavy blending work with ice you may need a professional unit.  I have heard some of the high end Warings fit the bill."
2,"I'd lower my number of stars. but can't because this is an edit of a previous review.  I had this blender for four years (an admittedly long time. but I used it very rarely).  I noticed after a year or so that there were fine black plastic bits on the base of the blender.  After a few more years of use the plastic mechanism in the base of the unit that spins the blades split in two.My husband and I were going to throw it in the trash. but then felt a wave of guilt about how in our consumeristic culture we never repair things anymore. etc.  So he went online and ordered the broken part for $[...].  When he tried to replace it we realized that an interior screw had become stripped and it was impossible to remove the broken piece.  THEN we threw it in the trash and bought an Osterizer. which doesn't have any plastic moving parts."
2,"I love the blender portion.  It works great at crushing ice and other items.  The food processor is another story.  Works to chop up and blend items. but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it.  With each use. the noise is louder and so irritating.  I am extremely disappointed that I can't use the processor portion of it.  As much as I love the blender. I can't recommend the purchase because you won't be able to use the processor without ear plugs."
2,"This blender replaced a Sunbeam I had for 30 years.  The jar is oversized and supported by small blades placed in a small opening at the base of vessel. isolated from the mass inside. It takes forever to blend anything smooth.  After operating the motor for more than a few moments it begins to emit a strong burning smell.  The plastic drive assembly for the blades snapped off in the first week of use.  Cuisinart replaced one free.  The second one cost about twenty dollars.  I would not recommend this blender. there are better choices."
2,"This is a great blender that's gotten a bad rap. I've owned this model for years and it outperforms all others for my specific task: pureeing Progresso's Manhattan Clam Chowder. The ice crushers don't liquefy the clam pieces. The Cuisinart purees their little hearts out. The mechanical construction is still the Achilles heel but if I can get 2-3 years daily service for 59 bucks. I'm good.Btw. Progresso Manhattan Clam Chowder is a watery mess from the can. Once it's throughly blended. like a shrimp bisque. it's a world class soup. I'd put it up against anything in a top restaurant. I've had one can a day for twenty years. Unfortunately. this doesn't work for other Progresso soups (they're already too thick). Another stroke of genius: blending pea soup with vegetable soup. but this only works for mid-price restaurant soups."
2,"Worked great for the three months that it functioned.  I liked the glass jar and it made great smoothies.  It was powerful and never bogged down.  Then it just quit working.  It is made in China and of apparently poor quality.  Too expensive to buy one every three months.  I would look for something with better reviews.I changed my review on this from one star to four stars because the manufacturer stands by there product.  They replaced the blender with no hassles.  However. it still broke after three months so you should be careful."
2,"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry). we did not have 'proof of purchase' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer 'service' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service."
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
2,"Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker. With a only 6 months of service. the grind mechanism bound and couldn't be removed. Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee (I did have to pay shipping charges!) Less than a year later a repeat performance. Again. I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine. Well you know what happened!  The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita's!"
2,"I've had two of these machines.  The first one lasted almost 2 years and made outstanding coffee.  The second one makes absolutely terrible coffee.  I have come to the conclusion that this second machine doesn't get the water hot enough so the coffee is weak and bitter no matter what I do.  The temp in the carafe at the conclusion of brewing is only 150 degrees.  I spent so much time and money thinking it was my error. but now I'm fairly sure it isn't my fault.If you get a good one it's great. but the one I have now makes undrinkable coffee.  I bought a refurbished one the second time around. I'll never make that mistake again.  There's a reason why those products are so much cheaper."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
2,"This coffee maker makes good coffee. but all the little parts. which don't fit together quite right will make you crazy.  This is a pain to clean.  The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove.  After a few months. I couldn't get it out. even with a pliers.  Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off. when trying to remove the basket.  I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response.  Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good.  In the trash it goes.  The machine also 'beeps' at you a lot....like I need one more complaint!  Good coffee. but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement."
2,"FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder. be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer."
2,"I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range. It does take longer to clean. I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts. I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away. One should use soap vs. just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils. Then if I want a second pot. I either use the other set of parts or if both sets are wet. I dry the pieces with a couple of papertowels. This probably takes 2-4 minutes. I think it's worth the time."
2,"The idea of a machine that ground &amp; brewed coffee was too good to resist. and for a while it was fine (althought it's noise scared the heck out of my dog);  within the first year the heating element croaked.  Sent it back &amp; got a replacement unit. which incidentally only is warranteed for the balance of the first unit's warranty!  6 months later. today. with a full pot of coffee on board. it burst into flame!  Whoa! Fortunately my husband was in the kitchen and took care of it before the house went up. I'm going back to Braun. no question!!"
2,"Worked great for the first year we had it. when we used it maybe 3-4 times.But after that. it seemed like nothing would ever really freeze up enough. I looked into the problem and decided that I might have damaged the cooling capability of the bowl by cleaning it with hot water (which is a no-no).So. I bought a replacement bowl. and once again. for the first year with a few uses it seemed to be OK.But now once again. it's just not getting cold enough - and this time I *know* it's not my fault since I have been very careful to only wash the bowl in cold water."
2,"I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot. Although it is super easy to use. it is not really a practical gadget for regular use. The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance. The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath. Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors. dieters. or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar). I usually make mango ice cream in it. In addition to ice-cream. it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks. In  that case you will want to get an extra canister."
2,"I really wanted to love this ice cream maker.  I was Somersizing and wanted to use the all natural ice cream mixes that went along with the diet.  I could get my ice cream to freeze- that wasn't a problem. It was like wonderful soft serve in the middle of the bowl.  However. all along the edges of the bowl it was frozen rock solid and NOTHING was going to remove the ice cream from around it.  The ring of rock hard ice cream wasn't just a small skim. it was a substantial amount.  Sadly. this has spent more time hidden in the depths of my cabinets than being used."
2,"My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago. My husband and I are vegan. so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes. (I eventually started compiling them in my blog. A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.)We've never had a problem with the machine. Every recipe I've invented has frozen nicely. I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time. so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe. because it can be a pain to clean. especially when I'm using a high-fat coconut milk. Still. it's not too difficult. and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it."
2,"Once I got the hang of it (there is a bit of a learning curve. but it's not terribly steep). I loved the frozen treats that I could make - especially frozen yogurt.A few weeks ago. while it was mid way thru churning. the upper. cylindrical part of the dasher snapped away from the vertical. scraping arm.  Because the machine is out of warranty. I had to order the part's replacement at my own expense.  While it's not going to break the bank. Cuisinart informed me that it would take 8 weeks (!) to fill my order.I'd considered ordering the dasher that was introduced in the newer model. since it's supposed to be more efficient. but I wasn't sure that it would fit in the ICE-20.Bottom Line:  Great concept. lousy parts."
2,"This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.  No more messing with salt and ice cubes--this maker has a special bowl that you keep in the freezer that freezes the ingredients (mine is always frozen so whenever I want to make ice cream I can). This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make 'frozen ANYTHING' with this maker.  Did you know that you could make frozen pudding? The ice cream technique that Cuisinart has perfected of a constant scraping of the sides of the bowl assures that your ice cream is super smooth too. Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.  Great machine!  I've had mine for about six years and use it about once a month and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it."
2,"First let me start by saying I was a little skeptical of ice cream makers. The ones we had when we were kids required dry ice and lots of time. neither of which I have.  This is the best though.  The ice cream is so good and really easy.  I've only had this ice cream maker 4 days and I've already made vanilla. chocolate and strawberry ice cream and peach frozen yogurt and each one is delicious.  It makes the perfect amount for a family. not too much so you're sick of it before it's gone or too little.  And it's so easy.  Basically you just pour the ingredients in while it's mixing and in 30 minutes you have ice cream."
2,"I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock. and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all. but I've really been craving sorbet. and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix. but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours. only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up."
2,"I have had an old Donvier manual model for 30 years. so I'm used to using a chiller bowl.  However. there's no comparison between hand turning the paddle in the Donvier model and letting the Cuisinart do it's thing. I love the fact that the chiller turns and the paddle is stationary.I leave the chiller in the freezer for 1-2 days and make sure my ice cream bases are nice and cold as well.  My ice cream is ready in about 12-13 minutes.  So easy. creamy. fast and smooth. Love. love. love this Cuisinart.I debated on whether to get the 2 qt model or the 1 1/2. My old Donvier makes 2 qts. I opted for the 1 1/2 qt and find that's plenty of ice cream.  Thinking about buying a 2nd chiller for times when I do want to make more than 1 1/2 qts or when I want to make 2 different types of ice cream on the same day.So glad I bought this!Farewell Donvier!"
2,"I had never in my life had homemade ice cream until now. my husband and I bought this as a Christmas present to the both of us. we have everything else you can think of but never an ice cream maker. well we are so impressed with the ice cream we can't wait to try other types. It is without a doubt the best tasting ice cream I have ever had. and this machine makes it so easy to make. just pour in the ingredients and turn it on. set a timer and you can relax. when it is done transfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and let it harden and you have the best tasting ice cream ever! Try it. you will love it!"
2,"I had used an old ice cream maker for years. but got tired of the ice and salt mess. so was using the maker less and less. Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews. I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok. especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well. let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold. it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency. but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!"
2,"We've had this Cuisinart ice cream maker for several months now and have made many different flavors of ice cream.  Without exception the product has been excellent.  I've read some earlier reviews where the reviewer had a problem with the ice cream being too soft.  We have neve experienced this problem.  When it is initially finished it is not as hard as when purchased in a store.  However. merely by placing in the freezer. where ice cream belongs in the first place. it hardens to regular consistency.  Perhaps the reason is that we use the Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream book (available from Amazon).I could not expect or experience a better product for making any kind of ice cream."
2,"I make Raw Cream Ice Cream twice a week.  It works great.  It makes 6 cups.  I need 2 for parties.  Don't over fill and run till it's hard and it's firmer than soft serve.I get 5 cups of cream per gallon of Raw Milk. straight from the mamma cow.  I add 6 Raw Free-Range Egg Yokes. a 1/4 cup of Maple Syrup. 2 1/2 tablespoons of Vanilla Extract and 1 tablespoon of Psyllium Husks.  It's so healthy.  I consider it medicine for my 3 year boy.I find that it does stick to the bowl some.  It's not a problem unless you put it back in the freezer with ice cream in it.  I only do that when I'm leaving soon after making ice cream.  It's not totally quiet. but what do you expect from a motor.  It's quieter than the old salt and ice type."
2,"I received this for my bridal shower.  I tried it to make sure it worked before I lost the gift receipt.  It is so easy to use.  I made up a batch of ingredients to make vanilla frozen yogurt.  It was quick and easy to assemble.  I poured the liquid in and off it went for 20-25 minutes.  It was louder then I anticipated. but nothing crazy.  It froze perfectly and tasted wonderful.  I am looking forward to making more delicious ice creams. sorbets. sherbets. frozen yogurts. and even frozen slushy drinks.  This thing is awesome.  It seems pretty darn solid and it easy to clean."
2,"I bought this for me last summer. and I loved it so much. I bought another as a gift.  It's easy. taste so much better than anything you can buy. and it's fun to be creative.  We never have left over icecream sitting in the freezer now. and when we want some. I keep cream handy in the fridge. so we just toss the ingredients into a blender. pour it into the already frozen bowl. and 'Voila' 30 minutes later we have icecream !!!  Fastest dessert I've ever made. and always a big hit.  Great way to use up ripe bananas. and make banana split ice cream."
2,"I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice cream maker and would highly recommend it to anyone. I have made countless different recipes in it. and this machine makes creamy ice cream in mere minutes. I have also partly frozen the ice cream and then layered a combination of flavors creating a stunning semifredo dessert. When you can get Cuisinart quality at such a reasonable price. why pay more? The only problem I had was that the ice cream was so good I wanted to make more shortly after and the freezer bowl had not completely frozen again. An additional freezer bowl is on my Christmas wish list this year!"
2,"I bought this because I love ice cream and can't have many of the 'preservatives' in store brands and I can't afford the price of high end natural ice creams. Thinking worse case scenario the grandkids would love it I made my first batch of ice cream using fat free half and half. it was amazing!As for the noise it makes. I discovered that setting it on a folded towel on the counter cuts down on the noise alot. My husbands plan is setting it up in the laundry room. closing the door and setting a time. lol that works too.I usually only have to place container in the frezer for 6 hours before using it so I think freezing time depends on type of freezer and settings.What I like teh most is how easy it is to make ice cream and the clean up is also fast and easy.I'm getting each of my adult children one for Christmas gifts this year."
2,"Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [...]and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it. my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one. so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced"
2,"i gave this to my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it. once you put all the stuff in the bowl it only takes 15 minutes. though it should be noted that it then needs a few hours in the freezer to freeze up fully and that many recipes require a little prior prepping. i still think this is the easiest one you will find and it's a big plus to not need ice or salt. very easy to clean and there is an opening at the top so you can watch it work. very cool."
2,"Awesome product... just make sure that your freezer bowl is frozen solid... leave it in your freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 days between ice cream batches just to be sure.  Also. you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine.  My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been.  Other than that. its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream.  If you really like ice cream or have a large family. you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl.  The ice cream will go fast!"
2,"I received this item for Christmas.  I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives.  I used a simple recipe from off the web: Some whole milk. condesed milk. and cocoa powder.  At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours.  It didn't swish when I shook it. so I thought I was good to go.  After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants.  I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning.  After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had.  I will never buy ice cream from the store again.  This ice cream maker is awesome. I love it."
2,"We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make 'Ice Cream' with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.  We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry 'ice cream' using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first."
2,"Highly recommended! I LOVE this ice cream maker. It's so easy and the results are amazing. I like GOOD ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs)and this machine creates stellar ice cream. It rivals any of the best ice cream you can find. Even the basic recipes produce excellent ice cream. I've made mint chip. premium vanilla bean and strawberry. I do recommend using quality dairy products for best results (I use Organic Valley milk and heavy cream). Sorry. Haagen-Dazs. I won't be buying any more ice cream from you!"
2,"This is a very simple machine that does what it's supposed to with very little fuss.  I put the frozen bowl part in our upright freezer at least a few hours before I expect to make ice cream.  I make the custard for the ice cream at the same time.  After dinner. I put the frozen part on the stand. put in the mixing blade and top with the lid.  Then I pour the custard in and 20-30 minutes later we enjoy fresh ice cream with no additives.  If you want ice cream that is harder than soft serve. it will need to 'ripen' a bit more in your freezer.  But this is a delightful machine that I highly recommend.  I never made ice cream before it. and never want to buy it from a grocery again."
2,"This product is getting great reviews for good reason. Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way. First. freeze the bowl overnight. Second. chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled. Use pure vanilla. not imitation vanilla extract. In doing both of these things. I've found I've been able to create soft serve ice cream. which I then freeze for a couple of hours for a hard serve. In not doing these things. I've found that I create milkshakes. and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants. To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie. Amazingly. the recipes in the instruction manual show sorbet and frozen yogurt are on par calorically with homemade ice cream at about 215 calories per 1/2 cup serving. Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly. and I'll experiment with those recipes."
2,"This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours. I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours. At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture. Obviously it was not frozen enough. At 12 hours. I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen. This may not be an issue for everyone. but with our freezer and our bowl it takes a good 20 to 24 hours of the bowl being in the freezer to get the icecream just right."
2,"I actually have the red model with 2 freezer inserts.  It's a very simple machine with only 4 parts and is easy to clean.  The only thing you have to remember is to keep the freezer inserts in the freezer and that the ice cream will be soft when finished churning.  I put my finished ice cream in containers in the freezer and they're ready to eat in a couple of hours.  I wasn't all that happy with the recipes I found in the booklet (didn't want to use heavy cream or cook the base) but there are skazillions of recipes on line and after some trial and error I made up my own.  I saw some people complained of the noise. but it's not all that loud and it only churns for 30 minutes.  Here's the link to my ice cream recipe (makes 2 inserts worth of ice cream) if you're interested.  [...]  I am very happy with this purchase."
2,"I bought this ice cream maker after I took an Ice Cream. Gelato and Sorbet class at Sur La Table cooking store.  Because we were making so many different types of desserts. we had several ice cream makers working in the classroom at the same time.  This ice cream maker was by far my favorite that day and I bought it about a week later.I liked the ease of adding ingredients through the opening on the top and the size is perfect for me.I have used my new ice cream maker with no problems.  The bowl froze easily (probably in less than 24 hours) in the bottom and back of the freezer.  Within about 20 minutes. I had wonderfully frozen ice cream.I certainly plan on getting more adventurous with my ingredients and do not anticipate any problems with this wonderful machine."
2,"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also. I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender. pour it into the frozen bowl. turn it on. & 25 minutes later. you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night."
2,"I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go. I really like how fast it makes ice cream. I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out. Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl. So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream. The texture is just right when its finished. I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer. So I put it into individual portions and that way I don't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy"
2,"I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use. makes great ice cream. and the design is simple. so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price. and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content. you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this. I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use. easy to clean. simple design. great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space"
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
2,"Without a doubt. this is a great appliance!  Mine was a gift. but Amazon's price is the best (as is the service).  It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer.  Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid.  Perhaps their freezers need adjusting?  In fact. after making ice cream (about 20 minutes) my bowl is still mostly frozen.Recipes do not seem to be as important as when baking. so don't be afraid to try something innovative.  Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it. then improvise.We are healthy eaters.  It's nice to know the ingredients I'm using are healthy.  It's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun!"
2,"I and my family have had a blast with this ice cream maker! We have been making up some of our own recipes as well as using those supplied with the machine and some from Ben & Jerry's recipe book. The savings over store bought ice cream is phenomenal too. I only have one small exception to our 'eye blasting red' ice cream maker (and it is indeed a small exception). It could be perhaps be a bit quieter... On the other hand. it is readily apparent by the change in the 'noise' the machine makes. that your delectable treat is ready to decant!GET IT. MAKE IT. LOVE IT...  then do it again!"
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"I just received this yesterday. and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt.  I was a little apprehensive. since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.  My first batch worked flawlessly!  The machine was quiet. operated smoothly. and it was soooo simple!  I am going to buy an extra freezing cannister so we can do two batches back-to-back.  We've been using our old electric rock salt machine. but now we'll probably get rid of it.  Also. due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker. we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.  I recommend it."
2,"Can I say more?  Well. this neat little ice cream maker doesn't take up much space on the counter when in use &amp; stores easily -- the base is no wider in diameter than a dinner plate.  The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid. After having it in the freezer overnight. when it's thoroughly frozen. you put it on the base. fill it with the ingredients for whatever flavor of ice cream you desire. put the mixing blade in and the top on then flip the switch. About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple. You can cover the original container and slip it in the freezer for later. or you can dish it out and wash and refreeze the container -- it is very easy to clean. Also. by the way. it's the best ice cream you'll ever have. Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry."
2,"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar. but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said. you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir. and then take the freezer bowl out. cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great. I have very little problem with ice crystals forming."
2,"I've had my Cuisinart ice cream maker for 5 years now and am still delighted with it!  I even bought an extra freezer bowl in case I want to make 2 flavors the same day.  I do make sure to stop the freezer after 20-25 minutes of operation or the ice cream will start to soften.  And I learned early on to chill the ingredients OVERNIGHT or the ice cream won't freeze - just gets thick.  But it's a great item. and doesn't take up much space on the counter. I'm especially happy with it since I can't eat regular ice cream because of lactose intolerance.  So I use liquid nondairy creamer to make ice cream in this freezer and it's very satisfactory!"
2,"... is home-made ice cream. I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit. No mess. quick. easy. home made ice cream. Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted. Great for frozen drinks. too. including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction. powerful motor. It's noisy but not too much.The ice cream from this (or any) ice cream maker comes out soft serve. but it's really true. if you put the ice cream in the freezer for another 1-2 hours. it hardens to the exact same consistency as store-bought ice cream. It's surprising the first time you try this. because you think it'll come out solid like a block of ice. but it doesn't - it's soft but scoopable."
2,"I ordered the Cuisinart Ice Cream maker after reading all of the reviews on Amazon and it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  To be honest. I thought that making home-made ice cream would be just too  difficult. but with the Cuisinart. I've made it three times in the past  week.  You simple mix-up the ingredients. chill. and then pour into the  pre-frozen bowl.  Perfect every time.  I highly recommend the book.  &quot;Gelato! : Italian Ice Cream. Sorbetti &amp; Granite&quot; by Pamela  Sheldon Johns as a great add-on.  I ordered the book with the hope of being  able to duplicate the Stracciatella(?) Gelato I had while on vacation in  Italy.  The recipe was simple (heavy cream. milk. sugar. vanilla. and  shaved chocolate) and the results were fabulous.This machine would  make a great gift as well!"
2,"Soft serve at best is what this unit does. I followed the instructions to the letter. The freezer container was kept at 0 degrees for &#62;24 hours. The mix was kept in the frid for 6 hours to hopefully assist in keeping things cold. The unit works well and within 15 minutes I had a nice batch of soft serve. However all the unit does is save you the trouble of mixing the batch by hand. I think Ice Cream means it shouldn't flow out of the container until it melts. This it pour-able into a dish. On a hot day of say 85 degrees. this wouldn't last long enough to lick a cone of it before it was running down your arm. I can deal with hand mixing from now on and placing the batch in the freezer and waiting."
2,"This was a good purchase and the recipe book is great! I've made half of them now; some were awesome. some good. some didn't work. The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so. which I found strange. An ice cream maker shouldn't get hot! The ice cream is still really yummy. but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks. Overall. for $60. it does the job and there haven't been any major problems!"
2,"I ordered this RED ice cream maker to give to my husband's daughter and family for Christmas along with a RED quesadilla maker.  I ordered the Cuisinart because a friend has the stainless one and really brags about it - makes ice cream 2 or 3 times a week - says it is EASY and GOOD!  I just know that they will have a great family time together making ice cream with the RED ice cream maker and the color couldn't be any better for a Christmas gift!  And - yes - I shop early so there's not such a rush around Christmas time!"
2,"LOVE this ice cream maker.  I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are. Doesn't take up much room. It's the perfect size for my husband and me.  Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.  IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things. like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.  I admit I wasn't sure it would work the first time. it seemed too easy. but sure enough in 25 minutes we were in ice cream heaven.  We like to transfer the ice cream to a tupperware container and stick it in the freezer for an hour or so before eating so it's firmer. but if we can't wait....  I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.  We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something."
2,"Yes. upfront I'll say it's a little noisy. but that kind of goes with the territory.  Works perfectly. just as described in the directions.  I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.  It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.  Makes great ice cream. ice milk. bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.  Once you do that you may never make it any other way.  Once you price the ingredients. I cannot honestly say making ice cream is all that much cheaper than buying it. but the quality is far superior to store bought. and you have the added bonus of knowing exactly what is in your ice cream."
2,"I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far.  3 were from the manual that came with the machine. and one was from the internet.  All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture.  The ice cream was not creamy and melty. it was either icy or fudgy.  I like the machine. it is easy to use. but also quite loud.  We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned.  I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people don't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well.  The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream. but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it."
2,"This Product turned out to be what I expected based on other's reviews.but it does what it says if you follow the directions carefully.The only thing is that it does not get the ice cream to a solid texture.like soft serve as other's have said.so you can freeze it more within a few hours if preferred as I did.It is slightly noisy but it does not bother me.sound can be compared to a blow dryer on low perhaps but not exact.Other than that minor issue it works pretty good and I intend to use it plenty.also I was glad to purchase it in my favorite color red."
2,"Makes ice cream! I am on a no carb diet.. but I didn't want to give up my favorite frozen treat. This makes ice cream.. takes maybe 20 minutes.. the ice cream holder itself requires about 24hrs to freeze prior to use. You can of course use it before 24 hours.. but its more like a milkshake.. which is also fine  :)I have never used an ice cream maker before this one. My boyfriend has a self refrigerating one.. he said this one is A LOT quieter.I love it."
2,"Will never buy ice cream again!!  At first was hesitant bytthe few negative reviews.  Bought one two days ago and bought a load of milk and supplies cause figured it would take 5 or 6 times to get it right.  have made 4 ice creams already.  So far they have all turned out GREAT!  have always loved soft serve better.  used mostly the recipes that came with the machine except that being lactose intolerant. i used lactaid milk and also used baking splenda instead of sugar.  It worked out fine. But. i did make sure all the ingredients were real cold before i put them into the machine.  and also i put the 2 bowls into the chest freezer in plastic bags.  We are real happy with this for sure."
2,"We were initially disappointed with this machine.  We tried recipes out of the booklet that came with it. the Ben & Jerry's book and another source.  The ice cream was just OK.  Something along the line of what we could pick up at the local convenience store.  Then we tried the recipe out of Christopher Kimball's The Desert Bible.  Hallelujah!  Creamy. rich. just what we had hoped for.We had a similar experience with our bread machine.  Mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook.  So. don't blame the machine too quickly.  The fault may lie in the recipe book."
2,"I bought this because my son was diagnosed with a dairy allergy.  I wanted to be able to provide ice cream without breaking the bank.  There are new coconut milk ice creams available but at $6 a pint I could pay for this unit in a hurry.  I buy my Thai brand Coconut Milk (not lite) from Walmart at $1.42 per can.  You just freeze the cylander. add 2 cans of coconut milk. a little sugar. vanilla and whatever else you want to flavor and let it go.  1/2 hour later I had what looked like soft serve ice cream.  My children were so thrilled!"
2,"If you think that you cannot make good ice cream without the rock salt and a ton of ice. well you should check out this Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker!  It is so easy and convenient to use. and in 20-25 minutes you have soft serve ice cream.  If you want to freeze it hard. just put it in the freezer for awhile if there is any left after you taste your results over and over again!  Also. if you make a lot of ice cream. be sure to pick up the extra freezer container.  Keep one in the freezer at all times and you are never caught without one that is ready to go!"
2,"I've only used this once so far. but it's pretty awesome.  You just pour in your pre-mixed. chilled ingredients. press start. and set a kitchen timer.  20-30 minutes later. the ice cream comes out like soft serve. which is great. but you can pour it into a freezer container and firm it up if you'd like. (which I did because it was for a birthday party later in the day).  My only complaint is that it's a little noisy.  I wouldn't recommend running it while you're trying to watch a movie or something.  I'm looking forward to using this more when the weather warms up here in Michigan."
2,"This is very easy to use; it's just like another small appliance you can use on your counter top.  It does a good job. except that a hard frozen layer forms around the sides and needs to be scraped down about halfway through.I'm updating this since I've had it a few more months.  It still works great. and I've been able to experiment more.  Even if I don't get the recipie just right. it freezes just fine.  I use frozen berries to make sorbets with less sugar (high fructose corn syrup) than the grocery store kinds.  I've also made a batch of very rich vanilla (with eggs carefully cooked) and it came out wonderful."
2,"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list. and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was 'awesome.' I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise. but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet. but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender."
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
2,"This is my second summer using the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker. and it's never let me down.  Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite.  As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home. when the ice cream is done. it will . . . still be soft. but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable.  Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer.'  My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy. but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch--not too long to vacate the kitchen."
2,"I love this machine.  A cousin had tried a couple of other brands including one about 4 times more expensive and had to return both of them. so I read the reviews very carefully.  This one is easy to use and it works.  I followed the instructions exactly. The ice cream is great.  I did freeze the ice cream for an additional 2 hours after it was mixed as the manual suggests.  Works perfectly. Yumm  It doesn't make a lot. just a little over two pints."
2,"This machine is very easy to use.  It comes with a handy little recipe book to help you with your first few recipes.  One thing you must do is  freeze the bowl for a good 24 hours the first time. then you will want to  cover the bowl in plastic (to prevent freezer flavors tainting the bowl).  and leave it in your freezer.  You will be making home made ice cream in  about 20 minutes.  The consistancy is good. and it is delicous.  Best of  all. you will not be adding any strange presevatives. or anything you do  not want.  Ben and Jerry's has an excellent recipe book that you can get  here at amazon. and you will be making up tasty ice cream in no time!"
2,"I got one of these ice cream makers as a Christmas gift. and it's been fantastic. I was careful before requesting it to check the temperature of my freezer. If your freezer doesn't maintain a temperature of between 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit. your ice cream probably won't turn out that well. Mine stays at a chilly zero degrees. and I've been amazed at how quickly this machine makes great frozen desserts. I've made the full-fat ice creams. a couple of sherbets. and frozen yogurt -- everything froze quickly and evenly. and came out with fantastic texture and flavor. It's been a great gift. I keep the bowl in the freezer. wrapped in a plastic bag and filled with frozen vegetables. so it's always ready to go."
2,"I bought this for my son for his birthday.  Wow. is it easy and delicious.  A person could be in real trouble with this ice cream maker sitting around.We first made the vanilla recipe and it was better than wonderful...just a few ingredients into the bowl and away you go.  Fat City is on the horizon.  I love it.  Thank goodness my son lives 1000 miles away or I would be in real trouble with this little machine.  The price is good and the ice cream is wonderful.  Wonderful gift."
2,"I just got this machine and made the strawberry ice cream recipe that came with it.  Ben and Jerry. eat your heart out.  This is so easy there's no reason to ever eat store bought ice cream again.  No locust bean gum. no artificial color. no preservatives - and you can make it with organic ingredients if you want.  The ice cream tastes awesome. and I would recommend this machine to anyone. especially those who cannot use a hand crank machine. or don't want the fuss and muss of using salt."
2,"I read many of the reviews before buying this ice cream maker. and the reviewers were right!  It's a great little machine...I don't think it's that noisy (no more so than a food processor).  I love it - I do agree that the recipes that come with it are not great. but there are lots of wonderful recipes out there.  This is fast. easy. and no worries about salt and ice running all over make it much more likely I will continue to use it quite often!"
2,"I have always used my kitchen aid attachment for ice cream and am very happy with it; however. we don't eat a lot of ice cream and the Kitchen Aid bowl was too big.  I picked this up when I read some great reviews and I am very pleased.  The ice cream maker is very easy to use and while not as quiet as I hoped for. it doesn't take long to get great ice cream.  Note that what you first end up with is more soft serve which we really enjoy but after a few hours in the freezer you have more of an ice cream texture.  Great product - Cuisinart never lets me down!"
2,"I've just gotten this machine and have made the basic vanilla ice cream twice. Both times were a total sucess!  The ice cream is delicious!  No more ice and salt mess! Preparation time is quick and easy! The machine is a little noisy. however. no big deal. It was facinating watching it thicken up for the final result. Time in the freezer is usually needed after it's done.  That's the hardest part....the waiting!  Clean up time is quick as well! Looking forward to trying the other recipes in the booklet. I'm sure they'll be just as tasty.  I highly recommend this machine!!  I know that we'll be having home made ice cream a lot more often now!"
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
2,"I connected some quick disconnect fittings to this Y fitting. Two of the openings in this Y were the right size. but one opening was too large. I had to cut slots in the rim of the opening and use a hose clamp to bring the size down to the correct diameter. I verified the opening diameter with several other fittings and calipers to see that the one opening was indeed bigger than the normal size.This item will normally work great if you are connecting hose directly to it. but use caution when connecting other items to it.Plastic will change shape after it has been injected and cools (like this product). Good engineering and good chemical composition will compensate for those changes. I recommend getting a different brand product instead of this one if you want quality and consistency."
2,"I use the TN311C heavy-duty grounded timer to control the ON-OFF cycle of a dehumidifier.  I actually bought two units - the 2nd one as a back-up - and. removed all of the 'ON' and 'OFF' trippers from the back-up unit to use on this one.  This gives me 6 ON-OFF cycles. and it works perfectly with our dehumidifier.  I've set the timer to turn ON the dehumidifier for 2 hours and then OFF for 2 hours throughout the day and night.  It keeps our area perfectly dehumidified. and the humidity rise is only 4% to 5% during the OFF cycle.I would recommend this timer to anyone considering a use similar to mine."
2,"I have used a number of these for years with no problems whatsoever.  However I realized that the timers use more power than some of my lights!  I have a 4 Watt night light which we run all night in the hallway and the timer draws 5 Watts - 24x7.  That was bad enough. but then I replaced the 4 Watt night light with an LED bulb that draws 1/2 watt or so.  It was way cheaper to run that 24x7 then to use a timer to 'save money' and have it only on at night.  I have thrown these all away and purchased digital timers - they pay for themselves in energy savings."
2,"I've bought 2 of these exact same ones. one is still working & the other one went bad after3 or 4 years so that seemed reasonable.This one i just got yesterday from amazon doesn't work. The dial turns but it gets stuckat the pins. I noticed another reviewer had the same problem so I'm here to buy another brand.UPDATE: After i wrote the above I took the unit and kept spinning the dial to loosen it up.I plugged it back in & found it WOULD now turn on but not OFF. So i repeated spinning the dial over & over & finally. now it's working properly."
2,"I'd had these timers for years and had no problems. so the issue is not with the timer itself. BUT now that I have a TODDLER. these really can't be used anymore. since she finds it fun to pull out the little plastic pieces that are needed to set the timer. Not only is this a choking hazard (however minor). but once the pieces are gone. the timer is useless! CAUTION WITH DIGITAL TIMERS. TOO. THOUGH (though I'll have to try them again): We had a power surge. and all of the timers got ruined (and we tried to change the batteries - no help)! SO. OVERALL A GOOD PRODUCT AND MORE RELIABLE THAN DIGITAL TIMERS. but NOT good if you have toddlers!"
2,"This is a nice window fan with good power and not too noisy. adaptable to different window sizes if you need to move it. However. the sliding panels are flimsy and don't move smoothly; the fasteners that are used to clamp the panels in place are cheap and can easily be unscrewed and fall out.  The single knob control works fine but the settings are hard to see; you will end up turning it by click or fan noise to the desired power or direction. Well-packaged in the box."
2,"This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues. but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy. but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws. so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you. put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable. but it exhausts air much better than it draws air. and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed. which is how we run it anyway."
2,"I have a Lasko fan that I bought around 1989 which still runs and I live in an apartment on the second floor that gets very hot in the summer so I decided to get another fan to have cross ventilation. I am really pleased with my purchase. this fan is lighter and easier to place in the window and you don't need to screw it in the window for it to stay in. It is much quieter than the older fan even on high speed and doesn't shake in the window like the older model does.I like the fan so much that I plan on purchasing another one next month and give the older model to a friend."
2,"We raise & show rabbits so we bought this fan for our rabbit barn because the ammonia smell was getting really bad in there & we needed something to pull that smell out. The barn isn't real big so there's wasn't enough air flow in there with only 1 window & 1 door so... needless to say we are VERY pleased with this exhaust fan!!! We keep the fan on exhuast 24/7 & you would never know that rabbits lived in there! It gets the smell out seconds after turning it on. I love that you can put it in the window & still be able to close the window behind it during bad weather. I was surprised at how inexpensive this fan was too! Definitely worth buying! & If something were to happen to the one we have we will definitely be buying another one!"
2,"I searched for an exhaust fan for our new. hot garage.  I did not believe some of the negative reviews and neither should you!  This fan fit right into our garage window and has been working every day for months!  Who cares if it is not made out of a heavy metal; you don't have to touch it except to turn it off and on.  It pulls and exhausts a lot of air and that is what it is supposed to do.  Don't make life more complicated then it has to be.  With all my searching. Amazon gave me the best deal and with my rewards from my Amazon credit card the fan cost me $54.  What's not to like when other stores wanted as much as $110?"
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
2,"This fan is a good fan but does not move the amount of air I want to move.  I usually put a fan at one end of the house then open my bedroom window and have the fan pull in cool air at night.  this somewhat does the  job but really not enough.  I might be asking for too much for its size etc.  I like the fact that it is reversable and it is adjustable to fit wide or narrow windows.  If you are using it for one room this is a good fan but not great for the whole house (I have a small house 1500 sq ft).  I'd give it a try and see if it works for you."
2,"These are great fans--I bought one for the upstairs hall. and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home.  WIth both of them running on exhaust. the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night.  There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though.  I had no choice but to mount the fan on  the inner window frame for both windows. because the extensions do not reach far enough to mount on the outside of the window frame.  The windows cannot be shut with the fan mounted. because they have a 'lip' at the bottom. that overhangs a bit and runs the length of the window. to make opening and closing easier.  The lip interferes with the window closing while the fan is in place. so the fan must be removed from the mount if heavy rain is expected (Hurricane Irene. for instance!)  Even so. the fan is easily removed. once the screws are in place."
2,"Probably the best available today. but. certainly not like the old metal ones. It fits where and how I want it to go and will do the job.It's got some sharp plastic edges on the inside. Sliced a finger reaching in to slide the side panels to fit.Low and medium speeds don't move much air and the small motor whines a bit on high. Fortunately I don't have to be in the room with it when it's on high.It does a much better job than the Holmes dual window fan I was using but I do long for the old metal King Air 20' I had years ago. That was a window fan."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
2,"There are too many reviews already to fret over one detail or another. so here's my brief take: my fan is well balanced. no perceptible wobbling or shaking at any speed.  The blades spin freely suggesting little bearing drag to strain the motor.  I found that it easily fits several of my windows without actually mounting it (i.e.. installing the four screws that come with it).  That's a plus for me because I may want to use it in different rooms at different times - I can just set it in a window when needed. then remove it when I want it elsewhere or not at all.  My wattage meter says it uses about 63W on low and 78W on medium (very quiet at both low and medium speeds) and about 110W on high (noticeably louder than low/medium but not at all intrusive or annoying in my view).  If my house were bigger I'd buy another.  Good stuff."
2,"I'm so happy we have this fan!!!1. We turn it on &#34;reverse&#34; in the evening. drawing the cool air into our hot bedroom and it cools down the room a solid 10 degrees almost immediately.2. We leave it on all night in the reverse setting and it's completely changed our sleep pattern for the better. It keeps our room cool and drones out the loud road noise.3. I love having the option of having the window open still with the fan off and a soft breeze.4. The unit is not very attractive so we have a cafe curtain in front of it. When we turn it on. the curtain just blows upward and is not in the way.5. Install it on a window with a screen. We originally tried a different room. an old double hung window with no screen. and we woke up to a flying insect massacre on the floor. They were sucked in and didn't have a chance."
2,"Having a small kitchen and not a great exhaust. solutions like fan windows are great. but all too often they are small and have to sit below the window. That means that when it rains or cold out. you have to remove the fan to close the window. This fan stays in the window year round but allows you to open and close the window without having to remove the fan!  Not only that. it's very powerful and VERY quiet.  Cooking smells are eliminated very fast with the three speed reversible motor. I even let my smoking friends sit at the table when they light up because not a particle of smoke enters the house with this fan running.It's a great solution for us and I'm on my second year of using it."
2,"I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up."
2,"...for a fan that could pull air thru the whole house. but did not want to pay $200 for one.  This seems to have done the job.  I used it this past hot summer (2012) as an exhaust fan to move air in the house and to get it cooled off in the evening.  This machine seems to have done it. quietly...quieter that I thought it would be.  It is a two-directional fan. so you can bring air in or pull it out.  It also has 3 speeds. I used the medium speed all summer. 24/7.  No problems to report. would buy another.  I don't have AC here so this was it. and it stood the test. Recommended..."
2,"Really. this is close to an ideal fan if you want a window fan. The biggest issue is the way the fan mounts to the window frame. When you do it correctly it is secure. but not tight. There is just enough play in the way it mounts (drops down on screws) that there is a rattle when the fan is on. This was dealt with easily enough with some foam tape. but the tape needs occasional fixes.The ability to close the window while the fan is on. and reverse the airflow is great. For our apartment (1200sf) this fan can make a noticeable difference in temperature and air quality in about 5-10 minutes depending on the fanspeed. This is way more effective than sitting a box fan at the window because the airflow HAS to go through the window instead of cycling back into the fan."
2,"I needed a good window fan to keep the air moving in my country cottage. I am able to limit the use of A/C if I have a means for proper ventilation. This fan satisfies that need.It was fairly easy to install but still required a bit of ingenuity as the side panels were a bit of a challenge. They will slide but be patient because they will also break if forced.  The fan is very quiet. emitting a hum rather than a roar when running at full speed.I will leave the fan in the window for the entire season so I will not have to struggle with the side panels again until it is time to remove it."
2,"I installed this on a horizantaly sliding window.  It probably took about 10 to 20 minutes to install.  Its just 4 screws. It comes with a guide for the position of the screws which helped. It works awesome. You even have to put a door stop infront of a door in a beadroom if you have the fan in the room blowing the air in. otherwise its strong enough to slam your door shut. We liked it so much so that we bought a second one and installed it in the kitchen to clear the air when we are cooking.  we will usually put the fans on exaust and open up the living room window and it pulls in a strong breese with them both sucking the air thru the house.I can't recommend them enough. we wish we got them years ago!!!  Just make sure you open another window in the house so the air has somewhere to go."
2,"I bought an Air King 20' (same manufacturer of the Lasko) whole house fan a couple of years ago and it proved to be too much fan for my &lt; 2000 sq. ft. condo. I went for this 16' and it does the job just as quietly as the 20'. Very easy to install within the window frame and no vibration. I only wish that the side extenders were metal like they are on the Air King. The grill on the front of the fan is metal. I am very happy with this purchase and that's why it gets FIVE STARS. These are both excellent. high quality fans and I would not hesitate to purchase again."
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
2,"I bought my windmachine after my smaller honeywell fan finally died after a number of years.  In truth. I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night.  To that end. it's been perfect.  It's a powerful fan. so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise.  Note that this is not a small fan.  It's just shy of 2' tall. so while the handle on top makes it portable. and it's built to stand on the floor. it's not made for a tiny bedroom.  The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room. I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool.  I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I'm still very happy with it a year later!  Included 2 images for a visual."
2,"Before I finally installed air conditioning. I used this fan. In fact. I had two of them and used them for several years.This is the most powerful fan I've ever had. It doesn't rattle or clang like metal window fans. It really stirs up the air and cools the room.The three settings - low. medium and high - are achieved by turning a huge and easy to turn knob. You can tilt the fan up or down and than lock it into position using the knobs on the side. By placing one fan upward and another downward you'll get a wonderful and refreshing cross breeze.If you can't afford air conditioning or you live in an area that only needs a fan. you will love the WindMachine. I still use mine to dry clothes that I don't want to place in the drier. I hang them over the shower rod and turn the fans setting to high. The clothes are dry within a couple of hours."
2,"This is the second Wind Machine that I've owned. our first one just stopped working after almost 10 years.  We use ours almost exclusively in our very large master bedroom on the high setting (we like the sound and the breeze).  Others mentioned that it's not all that powerful. but we find it plenty strong for indoor/casual use.  It's not an industrial shop fan by any means. but it's great for cooling a large room. painted walls. even outside on a deck.  It's very light for it's size and the tilting feature is nice."
2,"I don't often rave about a product. but this one deserves it.  This is what I so love about it: 1. Works like a dream. No rattles. shakes. quivers. Just a steady strong stream of wonderful air.  2.Well built.  It arrived in the military pouch system with the box a bit smashed. but not a single dent on the item.  3. It's light.  I can cart it room to room very easily.  Even though it's so light. it sits on the floor very stably.  4. The only sound it makes is the sound of air moving. no whine. no rattles. no vibrations.  5. No assembly required. None! 6. The design is compact. extreme care given to maximizing output for the footprint.  I'm impressed."
2,"This fan really moves the air. To give you an idea how good this fan works. do you know those 20' box fans they sell for 15 or 20 bucks. well this Lasko 3300 fan on low blows as hard as the 20' box fan on high. No kidding. I think this is by far the best fan I've ever owned.Will post a couple pictures for you to get a better look at it. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan. Don't hesitate. buy it."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
2,"This fan will blow you down. Works just as good as the heavy duty silver fans. I sit my fan on top of my radiator or a stand right by the window at night and my room goes from hot to cold in a split second. It brings all that cool night air right into my house. All fans don't do this. Burrrrr I'm getting goose bumps now because I'm freezing. Let me get up and turn it to low now since its extremely cool in here. I have 2 of these. I used to have 3 but the third one disappeared. Maybe someone stole it.  Oh Well . anyway fan is definitely worth the price."
2,"Even on the lowest setting. this thing is definitely a wind machine. While my apartment is central air conditioned. I like to keep the thermostat on 78 to save energy. Having this fan definitely helps things feel cooler and results in less trips to the thermostat to turn down the temperature.When you crank this thing up to high. it's really a force to be reckoned with. My cat is slightly scared of it on higher settings as it does get a little loud and moves quite a bit of air.Added benefit is that if you use this in a bedroom at night. it serves as a pretty decent white noise source as well.Great fan all around. especially for those hot summer days."
2,"I received this cooker for Christmas 2008 ( a Wal Mart purchase).It was my first pressure cooker. and it cooked wonderfully (though it was a bit tight for two chickens); until it failed.After about 6 uses. it would no longer establish pressure.  The red pop up on the handle (indication that pressure was up and handle locked) started popping up to about twice the height it normally emerged from the handle (when the cooker worked) and steam vented from all around the handle junction with the lid.I tried everything the book said to do.  The handle was tight.  I inspected. streched and oiled the gasket. No luck.  I called Mirro (Wearever) and they told me to boil the gasket for 15 min. and then oil it.  I did all these things. to no avail.So I returned it.  Now I'm going to try Presto."
2,"Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run.  A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it.  Never thought I'd own one (grew up with one -- home cooking). so thought I'd try it myself.So you know. bought one at Walmart (has the Wearever brand)-- $40.00. and it comes with a real return policy vs. Amazon's 30 day return policy (make sure you read that before buying anything here...surprising how inflexible they are if you miss it by only a few days. even for long standing customers who have never asked for any special preferences.)"
2,"I bought this only to make apple sauce. Growing up. my mother had one (for 25+ years) that all of us kids would use and this is nothing like the one we used to use. I have used it 6-8 times and have found the following:- I can only fit a very small bowl underneath it.- The legs slide all over the place easily. I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine. but the craftsmanship is very low. VERY thin metal. and I don't expect this to last more than 2 seasons of making apple sauce. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this item."
2,"My 'ricer' - collander - food press arrived just an hour ago. I have fond memories of this 'ricer'. a favorite kitchen implement of my Dad's. I still have an old pestle from the old days.  The design is a little different from the ones of my childhood. but I think this design appeals to me more.  I love 'riced' potatoes and anticipate using this 'food press' to make tomato purees and finish other fruit. I'm just excited to have it."
2,"Back in the day. moms all had pressure cookers and made beef stews and pot roasts in them. These cookers are being rediscovered and are making a big comeback as they're not just for stew any more. Hundreds of new recipes are appearing and Amazon has some really good pressure cooker cookbooks available. We recently bought this Presto 4 qt. size (just for 2 of us) but larger sizes are available. Mom was right. they are FAST. make delicious food and will impress guests. They're not expensive - give this a try. you won't be disappointed."
2,"Other reviewers see the same problem as mine.The lower handle has little to hold it on. The single bolt that came with the pot is too small and won't hold on. We were forced into using a 32 thread 1/4' hex bolt. It held for a year. Now the handle has fallen off. again. Is the bolt the problem? No. it's the threaded receptacle! MAYBE. if I drill out the receiving threaded shank and try to force a 32 thread #10 bolt in.If This doesn't work. I'm avoiding buying another Presto from China.When the pot worked. it did well. A little hard to get the aluminium grooves to hit the slots without a fight.Nope. this cooker is useless. Presto you stink."
2,"There is little good about this Presto 4qt Aluminum pressure cooker.  It...Cannot keep the handle tight. I have to tighten it down about every other use.Cannot form a steam tight seal. steam leaks out around the handles. making them hot to touch. and through the pressure stem indicator that is supposed to seal off...it doesn't.Cannot keep the broth (fluid) inside from spewing out the weighted rocker pressure regulator even though the fluid level is well below the 4 guart level.Has no opposing handle; so picking it up while hot and full is problematic when trying to move the cooker to a faucet to cool it down.In a word. we got what we paid for...the cheapest and worst made pressure cooker on the market."
2,"Our 20+ year old 4 quart Presto pressure cooker has had at least half a dozen gasket replacements. We're pretty old. so I thought it was time to get my 79 year old cook. and lovely wife of 55 years a bright new pot instead of just another gasket.The old one worked well for all these years. and the new one already has a dozen or more cooking cycles on it - and appears to do as well as the one it replaced.BTW: we replaced a 6 quart Presto at the same time and the comment is the same on it."
2,"I was finally convinced that I need a pressure cooker for meat due to my work hours. I looked everywhere for the smallest size. they were either unavailable or too expensive. Reviews here showed great product so I bought it. I used it the very first day and I couldn't be more satisfied. Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes. I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that doesn't affect the cooking. It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook."
2,"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker. purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap. it not only does not do the job. the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker. that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk."
2,"I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault. I didn't realize that this model did not have a quick release. I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault. I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves. I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it. That is why I stuck with the same brand. I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also didn't like how I had to screw the handles into place. I want something that has permanently attached handles. I'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto. I can't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option. If anyone does. please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me."
2,"I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker. hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use. just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean. as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!"
2,"I live at 9500 ft altitude where it can take many hours to tenderize anything. I cook stew meat in 25 to 30 mins. pot roast in 50 mins. veggies in 5 mins after it gets up to temp. Trick is to have only the small recommended amount of water.I've had the 6 qt stainless for 18 years and need to replace the rubber seal and plug every 7 years or so. I use mine a lot. 3 times a week ($7 for both at AMZ) which is why I am here commenting. Don't get the aluminum ones. not good for you.Very safe and fool proof. You can't open it until it stops steaming.Tales about dangerous come from Grandmas who were cooking in the 1930's. 40 and early 50's before safety features.Buy into their recipes not their tales."
2,"This is my second presto pressure cooker in a year. I loved my first one and used it several times a week. but I didn't add enough water once. scorched the heck out of it. and it was never the same. I tried all the thrifty tricks to get out scorched ick but it didn't work. However. I liked and used this one so much I bought another one exactly like my first.I have a Russel Hobbes electric pressure cooker that is larger and really nice for food that cooks longer because I can set it and walk away. However. it's big and bulky. My Presto is my go too pressure cooker for potatoes. makes great cheesecake. I love pressure cooking squash. carrots etc. The construction is heavy and seems well made."
2,"Just received this unit. and I'm very happy with it so far. It is easy to assemble. sturdy. and most importantly has a very simple design which I anticipate will be durable into the future. My previous pressure cooker was a complex affair with springs and components tucked away in plastic housing so that they could not be accessed. This design. on the other hand. is much more simplistic. which is a very good thing. It cost about 1/4 the price of the cheapest PC that I could get in local stores (including postage). and is a preferable design."
2,"Strong words for a pressure cooker. I know. but this thing has been such a disappointment.  I bought it to replace my old 6-Quart Presto pressure cooker that worked well and faithfully for many years.  I'm not sure if they have started making these things in China after I purchased my last pressure cooker or what.  This new one is much lighter weight and the metal feels thin and cheap.  The handle screw continually comes loose which makes the handle itself loose and wobbly.  The pressure hole doesn't seem to line up properly so that I have to use a knife to wiggle the pressure button free to pop up so it can start to cook after the pressure builds.  If you are looking for a solid. reliable pressure cooker - - keep looking!  This is not the one!"
2,"I had never used a pressure cooker before but have been planning to buy one for a while. and decided to buy this one because it looks well made and has good reviews.I tried cooking several vegetables and some Sirloin tips (separately) and found the Sirloin surprisingly tender. the vegetables retained a lot more flavor.I did carefully read the instructions and after one or two uses found it easy to use. I bought a timer to use with it because cooking times seem to be important as does making sure it does not boil dry.This is a great time and energy saver. resulting in great tasting food!"
2,"I have been using Presto Pressure Cookers for the past 35+ years. they are simply the best on the market. and I have had other brands. those other brands ended up at my yard sale. the Presto Pressure Cooker is the best! always reliable. and I have never had to replace the gasket. that is saying something to the quality of the product. which by the was has been on the market for longer than I have been alive. and thats a long long time. so why bother with the rest when you can have the best. and at a great price. give it a try. you will be delighted with all you can make and the time saved cooking this way. especially cheaper cuts of meat.I can't say enough good things about this pressure cooker!"
2,"I had one of these great cookers long ago.  My old one was very heavy.  This one is made of stainless steel and seems to be lighter.  I had to attach the handles. so some assembly on this one is required.  My first recipe was. 'Ham Hocks & Navy Beans'. and I cooked the pre-soaked beans and ham hocks in about 25 or 30 minutes.  They turned out great. but had to guess at the cooking time. as the recipe was not in the enclosed instruction/recipe booklet. but in my head!  Since then. I have purchased two great pressure cooker cookbooks.  I plan to cook many more dishes in this quick-cooking appliance.  Be sure to read THOROUGHLY. the instruction booklet. to safely use this(& all) pressure cookers."
2,"I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130."
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
2,"I have an electric pressure cooker that has a hard anodized interior that is sometimes impossible to clean.  This stainless steel pressure cooker is a breeze to clean.  As soon as it arrived I went to my local hardware store and replaced all of the screws with stainless steel because that seem to be a problem with other users.  I soaked some black beans and after only 4 minutes cooking under pressure. I had a pot of beans.  The 6 quart size is perfect for me since you can't fill it too much.  I just love my new pressure cooker.  Looking forward to many great meals."
2,"We have had a pressure cook for many years.  It was great for camping. for we could make New England Boil Dinner.  My wife has our old one at the shore. and we use it a lot.  However. many of the family are not there but in our villa 100 miles away. and we like many meals that we us the Presto pressure cooker.  Now. I can make the dinners here. and we thing they are the best pressure cookers around.  It is great time saver."
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
2,"This is a really excellent item....but the little rubber safety button (to release pressure if something gets clogged) isn't as good as it could be.  Every now and then. it releases the steam so no pressure can build up.  If I jiggle it. to get it to set. it generally falls down into the kettle.  At that point. I have to remove the lid. and fish the button out of whatever is in there -- easy if it's broccoli. but more of a problem if it's bean soup.  I realize that this is my fault for not checking it each time. but with my old one (not nearly as good. overall) I never had to think about it.  Remember. this is a GREAT pressure cooker -- I'm just kvetching."
2,"I always avoided pressure cookers until a little over a year ago. I purchased the Presto 6-quart electric version. I love it. but it is annoying to have to drag it out when I wanted to use it. I saw this smaller size stove-top variety and hoped it would be as good as the electric. It's better!  I never put it away because it has become my go-to pan whether or not I'm using the pressure cooking feature. It's a good weight. great heat distribution. NOT aluminium. and sturdy. As a pressure cooker. I find that I can turn the heat on my stove to between 2 and 3 and it works beautifully. From using the other pressure cooker once or twice a month. I find I use this one three-four times a week. Minor issue - yes - the screws do rust. One of these days. I'll take one to Home Depot so I can get a non-rusting version."
2,"my mother used her pressure cooker to feed 5 kids on a regular basis. and the stories of her mother's old ring-style pressure cooker. well... just hilarious.  I have no such entertaining stories. just dozens of great meals cooked quickly and well in a cooker that goes directly into the dishwasher. no fuss. no muss.  Learn how to use one and you will never live without one.  This one is quite good because if the cooker isn't stainless steel. putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white.  And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood."
2,"I've used a Premium grade. Innova 8 Qt. for years. It is way too big for every day. single person use. The Presto works decently. but not well built. The handles are fastened by only one screw. The lid closing stop. catches past the point it should be. The lid pressure open-lock safety takes effort to seat when heating up.The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in. Dia. Without the lid. the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in. height. the 6 Qt is only 2 in. taller making it the better option. A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.Induction compatible??? A magnet sticks to the bottom and top. but not the sides."
2,"I replaced my old Aluminium Pressure cooker (4 Litre) from India with this wonderful stainless steel pressure cooker. The quality is great and the price is fantastic. The pressure cooker from India blew a whistle by itself to let out the pressure and 4-5 whistles were enough to cook lentils. rice. potatoes etc.. This cooker does not blow the whistle by itself (starts rocking) but instead I manually let out the steam 4-5 times. Saves a lot of energy and cooks quickly. I have 2 dabbas ( containers ) from the previous cooker that fit inside this cooker. That way I can cook Dal and rice at once. Definitely recommend this cooker. I ordered an extra gasket just in case :) Always better to keep extra gaskets"
2,"My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.  Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.  What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating. & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.  I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.  This one is so much quieter. too.  Tonight. I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.  You can't beat that.  The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.  I should have bought this years ago."
2,"Been using pressure cookers for years - grew up on a farm - pressure cookers abundant.Needed to replace the 30+ year old Mirro aluminum one.Still have my aluminum 2 1/2 qt Mirro but wanted a bigger one.So I bought this one to try. Cookers are all basically the same.HOWEVER -----I wish SOMEone would have posted SOMEwhere that this product is- wait for it - - -MADE IN CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA!Oh I get it - if we are told it is not USA made. we will look elsewhere.What a rip! I am so very disappointed that we cannot purchase something made in the USA anymore.Thanks to all our government officials by helping every one on this planet but our own people.We cannot even buy a cooking pot for cripes sake!Let's see if in another 30 years I still have this CHINESE pot.For cryin' out loud.......................  :o("
2,"I prefer meat browned. and veggies either raw. stirfried. fermented or roasted. so I got this primarily for making bone broths. cooking legumes and cooking whole grains.I got the 4-quart as it's just me and hubby here. but I did not realize you can't fill this more than 2/3rd full.  Now I wish I'd have ordered the 6-quart.Even though it's stainless. it's very lightweight.  This is handy as I have permanent chest pain after surgery. so lifting can be difficult.It works fine.  It makes very concentrated fast broths in the summer when I don't want things simmering on the stove for hours.  Similarly. I can cook big batches of legumes and freeze in meal-sized portions fast.  I haven't tried grains yet as I was on a risotto kick when this arrived. and then went on a temporary grain-free diet.I am quite satisfied. except I wish I'd gotten the larger one."
2,"Amazing quality ... made a whole chicken in less than 30min... juicy and perfect.. moist... cleans up beautifully... Very pleased with this product!...Just wanted to add a note.. I never run water over the pan to cool it down...as it is still cooking.. I know how long meat and veggies take when cooking traditionally. so I time it based on experience. When you let it cool on it's own. that is part of the actual cooking time with the pressurization. Follow the instructions and you can't go wrong.  I just shut the fire down about 10min less to incorporate cool down... Any longer would be overdone..."
2,"I've used pressure cookers for many years including some of those very expensive models.  This is one of the best cookers I've ever owed.  This cooker is constructed of high quality stainless steel and is very easy to use.  Pressure cookers are very safe. If you follow a few simple rules. you'll never have a problem.  I use my cooker weekly for everything from cream of potato soup to braised lamb shanks with wine sauce.  Additionally. it is amazingly cheap to own. My only con: wish it was made in the USA. otherwise. highly recommend."
2,"They are so quick and efficient.  When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep. that's how much I love them.  My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.  However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.  So he bought me this smaller version.  Obviously it weighs less. takes up less room in my cupboard. and comes to heat much quicker.  What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!"
2,"If the handles fit tighter without wobbling I'd love it but you cant complain too much for the $25 or so I paid. Good things are its not too big. the lid goes on real smooth. the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go. when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move. lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of."
2,"I've looked and checked out many other pressure cookers before buying this one. From the costly ones in department stores to others online. Department stores prices were to high and I couldn't get any product information from the sales people I would talk with. After reading the reviews here I decided to purchase the Presto. Best choice I've made. The arrival was within a few days. The Cooker is great looking after using it for four different meals. We have enjoyed a delicious pot roast. chicken with veggies. and a hard to cook oxtail stew. There was no problem with reading the directions on how to use. I did it without my husband my assistance. (he's better with gagets). I am planning on using it at least once a week for hardy winter meals."
2,"This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.  I am happy about 'stainless steel' because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made. top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that. I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."
2,"It's been several months since I've purchased the Presto 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker. and I have to admit that this cooker packs some seriously power!  Having a pressure cooker speeds up cooking so much - I've been able to make a lot of Chinese Soups in a fraction of the time it takes to make normally!  This pot is especially good when cooking soups with proteins. particularly beans and meat.  Because it cooks so quickly. we're not only enjoying dinner faster. but saving a lot of energy to boot!  Highly recommended!"
2,"As a child I was scared to death of my mom's pressure cooker and swore I'd never have one.  But this one is very  nice.  There are two ways to cook with it after the little toggle starts rocking you are instructed to (1) put the pot under water and it cools down all at once. or (2) let it cool down on its own.  If you are instructed to let it cool down on its own. it can take up to 30 minutes to cool down. I thought cooking with this would be a lot quicker; but that aside. it is a great way to have something that really does cook in a fraction of the time it normally takes to cook something; but it is not a &#34;microwave&#34; quick type of instrument."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
2,"My mom brought a pressure cooker from Brasil 15 years ago. and on our last trip she was not able to find replacement rubber gaskets for it. I talked her into replacing it for something new. shiny and fancy. The quality is there. and the locking mechanism is STRONG. It's not a latch on the handle like a traditional pressure cooker. This unit has slots all around the pan that link up to the lid. and you rotate the lid to seal the unit. That means there's more than 8 latches on the pan. Those beans aren't getting out any time soon."
2,"I had this in my wishlist & received it for Christmas.  I've used it several times & I love it.  Its smaller than the one I had previously but that is perfect for us.  Only 3 at home anymore.I love that this is made of stainless steel.  The insert is still made of aluminum which Im not thrilled about but I dont have to use it if I dont want to.This pressure cooker is also a lot quieter than my old one is.  I appreciate that a LOT!Its a great product and Im so happy to have it."
2,"The handle for the pot is secured with only one screw. The handle itself is curved to fit against the pot. but the directions emphasize multiple times that you shouldn't overtighten to avoid cracking the plastic.  I tightened it reasonably and when the pot is full and it's tilted to pour out the contents (boiling water for example). the handle wobbles/turns slightly.  I can easily see this becoming a hazard with continued use/failure to retighten regularly.  Fortunately. Amazon was willing to accept the return.  The company could resolve this problem by using metal on the edge of the handle piece. selling their pots pre-assembled in a more sturdy manner. or hey- bright idea- USING TWO FASTENERS LIKE EVERY OTHER POT MANUFACTURER.  Hmm."
2,"Before purchasing this pressure cooker. I went to Macy's and bought an aluminum pressure cooker because it was on sale.  Got it home and tried it out.  After cooking my meal. I noticed the inside of the pressure cooker had become terribly discolored. I did not want my family eating out of that pressure cooker.  So I immediately took it back.  I purchased the Presto 6-qt. pressure cooker and I do love it.  It is stainless steel. easy clean-up and no discoloration.  I should have known better because I had a Presto for over 25 years.  The rocker on my old one wore out and I knew it was time to get another.  If you're looking to replace an older model or just plain looking for a new pressure cooker. you won't be disappointed with this one."
2,"This purchase was one of the first times that Amazon reviews let me down. As others have recently stated. it seems Presto has changed manufacturing of the screws. making the handles of this pressure cooker unsteady...no matter how many times I tighten the screws. and how tight I. or my husband. try to get them. they loosen and the handles become very wobbly. This is not just a problem with one handle. but both handles! I tried this item for a week. which required retightening the handles about a dozen times. and I have given up.Additionally. after only two washes. the screws are already starting to rust! I didn't wash it in the dishwasher. it was by hand.I can understand why this is an inexpensive product...it is cheaply made! However. I am baffled at why it gets such good reviews."
2,"One upon a time. many years ago.. I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well. time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work. I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home. I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!"
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
2,"I've owned several pressure cookers over the years.  This one is my current favorite for several reasons.  First. I like the 4-qt. size.  It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.  Next. I'm happy with the  quality of the product.  It's hefty enough to feel substantial. yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.  The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.  Last. this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt. model.  I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one. but I like the speed.  I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.  I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again."
2,"This seems to be a high quality product at a very reasonable price.  It cooks less expensive cuts of beef (stew meat. chuck roast. corned beef) to mouth watering tenderness in a fraction of the time required in either an oven or slow cooker.  It quickly cooks two or three pounds of chicken for salads. sandwiches. or freezing.  Cook a pork roast with your favorite barbeque sauce in 30-45 minutes and enjoy pulled pork sandwiches infused with the flavor of the sauce.  This would be a great tool for the cook who likes make- ahead meals and stocking the freezer for quick-reheating weekday dinners.  Get the stainless steel model to avoid the reaction of aluminum to acidic foods.  Eventually you will be glad you did.The clad base is very heavy so I wouldn't recommend using the pan for pasta or vegetables but if you have strong wrists and arms you could do this.  Other lids are available from Presto."
2,"My wife is from Brazil. so she is a foremost authority on pressure cookers as they use them there for almost every meal daily.Originally I tried the very cheap aluminum alternative for $15 on sale at Sears. and it failed after one use.This is better than the ones that last 20 years in Brazil. It's efficient. it's durable. it's just plain a good product. and you really shouldn't pay more for a pressure cooker than $40-$50 as it's a very simple item."
2,"I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.  I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto. missed it and decided to get another one.  The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.  This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.  The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.  It seems to be pretty stout overall.  I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks."
2,"This is an investment every house cook should make. The meats come out super duper tender and it takes no time at all. 10 min and your chicken for soup or any dish is ready! The top is very very sturdy so do not worry about it coming off or exploding while under pressure. I love my pressure cooker and this smaller size is perfect for my husband and I since it's just the two of us. And remember to always get STAINLESS STEEL. Aluminium eventually peels off and isn't as durable. plus it's toxic for you. Oh. and cleaning is a snap!!! Dishwasher safe and even is  you do it by hand. nothing sticks :) good purchase"
2,"Gas and electricity has gone up so much lately. Pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster.  It comes with a compact user guide and a small cookbook.Pressure cookers can be dangerous. so make sure to read the safety precautions. Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity. You cannot open the lid while it is still pressurized with the built-in precautionary lock. but the rocker valve can easily get toppled and extremely hot steam can escape through it.Pros:- Stainless steel. You do not want aluminum for health reasons.- We have been using this for more than 5 years.  We just have to replace the rubber gasket around the lid.- Although not as cheap as we like it to be. if you compare it to other manufacturers. you still save some money.Cons:- The pressure valve rocker. Other pressure cookers (but more expensive) has a  non-removable pressure valve.  It is often get misplaced.- The rocker makes quite a bit noise."
2,"Get the Presto. They're all the same. It's a simple design. a pot and lid. I've been using them for 20 years and the expensive ones are no better than the Presto- Only an amateur cook would believe different. The Prestos cook just as good and just as fast as the Rikons. My kitchen is filled with the best and most expensive equipment money can buy. but when it comes to pressure cookers. it's not like other cookware where you 'get what you pay for.'  They're all the same (although I don't recommend the electric ones as they have a tendency to break down). Save your money for the good espresso maker... don't waste it on expensive pressure cookers. Get the Presto."
2,"As many folks out there. including Anthony Bourdain I too was scared of pressure cookers. After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual. as if for a school test. The rocker type is really totally harmless! Cooking times are slashed by at least two thirds. less gas and therefor less escaped heat and better inefficiency make this cooking method a winner. Cleanup is also very quick. The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat. which is essential for good flavor. Anne Burrell always says:&#34;Brown Food tastes Good&#34;."
2,"I have always been afraid of pressure cookers because as a child my mother always banned me from the kitchen when she was using one. Well. twenty some odd years later I finally purchased this one.  I read the instruction booklet and the first night made mashed potatoes and a pot roast.  Wow!  My 12 year old son loved the meal and said these mashed potatoes were the best he ever ate and the meat was so tender.  It was so easy to use and easy to clean.  I am already planning on making BBQ pork ribs next!  Whoo-Hoo! Buy it! Use it!....but read the instructions first! Enjoy:-)"
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
2,"I bought this pressure cooker to make chili. I've never owned or used a pressure cooker and was a bit nervous when I fired it up for the 1st time. It heat up real quick using a ceramic glass cook top. and I was to able to brown the meat realitively quick. The contruction of this pressure cooker looks very high quality and well made. The only thing I wanna add is be very careful with when to lower the heat and when to move the steam controlling top on the top. You can lower the heat as soon as you see steam coming out of the bottom of steam controlling top. and be very careful not to touch the top until the nipple on the handle drops down. indicating that there's no pressure in the cooker. Good investment!"
2,"Sadly returning this.  The handles won't stay tight and the screws that hold them are already rusting. Plus hard to get it up to pressure - too much sputtering around the handle for a long time!  I remember my Mother cooking delicious tender meats in her pressure cooker years ago.  But I did not have good results with this one. Followed directions and chicken came out tough.  And - a magnet won't stick to the interior (only the exterior)...so maybe the interior is not stainless steel. but aluminum..which is not what I want to cook my food in. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy."
2,"My Mom always told me horror stories about pressure cooker. but I really wanted one after listening to my friend's successful experience with it. I got this 4-quart one several weeks ago. and I am super happy with it!!  I have been pulling an entire beef top round and pork shoulder straight out of FREEZER to cook in pressure cooker. and I was able to serve dinner in an hour.  It's perfect for a poor planner like me.I did read the manual over and over to make sure it is safe. and yes. it is safe!"
2,"I have had the 4 quart pressure cooker for quite some time.  and based on its performance.  I purchased the 6 quart for myself and one for my daughter as well.  We are very pleased.  This is a good product.  but it is important to read and follow the instructions for use and care in order to get the most satisfactory results. I was raised with Presto pressure cookers. and have used others.  None have performed better. in my opinion.  The reasonable price is an added bonus.5/10/08: Presto offers a stainless steel steamer basket and a glass lid as optional accessories that fit both their 4 qt. and 6 qt. pressure cookers.  I purchased the steamer for my daughter and myself.  and the lid for myself.  These products have been welcome additions to our cooking tools.  Do not be afraid to spend the extra money for them...they are well worth it!"
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
2,"I've used a 6-qt. aluminum pressure cooker for years.  It finally bit the dust so I decided to try a stainless steel cooker.  This one is taller. but not as wide. as my previous cooker.  However. it is plenty big to hold a 3-4 pound chicken or roast. which is what I usually cook in it.  So far I really like it - and no problems yet with hardware rusting like I've read in a few reviews.  I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a not-too-big pressure cooker!"
2,"This is my first pressure cooker and I really like it.  For this price. it is a good choice for those who aren't sure if they will use it much.  It is especially useful for vegetarians.  Beans that normally take 2 hours to simmer in a sauce pan are done in 20 minutes in the pressure cooker.  I was afraid to use it at first but there are safety features which should make you comfortable using it.  As long as it is under pressure. you cannot open the top.Although I do like this product. it is overly large for my needs.  If you just plan on cooking a cup or two of beans at a time. I would recommend getting the 4 qt version of this product.  Because the pressure cooker is so fast. there's really no need to make large batches of things."
2,"I love my pressure cooker. Super reliable and if you follow the directions. it always cooks perfectlly Brown rice is cooked in 12 minutes! My first lesson was to factor in the amount of time it takes for the pressure cooker to cool down enough to open the lid. That usually takes another 10 minutes - if you are trying to orchestrate all your food being ready at the same time for a hot meal. I am guessing the cool down time is also part of the cooking process. The instruction/cook book that comes with it is very right on and helpful. Very east to clean. make sure you take out the rubber gasket from the lid and clean it well after each use. I have read that pressure cooking retains more nutrients in the food than any other type of cooking. Makes sense because so little steam or anything escapes."
2,"So we've had this vacuum cleaner for a bit over a  year now. It was purchased September 8. 2009.Currently. my wife is complaining that the vacuum is not providing enough suction to pick up the dirt. The bag in the back was emptied so we know that's not the problem. Time is going to be spent trying to figure out what's wrong with it. and it may be finished das far as I know.My impression of the vacuum over time hasn't been that great. It performed rather poorly on hardwood flooring from the start. and I can't say I was overly impressed on carpet. It's clunky to move around. and when the bag approaches full it tends to tip over."
2,"I've been vacuuming for over 40 years and I enjoy trying new products.I have a myriad of machines. from $100.00 to $1400.00.  No matter what I try. Eureka makes the best vacuuming products and this particular model is best for carpets.  The ergonomics are perfect. but the singularly winning aspect of this machine is it's strong suction and firm grabbing power as you pull it back toward yourself. It's easy use is a huge plus for me - no need to disassemble. re-arrange. clean or empty trays. reassemble. etc.  I just tap the 'On' button. release the handle and go.  I'll buy one of these for every floor in the house and keep each plugged in and ready to go."
2,"I've only had this vacuum for 2 months but it's everything the other reviews said it was.  It's light and easy to maneuver.  I have two long hair cats and it has no problem with all of the shedding.  I like the carpet level adjustment so I can do the bare floor as well as the carpet (for thorough cleaning I use a small wand vacuum for the bare floors).  Assembly is a cinch. took me under 1/2 hour.  Returned my Oreck in favor of this one."
2,"My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them.  I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag.  I am very pleased with it.  It is fairly quiet for a vacuum cleaner. my old model used to scream like a banshee.  and it doesn't have a bunch of hoses wrapped around it constantly coming loose like my old model.  It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model.If you just need to vacuum the floor. this model is great."
2,"We purchased this unit originally for our own use. because our relatives had one of these always available happily for decades. but later. we shared this unit with a close family who needed it to help them with maintenance of newly refurbished wood flooring. and now that WE are writing this review. WE are reminded that WE really need to purchase another of these units in the not too distant future. hopefully still available from Amazon. when it comes time for us to make another purchase of it. because WE feel after years of family use. that this type of unit really is the BEST to use to clean and polish floors and make the job at hand the easiest possible. and the family we shared our other unit with. also voiced this same response to us as well. Blessings to you in all your floor maintenance adventures."
2,"My Mom bought me one of these from Walmart when I was in middleschool. Ive kept it ever since... Its lasted through highschool. going to summer camp. it went to college with me (I used it as extra seating and as a bed a couple of times). It made it through moving 3 times after college and the only reason it didnt deploy with me (much better than Army Toughboxes) is that it didnt have wheels. its lasted half a lifetime and still doesnt even have a strach on it. I love this thing!"
2,"I got the 35-gallon size to store some items in the basement that I wanted to be able to get to conveniently but also be able to lock up and keep out of the kids' hands. This box is absolutely perfect for what I intended. Maybe even a bit of overkill on my part (this thing is super solid) but better safe than sorry. It is very well made. Of course. I'm not truly putting it through its paces by using it in a truck bed or travelling through air ports with it or anything like that. but after receiving it and having a chance to see how well made it is. I have little doubt it would excel for those uses as well.Note: If you are looking on putting a lock on it. I recommend you get the 'cable' style of Master combo lock that Amazon suggests. The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock. Not impossible. but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable."
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
2,"Excellent durability.  Good space inside and latches closed.  Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.  As built now. you will need two people to handle this huge bin.  Would also help if the handholds were deeper.  Overall. very good.Update 11/22/11:  Not as durable as I had originally thought.  Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split. so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid.  And yes. the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.  Still. it's a decent box that continues to function okay."
2,"I purchased 2 of the 24 Gallon size. one to use as an emergency medical supply container and one to utilize as a portable survival (bug out) box. I found that the 24 gallon size is plenty large enough for each of my intended uses. I kept my items limited to what was most basic and necessary and I still have room for some additional items.I am pleased that I got the 24 gallon size for my purposes because even when they are packed I can still lift them and they are easily transportable. I would think a larger size container that was packed may be too heavy to handle without help.I have posted some pictures. they have hard plastic handles that snap into position and they have a place for you to lock then. Sturdy enough construction and appear to be rugged and durable."
2,"I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many. many (20?) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps. It has sat out in broiling sun. freezing winter. pouring rain. and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy. I was delighted to see that these were still available. and the new one looks just like the old one. but with brighter colors (and less dirt!) It should be good for another 20 years!"
2,"Here's the question: does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry?  Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo?  If so. then this isn't for you if it's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier.  OTOH. if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate. then it'll do that OK.  I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.  It's *pretty* tight... but not totally so.  It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm."
2,"I installed two Lasko 3012 fans in my fitness room after some modifications to enable them to mount them directly over the power receptacles which are at 72 inches above the floor.I replaced the existing room duplex wall receptacles with the Leviton 688 recessed receptacle and modified the fan by removing all but about 20 inches of power cord and drilling a 1.75 inch hole in the back of the fan allowing the remainder of the cord and the rear of the plug to recess into the fan. The end result is that there is no power cord showing (just like in the picture (where the power cord must have been removed)). The Leviton 688 and fan mounting plate also had to be modified just slighting in order to accommodate each other. Naturally. I tested the fans before making the modifications which were not difficult at all.The fans aren't noisy and they move plenty of air on low speed."
2,"Fed-Ex just dropped it at my door a matter of minutes ago.  Thought I would give it quick test on the kitchen floor.  WOW!  Floor clean in seconds.  Before I realized it. the entire 2 bedroom apartment was clean in a couple of minutes.  It whizzed across the ceramic tile floors and short nap throw rugs.  Who knew this kind of power could be had for 65 dollars?  Excellent value.  How can such a light weight vacuum have so much power?  It took me longer to write this review then vacuum the entire apartment.  I love it."
2,"I used to own a Mighty Light. which is a very similar vacuum from Eureka.Used that one for about 5-6 years until it finally broke.This thing is slightly stronger and a little louder.This vacuum does a great job getting dust and Cat hair from just about anything(carpet. velvet drapes). Best part is you do not have to run the thing over every inch of the surface (unlike other small canisters). it's powerful enough to suck dust in even when it's in the close proximity."
2,"I like this vacuum and am glad I purchased it.  The price was good and for hard floors it it easy to use and is quite powerful.  One complaint that I do have is that because of the bend in the hose handle sometimes clogs occur if you accidentally vacuum up something like paper or large pieces of something.  It is hard to clear it but the suction hole in the handle helps enable you to 'fish out' whatever is in there.  I wish that the handle was not bent.  It may make it easy to hold but the tendency for clogging is greatly increased.  Other than that I have no complaints.  You cannot beat the price and for hard surfaces it works better than any upright I have owned.  For the carpet in my bedrooms I do use an upright for so I would not suggest using this for plush carpet. However it does work well on area rugs and low pile carpets."
2,"Let's be honest: this is an inexpensive vacuum and yet. it lives up to everything the manufacturer says it does.  I have a Dyson that is amazing on carpet -  but I recently moved to a condo that has all hardwood floors and it just wasn't doing the job. With the recent move. I didn't want to spend more than a $100 dollars but also didn't want to regret my purchase.  After carefully reading the reviews here - I decided on the Eureka.Here are some pros:1. Amazing suction power2. Super lightweight3. Very long extension - can reach high places easily4. The hose where it connects to the vacuum rotates. creating smooth movement5. Nice long cordHere are the cons:1. The extension tubes sometimes don't stay attached while vacuuming (can be annoying)2. The opening under the floor tool does not extend the width to the edges (but the suction power makes up for it)I hope this was helpful!"
2,"After our quite old Eureka canister vacuum had finally gone belly up. we were looking for an appropriate replacement.  Because this was needed primarily for cleaning hardwood floors. there were a few critical criteria.  It had to be strong. yet compact in size.  It should not be too loud. and the tool assortment should be appropriate for floors and vacuuming cat hair of various furniture items.  Finally. we did not want to have to mess around with cleaning out bagless vacuum containers.  The Eureka Mighty Mite 3670 came through with flying colors on all fronts.  It produces a powerful vacuum. easily maneuverable. convenient for storing. the noise is not too bad. and a good price.  This vacuum cleaner gives an excellent value. and. certainly. gets the job done that we bought it for."
2,"I can only give this a 3. Tools are to small-the motor has a w h i n e to it that drives me nuts! The motor also seems to get very hot--maybe I got a dud and just don't know it. The hoses are stiff-no flexibility at all. I do like a canister vacuum though as opposed to an upright-at least this one follows me around and doesn't knock me out when I pull it along. All in all it is an OK product but they could have done a much better job with the design--you must wrap the cord on the bottom for storage-not a useful feature at all--does it work ok? Sure it does. Should you buy it? Only if you don't mind all the above draw backs."
2,"I didn't expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum.  I was purchasing to vacuum cat and dog hair on my carpeted stairs and to vacuum my car.  This little 'mighty mite' packs a big punch.  Superb suction. compact and light weight. but does not feel flimsy.  When researching this purchase I found the other customer reviews helpful. and I also found other references to this model as being one of the better canister compacts.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum."
2,"I've had one of these for a couple of months and so far. so good.  It is loud but tolerable.  I think the bags are easy to change -- as with most vacuums. I recommend not waiting until a bag is overfull or things get messy. The long hose is good for reaching under things but makes it a bit of a pain to store.  I think the plastic it is made of is a bit cheap and I wonder if it will hold up over time.  I didn't want to spend a lot though and think it's a good product for the price."
2,"Probably best vaccuum I have ever owned. I only ever buy stand up vacuums but this one had great reviews and I thought. what the heck. It is really light. I hardly ever notice it trailing along behind me. and it has a really good suction! I love the long hose and different attachments. Whereas I used to just vacuum my rugs. now my cleaning routine consists of me vacuuming everything in my house. I mean everything. Lol. It goes from hardwood to carpet easily. the bags last a long time. There are 2 cons on this product in my opinion. 1) the cord does not retract. and 2) the hose is somewhat thin and occasionally kinks. It does seem the hose won't last long but I can't imagine it is much to replace."
2,"My law office is 2.000 square feet of carpeted and tiled floors. We have an upright and a steam vac for the carpets and they do fine. I bought this 3670G 12 amp Eureka mainly for the tiled floors. cleaning the drapes and (because of its long wands) hard to reach places behind desks and work tables. I am very pleased with it. It uses bags. but that is a good feature for us as we like bags when pulling up dust and dust mites (the bags are cheap as I just bought 24 for $12). I do not recommend this vacuum for carpets in general because the large attachment you see in the photo is not a brush attachment (it does come with a smaller brush attachment for drapes and hard to reach spots). But for sucking up loose junk on tile and in between tiles it is great. It is also great for cleaning drapes (floor to ceiling) and hard to reach spots because of the long wand extensions.  Would buy again if needed. 4 stars"
2,"This powerful little light-weight machine cleans my house in no time. When the bag gets full. pop out that one and replace it with a new one. My house is about 1500 square feet with only one small area rug. No. it's not great on the rug. But the floors with dog and cat hair. dust bunnies and garden bits tracked in are clean in no time. Then I vacuum the big velvet couch and other furniture. dog pillows. and even the cob webs that appear now and again. This was a marginally careful purchase. My last Mighty Mite lasted for twelve years. the previous one for eight. Hard to look at another brand for vacuuming for me."
2,"The Eureka vacuum itself is amazing.  It is very powerful in such a small unit. It is surprised me at the first time when I used it. There is a small vent hole in conjunction of the handler. I accedentally put my left hand over the hole (I should xeal the hole first). The vacuum suck force made a bruise on my hand.The unit is very convinient (portable). I used it for the hard wood floor and on my Mini-Van. I do not need to buy another one for my mini-van."
2,"I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum.  I hate this vacuum and here is why:  It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic. cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction.  The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air.  The body is cheap plastic.  The unit is difficult to manuever. the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog. 2 cats. a baby. hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it.  I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully.  I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap."
2,"I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS!  It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT!  The on/off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one.  Came here to Amazon. marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history (IN 24 HOURS!) BUT...even though the machine itself does a great job. the parts are CHEAP!  The hose is not flexible. twists all the time. I wish I had saved the hose from the old one; the electric cord is awful. very stiff. very hard to wrap around the handle. and gets easily tangled in itself.  I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just doesn't cut it; next time. I'll get another brand."
2,"I recently put in hardwood floors and was looking for a light vacuum to use that would be quick to get the job done.  This vacuum is amazing! Strong suction. light enough to carry around with one hand. and I vacuumed the main level of my house literally in 5 minutes!  My husband put a strap on it too so I can wear it on my shoulder.  It makes doing the stairs very easy. The cord doesn't retract. which is kind of annoying. but I'm willing to out up with that.  The hose pieces/extender just attach with pressure and a few times they have come apart. but they would likely be fine if I get my husband to push the pieces together.  Overall very happy with this purchase."
2,"I purchased this Mighty Mite to replace one I had over 15 years.  The only things on this new one that even comes close in comparrison are the power of the motor - which is good. and the extension wands.  The hose is so poor quality that it folded and cut off the air flow on my first use!! the housing feels like it will crack if you bump it into something. the wheels are not much better.  The motor makes for good suction. that is really the only positive I can give on this unit.  The old gray model I had since the late 80's was wonderful! I replaced that one with an Oreck. but wanted to go back to something with wheels on the floor for touch-ups. baseboards. overhead cleaning. etc."
2,"I bought this because I have bare floors with just a few scatter rugs.  It works great on the floors. and is easy to move around. with a very long cord.  I would only rate it as adequate on rugs - it works fairy well on low pile. but not well on high piles. and has a very hard time getting cat hair up.  The pieces of tube that make up the nozzle have a nasty tendency to separate. and so I have duct-taped them together.Pros:  long cord. great on bare floors. light and easy to manouverCons:  ability to handle cat hair. deep-piled carpets. tubes don't stay together"
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
2,"The Eureka Mighty Mite is made in China.I bought mine from Amazon in September 2011. so just over a year ago.  It has very good suction. and it is cheap.  The attachments aren't very effective. but overall. it is a pretty good vacuum.  I have a golden retriever. so the vacuum is a little overmatched. but considering it is about $60. I have no complaints whatsoever.I did just buy a more expensive vacuum. which is much better. Mighty Mite is now my teams backup QB. I hope I don't need to use him. but I am confident that if our number 1 goes down with an injury the Mighty Mite knows the playbook. and can perform capably under center.Go Bears!"
2,"My unit is an older model which is called &#34;The Boss&#34; but is the very same as this.  Mine has EXCELLENT suction and I don't mind that it is a little noisy.  Mine is used for cleaning up around the woodstove.  It does an excellent job of sucking up ash and wood particles of various sizes.  I don't understand the negative reviews. unless these people received &#34;lemons&#34;.  I would highly recommend this vac for small jobs. I don't think it was intended to be used for  whole house vacuuming."
2,"This is one of the best household products I ever bought.  This is a very powerful little unit and makes all those hard to clean areas a snap to clean.  I don't know what I did without this before.  From day one it was in use.  I now can get all the floor corners and ceiling corners that were so hard to get with a regular Vacuum and attachments.  And. you can vacuum your car with this too.  You can't go wrong with this canister vac."
2,"This is a great basic vacuum. It is great for my small apartment. I have a low pile IKEA rug and it works amazing on it as well as my hardwood. I like how simply each piece just fits into each other without any buttons to get broken off. My only complaint that it has a little sliding piece to remove big debris before it gets sucked into the accordian part of the hose. That sliding mechanism is great. but it's exactly where you put your hands when you vacuum. So. from time to time it opens and you lose a little suction and it has pinched my hand. That said. i can always slap a piece of tape on that part. because otherwise this vac is so good. Suction is really great. Cant beat it for the price."
2,"We needed a new vacuum and I could not decide on what i really wanted. So far this thing has been pretty sweet for the price. Your are obviously not going to get quiet. super cyclone. bagless. blah blah blah and I was not expecting that. This thing is loud. takes bags and has is not easy to store. But it does the job we needed and that is what counts.I am taking one star off because I really wish there was a place to clip the hose and attachment tubes to the housing for better storage. Other than that. color me impressed."
2,"I bought the Mighty Mite about a year ago and have been very pleased.  On the plus side. it has very strong suction and enough nozzle variety to get the job done. It is light weight and easy to store.  It is perfect for small apartment living. Minor negatives is that the light weight accordion hose sometimes kinks and because the vac is light weight. it will may tip about when you are moving around with it.  There is no beater brush. but the brush on the nozzle and the great suction make up for it.  For what you pay. it is a very good purchase."
2,"I hate. absolutely HATE. having debris on our hardwood floors. So I did a lot of research and found this vacuum. It has a very powerful suction AND it doesn't scratch our floors. It is also lightweight and has a very long cord. So when I vacuum. I usually gently tug the vacuum while holding the hose and the little guy follows me around like a loyal companion. It is very versatile and includes different attachments to suit your vacuuming needs. Changing of the bag is easy and mess-free. At first I thought it would suck having an old-school vacuum bag (unlike today's &#34;just empty the dirt out of the canister&#34;) but NO! It's all super easy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this vacuum."
2,"The vacuum does a good job and does have terrific suction.  But the hose is very flimsy and is constantly getting kinks (which makes it get REALLY noisy till you straighten it out).  Then the wand. right where you need to put your hand to grab it. has a 'Slip Ring' which you can open to reduce suction (like for doing drapes).  Problem is that it's always opening up so you have to stop to shut it.  These two things get very annoying."
2,"I LOVE THIS VACUUM. it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes. Eureka has a winner on it's hands. I especially LOVE the old 'tank' design as opposed to the current square 'canister' design all vacuums companies are now using. Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market. So many pluses  but just to name a few...extra long cord. massive suction. long hose.I only have 1 negative comment:When vacuuming you are restricted to back and forth straight line vacuuming and I could see how this would be an issue for some."
2,"Purchased the 3670G via Amazon. Just arrived and immediately plugged it into my Kill-A-Watt. The device shows amperage draw on anything plugged into it and it shows the Mite is only drawing 10amps.Either I received the 10amp model that other reviewers have posted about (old reviews though... two year old reviews) or the mfg is lying about it's capabilities.Having said all that. it's a nice. simple. lightweight machine that really sucks (in a good way). but I can't help but wonder how much better it would perform if it was truly the 12amp model.If any other reviewers have any advice. please post a comment."
2,"This is a wonderful vacuum for hardwood floors (or tile. viynl ect.) will not work on carpet so don't even try.  Makes handy vacuum to clean up after small projects like hanging blinds(saw dust).We have two dogs and 2000 plus Sq ft of hardwoods in our new home and my wife was going crazy trying to keep them clean with swiffers. bought her this on amazon and recieved it in 2 days (prime) we botha are tall (5'10' and 6'4') and love the long handle no more bending over. wish the brush attachments were better but we have extra from our other vacuums.Again for hard surfaces this is a 5 star all the way."
2,"Bought this vacuum cleaner for those hard-to-reach places which I can't get to with the upright.  The canister is light and easy to carry around. the tools are also very light (to the point of being a bit flimsy) and do the job.  The strength of suction can be adjusted using a simple rotating collar on the tool extension tube but it is not a snug fit so it tends to move rather too easily during cleaning.  The general level of suction however is good and it picks up most dust and dirt without trouble.  It does seem to work especially well on tile."
2,"Nice and easy to handle machine with a strong motor. easy to clean filter and good accessory package.  Overall this is a good little vacuum for cleaning stairs and car interiors. However. it has 2 problems.  First. the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily.  It has no reinforcing. so you don't want to step on it or bend it around a corner.  Second. the hose is a corrugated pipe style with accordion pleats the entire length.  This gives the hose a little strength. but it makes it very prone to clogs and things sticking in the folds.  I have learned to check the vacuum suction each time I use it.  If it feels weak. I need to take off the hose and shake it clean.  In good clean condition. it works as well as any canister."
2,"The suction on this little machine is unreal.  Sure. the parts are made of plastic and with careless throwing around. parts will break.  But if you are careful and don't step on the hose. you'll find this is a gem.  I have no carpets; just 2 throw rugs with non-rubber backing.  The 'carpet' feature totally cleans these rugs.  The floor feature is just what I need for my 2 floors of hardwood.  And the price?  OMG. if it quits in 2 years. I will have gotten my money's worth."
2,"Needed a small. light duty. vacuum for our store.  After checking various reviews. purchased this item from Amazon.  It is compact. lightweight. has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag. which I prefer.  It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord.  We use it for bare floors and low-pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations.  Three minor. non deal-breaking negative elements are - 1) the hose and tubes are friction fit and can disconnect easily; 2) The hose is corregated plastic and seems a bit cheap; 3)the power cord has a wrap-up rather than retractable storage mechanism.  But. the cord wrap-up holder is well designed and located.  I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed.  All. in all. this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive. convenient vacuum."
2,"This is an awesome little machine for the money. Yea... The plastic is a little cheap and it is a little loud but you cannot beat the price or the power. It is perfect for hard surface floors. No it does not leave marks on wood floors. If you drag the cord under the wheels you'll get a mark from the wax on the cord but most people with a hint of intelligence should know better. No the canister does not easily tip over. I honestly don't know where some of these silly reviews are coming from. This is a great little vacuum for the price. If you want perfect go spend two hundred dollars."
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
2,"The vacuum is very light and powerful enough for bare floors. I've owned a few of them. One burnt out because the person using it was trying to save on bags and repeatedly let it get too full.  Another one lost a wheel. but it is so light it is easy to carry. Most of all the light weight makes it so that I am never reluctant to take it out and use it as I might be with a heavier vacuum.  It has a surprising amount of power. but I am not sure you would want it as your only vacuum for rugs. It is certainly not the vacuum you would buy for extensive wall-to-wall carpeting.  The previous ones I've owned have lasted for very many years."
2,"This is my second Eureka.  The first a Eureka  100 - a BIG Floor standing Model.  This died on me after fifteen years.  Was too big and heavy.The Mighty Mite was ordered and delivered within one week.Tried it out the same day - This machine S U C K S !! (I mean the DUST)The lightweight is very handy.  Did my 3 Bedroon unit with upstairs and stairs without much effort.  The extra brushes. and long handle and tubes are very good for window sills and odd corners.  Does hard floors well.The free shippind was a great help.  With a little addition to qualify for FREE SHIPPING - I got the Bissell Featherweight Bagless. which I ordered together for areally great deal.A very good buy through Amazon.  Very Happy with machine. Thanks Amazon for assisting  in the Free Shipping."
2,"I am very happy with this cordless vacuum.  I had previously purchased the Hoover Linx (approx $150) - which I loved.  However. the Linx roller stopped working within a year.  I purchased a second Linx - which also had had a problem with the roller.  So. I began looking for a much cheaper vacuum that would work. but be much cheaper to replace when needed.  The Eureka does not pick up as well as the Linx (which picked up as quickly as a standard vacuum). but it does pick up most items on a single swipe.  Heavier items may need 3 or 4 swipes with a change of direction.  I've had the Eureka for several months and it is working well.  All things considered. this is a much better value than the Hoover Linx."
2,"I've been using this for 1 and a half year.Batteries still charges fine and I can vacuum whole house (1200 sqft) with 2 batteries which comes with the vacuum.It's totally handy and vacuum well for hairs include pet's hairs which I really like it.It doesn't vacuum small rocks nor coins.The handle and the tank became really flimsy after a year of use. the dust tank doesn't fit to the body anymore. so it falls off easily.I am thinking to purchase the different vacuum soon.I hope this review helps :)"
2,"I bought this because my mom had one when I lived at home. and when I moved out on my own. I couldn't live without one. I believe this is the best cordless vacuum out there for the price. (I've tried Shark vacuums and they were awful.) The suction is great. It doesn't miss anything. It mounts easily on the wall. It's easy to dump the dust bin. The battery lasts long enough for me to vacuum three rooms using the carpet setting. I will own one of these for the rest of my life!PS: These make awesome housewarming or wedding gifts."
2,"One messy African Grey together with a kibble-strewing canine in a kitchen where bread is baked 3-4 times a week was driving me nuts. I was so tired of schlepping out the Dyson 2-3 times a day to vacuum the above mentioned mess. The Eureka Quick Up Cordless is my new best friend. It was ridiculously easy to assemble and mount the charger. The bonus battery pack ensures there is always plenty of power to get the job done. Because the Eureka Quick Up wasn't designed to suck the chrome off a truck's fender. don't expect it to take the place of a traditional vacuum. For those little messes that make you tired of dragging out and plugging in the big guns. the Eureka Quick Up is friggin' awesome!"
2,"I have a very large apartment with all bare floors. Once a week I sweep and use a dustbuster to pick up the piles. then wash all the floors using the Twist n Shout mop system. During that week. I use the dustbuster to just go over the floors between washings. Bending over using the dustbuster would just kill my back. I used this machine Sunday for the first time-wow-it's as strong as the dustbuster but I don't have to bend down at all. Today I used it again and got perfect results. I have a 55 lb. dog and it picks up all his hair with ease. I took the handle off and vacuumed my couch. I couldn't believe all the dog hair it swept up from the couch because I didn't even see the hair on the couch and my dog is black. Only reason to keep my dustbuster is to get behind the toilet and my tv stand. The Eureka doesn't fit there. Great Product!"
2,"This little Eureka vac works well for me to pick up cat litter. crumbs. and easily tackles quick clean ups on the hard surface floors around my home. It also works well to get pet hair off both carpeted and fabric surfaces; I've used the beater brush setting on my couch and has the couch looking new again every time. On carpets it does a good job grabbing surface dirt except when *really* close to the baseboards. I find it lightweight and easy to handle for quick tasks.I love that it came with two batteries so it's always ready to go. I don't use the extended handle portions so for me this stores in a really compact space. The beater brush setting can be on on or off. The dust cup is relatively easy to empty.This model provides just enough power for the tasks I need it to do and I leave the bigger tasks to my full size vacuum. Pleased with this purchase and recommended for light cleaning tasks on all flooring types and low to medium height carpet."
2,"It's a stick vacuum. folks. So it won't do much more on carpet than collect surface debris (like any stick vac. it's not designed to. though it does have a &#34;carpet&#34; setting) or solve big cleaning problems. But it will. from solid floors. remove crumbs. most dust bunnies smaller than bowling balls. dog and cat hair. and -- for those like us who have canaries or other pet birds -- all 2.000 feathers that each one of those little darlings drops during their annual molt.What I like best is that this model comes with TWO batteries. so I can keep one in the stick vac and one in the charger so the help I need is always at hand. For the price. I like this machine."
2,"I needed a vacuum but was at a loss because there are so many to choose from.  But one day in the doctor's office. I saw a clip of an asthma prevention program in California and they were recommending Eureka because unlike other vacuums. it doesn't blow the dust back out. Although this is not the exact same model. I like the portability of a cordless and it's a strong vacuum.  I have two dogs and I can get the whole apartment clean and it doesn't even lose its charge so I haven't used the spare battery yet.  It's easy to maneuver and there are two settings. one for carpet and one for bare floors.  It's also relatively quiet."
2,"When this first arrived. I was a bit disappointed by how unsubstantial this little machine felt. but I've just used it for the first time. and the second it hit the rug. I could feel a surprising amount of power. And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power. And when I emptied the dust cup (which was incredibly easy to do. by the way. and your hand goes on the inside of the cup. while the dirt is stuck to the outside. so your hands don't have to ever touch the dust) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up!I have a small one-bedroom apartment with very little storage space. and this tucks away easily behind the closet door.Well done. Eureka!"
2,"We're pretty pleased with this vacuum - it cleans our rug (it's a felt-type of material so it has very little pile) and cleans our wood floors well. I like that it has 2 battery packs - we've never had the disappointment of picking the vacuum up and realizing it's out of charge. The only issue was the first time I emptied it. dust flew all over me when I removed the cup from the vacuum. Also. the screw somehow came out of our handle and won't stay in anymore so the handle is pretty much useless now until we find a nut to use. The brush got pretty wrapped up in hair. but it was easy to cut free. Overall. a solid vacuum. but nothing insanely life changing."
2,"I bought this vacuum to keep bedroom and bathroom floors tidy.  All three people living in my house have long. brown hair and I can't stand when it gets on the floor!  The vacuum works well for touch up jobs. but it wouldn't work for heavy duty clean ups (like our pet rabbits room which gets covered with hay and fur..).  The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was that the hair got wrapped around the roller of the vacuum instead of being sucked up into the compartment and was very gross and tedious to remove!  It's perfect for use on the stairs. however. because it only weighs about 4 pounds!  As for the battery life-- I can vacuum about 2 medium sized rooms and a hallway before the battery wears out.  Definitely glad this one came with an extra battery so it can be switched out if you need to vacuum more."
2,"The vacuum is light weight. and picks up dirt and hair quite well.  It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.  The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.  I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.  The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging. but it's designed for wall hanging. and it slides on the counter. and the shape is not made for flat surfaces."
2,"This is a great cordless vac. I have two dogs and this picks up all the hair without getting clogged! (works great on floors- medium success with carpet so if you have carpet this may not be your solution). I have an Electrolux that was specifically advertised to be good for people with dogs- what a waste of money- it clogs with the first pass- don't make the same mistake.  The Eureka is very reasonable priced and does a great job.  It's also pretty quiet for a vacuum and my dog who is terrified of the regular vacuum is not bothered by this at all."
2,"This vac is amazing for picking up dog hair. broken wine glasses (who said that? :). leaves that blow into the house. crumbs. party remnants. etc.... I can't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you've just mopped - get this! It's a two minute swish through the house and it's all picked up - it's amazing. My son actually loves it because it's 'just his size' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well. if you insist! :)  I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you're taller then 5&#34;5' you will be scrunching yourself to use this. Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg. should man up and make it up to par."
2,"If you've never tried a stick vac. I highly recommend them.  Super great for quick pick-ups or a run-thru when company is coming.  I have owned several stick vacs over the years but this one tops them all.  The extra battery comes in handy and the clear top makes it easy to see when the brush needs cleaned.  Hang this near your mess area and make clean up quick and life simple.  It does a great job on hard surface flooring or carpeting."
2,"First- I love this light weight vac but it does have a couple of cons that lowered the rating.Con 1- has a hard time picking up little leaves or kitty fur ( which seems to tangle up the rollers easily..)con2. Do NOT buy unless you get two batteries. I have tried everything but the battery life is not anywhere as described and if I hadn't received a second battery I probably would have returned this item.The pro is it does still pick up other stuff pretty well and its so light weight .UPDATE:Increased the star rating due to excellent customer support from Eureka direct.  Notified them of the charging issues and they were awesome and provided the type of customer service that we rarely see anymore.  Hoping a new charging unit and batteries will improve the use time  but regardless.. customer serviced  from Eureka has me believing that if I ever have more problems. they stand behind their product"
2,"I have birds. so before getting this stick vacuum. I was sweeping my carpet area every night around their cages. This vacuum works beautifully. and picks up things very well. It's not a &#34;suction&#34; type &#34;vacuum&#34;. but it does a great job mimicking one. The other great thing is this comes with TWO batteries. so you are never without power.  I had a stick vacuum years ago (different brand). and it only had one battery. so if the battery died before finishing. you were screwed. and had to recharge.  With this. if your power dies out. you have another one waiting. and you continue on.  I can vacuum my living room area. the hall. etc.. maybe three nights before it starts to sound low. So it has a good longevity to the battery. Again. I love this thing! I'm so happy I bought this!"
2,"I bought this to clean up the bits of cat litter my cat tracks onto the bathroom floor  when he jumps out of his litter box.  For this it works stupendously.  I haven't tried it on carpet or as a hand-held. but it seems to be durable and have plenty of suction power. and it has brushes you can turn on for use on carpet.  The extra battery pack is a bonus. tho' I haven't run down the first battery pack yet.  The battery seems to last a long time."
2,"I love everything about this vacuum. The mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery. I can do the upstairs and downstairs in a small home one one of the batteries. Really lightweight - easy to pull out and use. I hate traditional vacuum cleaners because of the noise. but this is really quiet and light.It is powerful enough for hardwood floors and wool rugs. I have a shop vac. so if anything major were to happen. it's there. You'd really be better off with a shop vac than a regular vacuum if something major were to happen anyway. Between the two vacs. it's perfect.It's so lightweight. carrying it up and down the stairs is nothing. but if you have the mounting space and a few extra bucks. you might want to pick up a couple of these."
2,"I'll start by saying that I think we may have received a faulty unit. The canister/filter didn't sit right when clicked into place. which may have been affecting the suction power. We ended up returning it.That said. I still would have probably returned this vac even if it wasn't faulty. The reason being. there are much higher-quality vacs available for not a lot more money. We ended up with an Electrolux Ergorapido. which is so much better made in comparison (there is no comparison. really.)Plus. the &#34;handheld&#34; function of this vac is a joke - all you do is remove the &#34;stick&#34; handle. so the head of the vac when in handheld mode is the same huge head as when it is in upright mode. Most other dual-mode models have a removable &#34;dust buster&#34; style vac with a smaller head for nooks and crannies. Not this Eureka!"
2,"I had trepidations about the power of this device. especially since it had a carpet brush.  I thought. as battery powered.at first. something has to give as a tradeoff.....either power or run-time.  Well. all worries came to ease after it's initial charge of 16-hours.  This broom is a little powerhouse.  It is perfect for our use. which is. to pick up stray cat litter.  It not only achieves this. but also serves to pick up crumbs or just about any small items from a hardwood or low-pile carpeted floor.  Run-time is fabulous.  It has run for more than fifteen minutes. with no degradation of power. on the initial battery.  if one has to sweep longer than this. of course. the battery can be changed with the charged one in less than ten-seconds.  Highly recommend."
2,"This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I bought the last one several years ago and it is still running strong.  I wanted a second one to keep upstairs.  This little Quick Up is exactly as advertised. What a time saver.  It is  light and weight has considerable suction for a cordless.  It is a little Go To machine and I think anyone would be glad they purchased it.  This would be a great gift I think anyone would be delighted to receive.change"
2,"this is my 3rd Eureka Quick Pick Up cordless sweeper. They are great for picking up cat and dog hair and light floor cleaning. I use it daily as I have 2 inside cats.. I would not recommend it for heavy duty carpet cleaning as it is not powerful enough to do a thorough job.It's easy to clean the filter cup but is a little dirty to do so. Just empty the filter cup. rinse it out and the container and allow it to dry before placing on the sweeper.I am pleased it has an extra battery. The previous two did not.If you want a light weight easy to use cordless sweeper. you won't be disappointed"
2,"I'm surprised at the power this little cordless has! It picks up the dirt. dog hair and even little pebbles. A single battery lasts a long time. and with the spare battery ready. I can actually keep my place easily quick-swept. (I'm more a gardener. not a cleaner. so if it's not easy it probably won't happen.) Some cons: the filter case is a little difficult to remove. it would be nice if the 'on' button was up on the handle instead of down on the base. and although the stick comes off for stair cleaning. it doesn't have a 'Dust Buster-like' snout like. say the Electrolux Pronto (which doesn't have the same power). It does clean so well. I'd recommend getting a spare filter or two (they're cheap) so you can rinse one out and have another ready. I'm so glad I got this!"
2,"I was totally amazed to find out this uses NiCad batteries that suffer from battery memory and are horrid.  I had to call Eureka and get new batteries sent. the first customer service agent was horrible and made me call back 24 hours later in the event the batteries suddenly started to work.  NiCad batteries are horrible.  The Vac itself is great. but the batteries make it not worth owning.Among rechargeable battery technologies. NiCad rapidly lost market share in the 1990's. to NiMH and Li-ion batteries; market share dropped by 80% for good reason.  With the battery technology today there is no reason Eureka should have used them except to be cheap."
2,"We retired in Florida and about half of our flooring is tile.  We needed a stick vacuum that would properly sweep the tile floor so we could then steam clean it with another device.  It's quick and easy to use and it weighs very little.  When done. we put it on the charger and it is ready for the next time we have a need for it.  It does take about 16 hours to fully charge the batteries. but it's not really  a problem. since we don't use it every day.  The extra battery should come in handy over time. since all batteries lose their ability to hold a charge.  I suspect that it will take a year or two (or more) before we have to buy a new battery. which is available for purchase through Eureka.  This cordless stick vacuum is exactly what we needed and it was a good purchase."
2,"It is so easy to use. I can stand in one spot and vacuum a large area at one time.  Having two batteries is great. as the one in it (not in the charging holder) goes down quickly. but the back-up finishes my house.  Three problems:  1.  There's a screw on the side between the handle and the bottom that won't stay screwed in.  2.  The bristles have to be checked every time to clean it. with my  shoulder-length hair.  3.  The dust holder just barely stays on the unit; the button that holds it in place barely fits right.It was real easy to put together from the box.But it picks up great and fast and easy. and always amazes me that I can make such a mess to fill the filter!"
2,"The biggest problem in cleaning spots and stains out of furniture and area rugs is lugging around a heavy piece of equipment. This Hoover is small enough to carry with ease and fills simply from the top. It even has a  built in mechanism so it can't overflow. I liked its performance overall  and found it as good. if not better then other household machines. Of  course it seems to work best with the cleaner it came with but since it's  an economical product that isn't a problem either. The best feature it has  is two separate tanks which means you won't end up cleaning your sofa with  dirty water. Overall this product is a good investment and pasys for itself  in one use."
2,"With a one year old and two year old around the house. there is no end of messes. spills. leaking diapers.etc. I've used this to clean spoiled milk out of the bottom of our truck. clean up poopie off the carpet. scrub juice off the living room floor and it does a MAGNIFICENT job!! i would buy it a hundred times over. I highly recommend it for small jobs that don't require professional cleaning. It'll definately get you through and do a better than expected job"
2,"No assembly and ready to go out of box.  2 ounce of cleaner and 1/2 gallon hot water to fill the unit through a convenient fill hole.  Unit does not have to be disassembled to empty. a convenient drain spout.After first use. waste water came out black. and an immediate elimination of pet odor in the stairway.Small size and light weight make it idea for immediate spill clean ups.Unit is built top heavy with a large handle. this balances the weight when solution is in the unit.Cord could be longer and retractable."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
2,"Just received my Steamvac Jr. today and had pet stains waiting to be cleaned.  After they'd been around for a few weeks this little device didn't hold back the cleaning power.  Suction is awesome and I was so impressed I started to find things I wanted to clean...couch pillows. etc.  I just couldn't stop!  I'd recommend to anyone who's considering a handy. powerful tool of this nature.  (One note of caution...I didn't have the handles locked down all the way...my fault...and when lifting it off the counter after filling it up. it all hit the floor!!  Be aware of TWO locks. not one...)  It does come with a small bottle of cleaning agent which worked just fine but I purchased one separately anyway.  Enjoy!"
2,"It's does not vac at all.  I am going to get a canister vac like my friends from Eurica. they worked great.  Uprights are always too loud and does not clean well.  My only good vac was the upright that's cordless.  It does not clean very well. but does the everyday job of picking up dirt.  My ex-wife got it and still using it.  I need to get one.  Wasted hundreds on Hoover and Dirt Devil's upright too.  Purchase 3 Hoover in my life time and are not happy.  3 strikes. your out Hoover.  I'll get a Eureka canister vac for sure."
2,"Because of the many favorable reviews I bought this little vac last week.  I also ordered the Advanced Deep Cleaner with protector and I was AMAZED with the results. I've had a beige sofa bed that was dangerously close to be thrown away like garbage after several years of all types of kid abuse. My sofa looks brand new. smells great and it's soft and fluffy.The machine is noisy. but it's not as bad as I expected. The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it. The brush washed away even old ink stains (I soaked them in alcohol for a few minutes before cleaning)Thanks to this little wonder is cheap. easy to use and very effective."
2,"I purchased this timer to replace an earlier version of the same timer that stopped working.  I started out looking for a different brand. but this one was the lowest cost option.The pros:+  Low cost + free Amazon shipping!+  Easy installation & the dial plate fits over the existing switch opening.+  Easy to operate. with the exception noted below.+  Quiet operation... the fan noise is louder.The cons:-  No manual off?  It's odd they removed the manual off feature that we got used to on the earlier version of this timer.-  The knob is a bear to push on & just as difficult to remove!  I suggest installing & removing the knob a few times to loosen it up. before installing the timer.&#9658; Update - January 9. 2014This timer has been working perfectly since we installed it.  We still miss the manual off feature. :("
2,"Easy to install.  Did it myself - female with VERY limited electrical experience but I am good with tools.It works.  We haven't' had it that long so I can't speak to longevity but it is currently doing what it's supposed to be doing.  It's installed in our main bathroom and it gets a lot of use.Directions were very easy to follow and it looks ok when installed. I mean it looks exactly like the picture. nothing fancy or especially decorative.We bought 3 more for other fans."
2,"I bought 4 of these units from Home Depot in 2005 while building a new home; I paid 15 bucks each.  I use them to automatically shut-off three bathroom fans and a laundry room fan (Broan-NuTone QTREN080 80 CFM. 0.8 Sones. Energy Star Fan).  The timer instructions and face plate say to turn the nob passed 10 minutes (at least). which I do.  They still work great after 6 years.They were easy to install.  And they shut-off the fans consistently.  No complaints.  I would purchase one of these again. if it ever failed."
2,"I have been using this timer for about 5 years and just purchased 3 more at the request of neighbors who wanted one for their apartments.  Mine is used to time the hot water heater for my daily shower and has more than paid for itself in savings on the electricity bill.  Previously it was necessary to manually turn on and off the heater and invariably  it remained on longer than necessary. to the detriment of my electricity bill.  The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability.  I realize that nothing last forever. but after 5 years of daily use mine shows no sign of advancing age.Timers are also available for shorter periods. but I see no benefit in buying one of them.  This timer gives me the option of a full hour. but also permits running the timer for any period less than that.If you need a timer. this is a very good choice."
2,"Strong. stable. stackable. 'nestable' - these boxes have it all... except labels.  Would be nice if Akro included a few labels for the front... they do. but they want you to pay for them. so I'll just cut out some card stock.  These also can mount to the Akro wall-system which is nice. and may be the way I build my next garage work bench.  Currently they're sitting on the bench stacked 3 high.  I liked them so much I placed a second order!"
2,"Quick and easy setup -- no installation required. even though it comes with screws. Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary. At long last. i finally have my multitude of brooms/mops/swiffers/dusters/dust pans OFF the floor and out of the way every time i open the closet door. A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality. nice and sturdy. I like that it is white so blends in with my white door. Highly reccommend."
2,"I live in an apartment. so I wanted something that I could hang over the door instead of drilling/nailing things into the wall for me to fill later when I move out. It was really hard to find! This comes with the hardware to mount if you want to. which is nice if/when I go somewhere more permanent. but honestly. hanging it over the door is working great. Why drill holes when you don't need to? It was a little difficult getting the bracket attached to the peg part. I ended up using a hammer which caused some of the white paint to come off. but you really can't see it and it doesn't affect function. I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
2,"We purchased these bags for the first time in May 2001.  I installed a bag and thought it worked OK.  (I did not throw the former bags. not Hoover bags. out.)  The next time the bag needed changing the lady who cleans the house (unbeknown to us) installed the bag we had been using previously.  My wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference.  After a very short time my wife said she could smell the dust when the vacuum cleaner was in use.  I changed the bag in our vacuum back to a Hoover bag and the probem was cured.  While not very scientific. it convinced us.  I have thrown the other bags away.Additional Comment:Because of the small particles that are trapped in the bag. I take the vacuum outside to remove the filled bag.  This prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house."
2,"This will be short. it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums. it's OEM. it works. no manufacturing or quality issues. If your vacuum uses this size. I see no reason not to get it. As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run. and it has been running for over a decade. I will get these replacements. Thanks to Amazon for making these so easy to acquire. would have had a hard time locally. otherwise.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
2,"There was a review titled &#34;Didn't Fit&#34; which stated:&#34;Be warned! If you are looking for the &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; bag for a Hoover Wind Tunnel vac. don't assume a &#34;Type Z&#34; bag will fit....it won't!&#34;I don't doubt the reviewer got a product which doesn't fit.  Maybe hoover does weird things.  I double checked. and the previous bags I used were &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; - the last one is still in the vacuum.  I replaced that one with this Type Z - fit just fine.  So. I'm not sure what happened with the poor fellow which got ones which didn't fit. but worked just fine for me.It's the genuine hoover product. not the knockoffs sold on here as well.  I figured - why bother saving fifty cents a bag or whatever. when these bags last months.  Not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly."
2,"Awesome pick up power for pet hair.  Does an excellent job cleaning carpets.  I would have given it 5 stars but it overheated on the 3rd use.  I e-mailed hoover and they said to make sure  all filters are clean. I discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged.  The new routine is to check that filter when dumping the canister. No overheat problems with a clean filter. The Hoover folks said that the motor needs lots of air flow to keep it cool. Really impressed with how much dirt it removes from the carpet."
2,"The belts as such are excellent but the Hoover keeps killing them every few months.  My wife uses it carefully but the belt is so tightly stretched around the pegs it is bound to snap and thats what happens.  There got to be much better design.  I had to buy several belts and keep in stock but now I am really fed up with the above Hoover vacuum about this!  I have an older Hoover which has been working since 1988 without a hitch. really.  They do not make things like that any more!!!!!"
2,"I bought this vacuum cleaner belt because I do not need it. Have you ever needed a vacuum cleaner belt? Have you ever needed one IN A HURRY? I had a Kenmore that was the best carpet vacuum I have ever seen. but the belt broke. I didn't have another. I put off looking for one. I moved to an apartment with all wood floors and discarded the Kenmore. Now I have area rugs and a Hoover that just isn't as nice and I can't find bags for it anywhere but Amazon. So I bought the bags here. and the belt too because it was inexpensive and I have bad memories of lacking the vacuum cleaner belt. So now I have this Hoover that I hate too. And if it breaks its belt. I have one on hand so I can go on hating this vacuum cleaner for ever. I even ordered a new hose for it."
2,"I have the Hoover Windtunnel Max vacuum cleaner and these belts fit. Buy them in advance. because my vacuum cleaner picked up a blanket and I pulled it out when the vacuum cleaner was still on. You are supposed to turn off the vacuum cleaner. then pull out the blanket. Well. that was one of the first times I vacuumed with my Hoover and it ruined the belt. and I needed a replacement right there on the spot. I had one. because I went and bought this 2-pack along with my Hoover. A good practice."
2,"For some strange reason. I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep if this fan isn't on.  It doesn't matter if it's snowing outside. this fan has to be on.I have been using it for 2 years and it still works great.  I rarely use the high setting because I have a small room. but the low setting is great for sleeping because it isn't very loud.My only complaint. as will ALL fans that I've owned. are that they get dusty rather quickly and are difficult to clean.  You have to unscrew the plastic screens. wipe the fan blade. hose down the screens. and screw them pack on."
2,"i have for over two years the lasko box fan that i use in bedroom and it works very well.but being an idiot when i came to amazon to order another one i was too lazy to look up my old order and ordered this one becuse 'it looks the same'.  its not.  the 3723 model from two years ago is fabulous.. really cools a mid size room.  this newer model you have to be within 2 feet to even feel any aire.  buy the 3723http://www.amazon.com/Lasko-20-Inch-Premium-Box-3-SPEED/dp/B000HHJ2I2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1344856518&sr;=8-1&keywords;=lasko+3723"
2,"inexpensive fan. works just fine. i bought this for white noise when i sleep. and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine. moves air too. but since that is not what i use it for. i can not speak for it's abilities at that task.side note. the fan came packed only in it's original box. and the first one was cracked and broken. i sent it back. got another. and. and. and... the second one was broken also. it didn't affect the fan really. so i called amazon. got a 10 dollar credit. and kept it. they said they would be flagging the company. whatever that means. never a problem with returns etc at amazon. but since this is a review of the product. not the packaging. there is no star reduction."
2,"Nice to see Made in the USA on the outside of the Lasko 20' box the fan arrived in!Delivery was before scheduled and caught me and my two cats by suprize! Cats have nice new box to play with and I have great smooth operating and quiet cooling Lasko 20' box fan just the right size for my apartment. If you run it on the highest speed naturally it is a little louder. This fan delivers the goods.goods in this case being circulating cool air. Appreciate the prompt delivery also. You may wonder why the early review since having the fan only a couple hours.well the reason is I trust Lasko for a good product since my previous fan was a Lasko I have used for the last 10 years! Motor just wore out after good work for 10 years. Thanks Lasko!"
2,"From now on. I'll always look for a Lasko 3733 when I need to replace a fan. I bought my first one 5 years ago and it ran 24/7 365 days a year. It took 5 years of continuous use before one of the ball bearings wore out. FIVE YEARS of 24/7/365 use! This is a superb fan!This fan is very well balanced. It never wobbles or shakes.This fan is not a quiet as I'd like. but then again. I want perfection and that's not going to happen. It  is quiet enough on the slow setting. and making a fan spin faster does nothing to move air faster (believe it or don't. this is pure physics).Cleaning of this fan is very easy. Simply remove the grill screws. then remove the grills. Then unscrew the blade holder. and pull the blades off the spindle. Wash in hot. soapy water. Replace everything. then turn it on so that it drys itself."
2,"My concern while purchasing this fan was air flow.  Needed a substitute air conditioner for the summertime.  Needed something that could create alot of air movement to suck in the cool air at night. and something that could be aimed at me could cool me off during the day. and this fan achieves that for it's lower price.  Box fans are great. place then in a window and they'll cool a room down in no time.  It is not a quiet fan like the ultra quiets on the market today but it is not as loud as those turbo jet fans.  It has a normal good size fan noise that I don't find irritating.  Other than that. you really don't need the foot attachments.  I placed on the desk. turned on high and it did not fall over.  So. to conclude it is a good solid fan for a reasonable price when your main concern is air flow."
2,"I just bought one of these from Target. This fan is LOUD and makes waaay too much noise.  Even at the lowest setting. this fan sounds like an airplane is getting ready to take off.  I'm not exagerating.This fan is LOUD !!!  Forget about sleeping with this fan on at night.  I am even worried the neighbors can hear it at night.The noise is awful --  and a bad surprise when you need to use it. My parents always had a couple of these box fans around and they never made anywhere near this kind of noise.  The construction is all plastic.  They dont make them like they used to.I dont get it -- the electric fan technology has been around since 1900 --why is the product getting worse and more expensive ???Save your money and buy something else."
2,"This is a fine. basic box fan.  I don't want the fan to be too quiet. and this one isn't.  The low is low. and the high blocks out other noises. I use the fan both to move air into the house and to block out white noise. and this one does the trick.But it's a basic box fan.  There is no thermostat. The three modes are not particularly 'whisper quiet'. as I've heard other box fans quieter and less powerful.There's a knob on the top with three speeds and two plastic feet to help keep it from falling over.That's all.Which is exactly what I needed. for about the cheapest price I could find here on Amazon.It's just not really what the description notes."
2,"Mine arrived crushed because there's no package padding (should be double boxed).  I fixed it myself because I didn't want to return it. by bending it back into shape (it's sort of flimsy. so it wasn't hard).  But. it's too loud for the bedroom even on low.  And. it smells of an oil/electrical smell when it is turned on. yuck.  I have it turned on outside to try to work out the smell (no. it's not rubbing or smoking or anything).I'm trying to replace a Holmes box fan that burnt out after years of use.  The Holmes was extremely quiet on low. and had the added benefit of a rotatable angled vent that could blow diagonally from the window into the room at the side.  Sadly I can't find a direct replacement for my old fan. and this one isn't going to fit the bill."
2,"Our air conditioning went out on the hottest day of the year so far. So we bought a few fans so we could survive until we could get someone to fix the problem. This fan is good for putting in front of a window to draw in cool air. It is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler. As far as this having 3 quiet speeds I'd have to say that is not quite accurate. It is not a silent fan as it does make some noise. But for the price it does a good job. One thing however is that this fan scares my cats. It might take some time for your animals to get used to the noise.~The Rebecca Review"
2,"I love this fan. We bought it years ago and have never had a problem with it. It's pretty simple to figure out. It has three settings: High. medium. low. This is great to put in a window to circulate some fresh air. It runs pretty quietly on the low and medium settings but can get a little loud on high (which is kind of expected).Overall. this is a purchase I have not regretted. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a durable fan. You could probably find it a lot cheaper in a local store. I got mine at Dollar General."
2,"For years. hubby and I have bought Lasko fans to keep in our bedroom.  This is our third one.We use it to keep the air circulating and for the white noise to help me sleep.None of the three that we've owned have had any whining. squeaking. rattling or weird noises.  Just a nice. smooth hum.It does blow hard.The first one died because I let it get too dusty.  The second one lasted for 7 years and I only replaced it because my son needed a fan and I wanted a shiny new one for myself."
2,"I have been sleeping with a box fan in my bedroom  year round for many. many years and have owned several different models but this one tops them all. I can turn up my thermostat in the summer and still stay cool and comfy. in the winter it helps  circulate the warm air in the house. I have a teenage son at home and when he has friends who sleep over they can be a bit noisy sometimes. However. with my Lasko fan turned on the number 2 setting I don't hear them and my son's bedroom is right across the hall from mine. This being said. if you are looking for a quiet fan then I suggest you buy another brand. However. if you want to lower your electric bill and block out noise then this is the one to buy. You can't go wrong with this Lesko!! I reccomend it highly!"
2,"I. like many people. have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep. I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted. I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new. I use mine and my son uses his. every night on low when we sleep. All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be. According to my kill-a-watt. this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low. You can calculate more from there if you would like. My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually. The only problem is like all my other fans. the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago. I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home."
2,"I have had my WM 6qt for 11 months. The ice cream was great but the motor has stopped working. BE AWARE THAT AMAZON only warranties this product for 30 days. The manufactures warranty for the motor is one year. I now have to go to the hassle of contacting White Mountain and securing service for a product that they did not sell to me. I anticipate issues. For a unit that cost this much the seller should back it for the indicated periods.White Mt was very easy to deal with and did replace the motor. I only gope is that it last longer. Great Ice Cream."
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
2,"This is the real thing! I have tried other ice cream makers and this thing worked flawlessly out of the box and makes real ice cream even in a hot and humid environment with ambient temperatures of about 33 degrees Celsius and  85% humidity in a RESTAURANT kitchen and I have been using this everyday to make at least 2 or 3 batches everyday!Would definitely recommend it. A durable item that holds up in today's disposable times. A bit on the loud side as in other reviews but in a restaurant kitchen. who cares as long as it does the job reliably!"
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
2,"I didn't fully realize how nice this peeler is until I was at my mother's over Christmas and tried to use two of hers.  They were slippery. dull. and they HURT to use!  I had never understood that one peeler really could be better than another before that.This peeler is comfortable to hold. even at the end of a big job like peeling apples for a pie or potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner. It is sharp. so you don't have to use a lot of pressure. which also helps decrease hand fatigue.  All-in-all. a good product.** Update 8/18/11: I'm back to purchase two of these as stocking stuffers for my mother. No excuses -- now she can throw out those peelers that have been hanging around since I was a kid. . ."
2,"I love this peeler!  I had one just like it for many years (until I somehow lost it!) and it worked perfectly EVERY time.  I couldn't remember where I bought it and couldn't find another one in any stores - until I finally looked on Amazon.  Thank you. Amazon!  Not only is the gripper handle perfect. the blade works as it should.  I purchased a couple other peelers during my quest and I was very disappointed.  Their blades kept slipping over the vegetables without cutting.  Very frustrating.  I even tried a kitchen Aid brand and hated it.  So save yourself the frustration and the tired hands and just buy this one!"
2,"As with all OXO Good Grips products. the handle on this peeler is great.  The blade. however. is less than 2 inches long. making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes. though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers.  Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating. rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers.  In short. this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."
2,"Just like the last post. We had one of these for years. Ours too suddenly disappeared without a trace!  How wierd!Anyway. I went to my local walmart and they did not have this same model. so i settled for what they had in stock. Needless to say. I returned that piece of junk the next day. got a refund. And found one of these at another local store!  I couldnt believe what i had taken for granted in this potato peeler!It is still very sharp after years of use. the handle is very comfortable and the swivel on the blade works perfectly.I dont know what the diff is between this model and the $12 model also made by Oxo. but this one is fantastic!You will get years of use out of this peeler. untill maybe the aliens decide to snatch yours too!"
2,"I've long been a fan of OXO utensils but I didn't think there was a good are bad when it came to peelers. I was wrong. I cook quite a bit and had used a peeler recently at my brother's house. When I got this one and used it. it was like night and day. It is surprisingly effective in peeling as if it were super sharp. but I've run it into my hand on accident a couple times and never been cut. There's something about the design of the blade that makes it pretty safe to use and still really quick at peeling. It also comes with a nifty plastic blade cover that I use to protect the blade from dulling in my utensil drawer. Nice little feature."
2,"If you're not a cook. then you probably won't have a use for this. but anyone in the search of a superior vegetable peeler. look no further. I've had mine for over two years. and it's working as well as the day I purchased it. It doesn't dull. it peels efficiently. it's safe. light. easy to handle. easy to clean. and doesn't rust. It works well with potatoes. carrots. cucumbers. and zucchinis. I've never tried chocolate. though. It's crazily cheap that you should definitely give this product a try. I promise you won't be disappointed."
2,"Peeling has never been more fun!  I love this peeler. It is super easy to peel any kind of fruit I want. I'll never go back to the regular type of peelers or God-forbid dangerous knives. I like peeling potatoes. apples. and carrots.  Sometimes. I buy root vegetables just so I can peel them.  This peeler is ergonomically comfortable. I can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands. (I wear size XS gloves.)  It's not hard to clean either. I just rinse and wipe. along the grain. using a sponge. That does the trick.  I've had this for months and so far no visible grime has built up on it.  It is rust free as the day I bought it.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I am recommending it to you."
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
2,"I'll be honest; I don't get much exposure to a great variety of vegetable peelers. but I would hazard a guess that this is one of the best.I bought this based on the other good Amazon reviews and have not regretted it. Its sharp and very efficiently does its job.My sister came over for Christmas and after using it on a few dozen vegetables was so impressed that she went out the next day to find one of her own. I have a reputation in my family for buying the best of the best. no matter the cost. so she was very surprised to find this peeler was so cheap.Buy it. it just works."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
2,"Bought for 3rd time in November 2012.  Due to misadventures in moving we have had to buy this exact product 3 times.  The grip stays in hand with no slipping even if hand gets wet while using.  Peels excellent with little pressure.  My gal friend has rheumatoid arthritis and this is the only style she can use.  Got stupid once and bought the Kitchen Aid red colored one just because of the color and regretted on 1st use - handle was uncomfortable. slippery. and blades would not peel properly.  The OXO is easy to use. easy to clean. very reliable product and company.  Amazon price slightly better than any other store we researched."
2,"Like many of the &quot;Good Grips&quot; products. it's really astounding how much better this peeler is than &quot;traditional&quot; peelers (you know. the all-metal. slightly rusty thing that had been in your utensil drawer since you bought at at the supermarket when you were stocking the kitchen for your first apartment).  This inexpensive gadget produces much better results. much faster and more comfortably. than any other peeler I've ever used.  It works equally well on potatos. carrots. apples. etc.  It's cheap ($5-$6 for an essential kitchen tool you'll own for years) and works great; why in the world wouldn't you buy it?  If you cook and you don't own one. stop reading and buy one now.  It's a no-brainer."
2,"I purchased the OXO Good Grips Peeler back in 2000 and I have been using it ever since with no problems whatsoever. I originally bought it to replace the peeler that came in my Culinary School tool kit. That peeler had broken after only a month of use. But I have used the OXO peeler ever since. going on 5 years now. It feels great in my hands and peels potatoes. carrots and other vegetables perfectly. While I was in school my classmates were constantly borrowing this from me and asking me where I bought it. Even one of my Chef instructors loved it and would use it from time to time. If this peeler were to ever break on me. which it has shown no signs of doing. I would not hesitate to buy another OXO."
2,"Yup. this is a great peeler.  The handle is sturdy and feels good in the hand.  The 'grips' help avoid slippage with your wet. kitchen hands.  Swivel action helps when peeling uneven surfaces (think potatoes).  The guard over the top of the blade aids in gripping and safety.The peeler I had before this was some cheap little thing I got at the grocery store.  It's definitely worth a few extra bucks to get a real peeler.  Especially if you love sweet potato mash as much as I do!"
2,"This is the best peeler I have used!  I have one and have given them as gifts numerous times. The grip is comfortable. the peeling action is smooth and quick and it just is a joy to use.  What more could you want? My wife  has carpal tunnel and loves the whole line of OXO products. but this one is  our favorite. Even my 11 year old daughter begs me to use it when I peel  vegetables.This is the last peeler you'll ever need!"
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
2,"One would be surprised how rare it is to find a peeler that is actually easy to use. The grip has to be just right. the peeling head has to swivel not too much and not too little and its edges have carry just the right amount of sharpness. I went though a number of peelers which I all eventually abandoned in favor of my trusted knife. However. once I got my hands on one these OXO ones. I never used my knife again.Nowadays. that seems you cannot go through a single day without coming across Food Shows. this swivel peeler is a must in every kitchen.RECOMMENDED."
2,"The day I got this peeler. I compared how it peeled side by side with my other swivel potato peeler. just like an infomercial. or something. The size of the pieces that came off when peeled with the new one was incredible. It takes no time at all to peel a potato. whereas I had to spend at least 10 minutes on it before! I'm surprised that most swivel potato peelers don't have any kind of grip on the handle. because after any length of time. holding it can definitely be hard on your hand. It peels carrots equally well. and it makes cooking much more leisurely and fun."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
2,"I purchased this years ago and have loved it from the start... It's so comfortable to hold. works in both directions - peeling away from your hand or towards your hand. We use it on cucumbers. potatoes. and carrots. Takes off just the right amount of peel with each swipe. It has held up fine in the dishwasher and seems to be still sharp enough. probably 15 years after we bought it... LOVE IT and would highly recommend. The lines you see on the sides of the handle are great for gripping and compress as you squeeze them. so even with wet hands. the peeler does not slip!"
2,"I have about 5 different peelers in my drawer. my last favorite one was similar but the cheaper $1.99 version from walmart but they don't have a higher end product like this. However I love the previous one. it came to rusting due to its cheaply made metal I think. So I'm seeking for a better replacement. I do like most of OXO products like can opener. wine opener etc... One thing I didn't like about previous walmart version is that it peel a bit thicker than I want that it take away more than I want just the fruit's shield. This peel was great. peel thinner. exactly as I wanted. But I hope it'll last much longer for its price and brand that doesn't rust out like the other one.Best peeler I ever have. this would probably a good gift for mother's day."
2,"meh.. it's alright...  Does it peel?  Yes.  I've had mine for a few years now and even had them sharpened.  So. how much can there be to a peeler to make a difference enough to say 'oh yeah baby peel baby peel'?  Not this peeler.  In general I like OXO stuff for their grips and that's about it.Rather than just complain.  Allow me to point you to a peeler that has me reeling peels.Messermeister Peeler Trio SetThe Messermeister is a much better peeler in that it requires hardly any effort with the standard peeler.  It comes individually or as a trio pack.  Of the trio the standard and serrated peelers are the most often used.  The julienne peeler not so much but consider it a freebie at this price.  nogo on this oxo."
2,"I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.  And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.  Everything came out nicely and neatly.  All it took was bit of turning and pushing. and then the whole core came out like a beauty!  I just love it!  Plus. it saves so much time.Yes-- the handle/grip is absolutely well designed.  It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all."
2,"Apple corers have always been a pain.  The kind wth the handles that you center over the apple and push down into wedges...those just don't work well.  If the core is off center. you end up with a difficult cut and having to pare away the core from the slices.This Oxo Good Grips Corer is nice.  The trick to using this one is to twist as you push and yo get a much cleaner coring.  I used this and then slice the apples into rings...my kids love it."
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
2,"I absolutely love this corer! It's incredibly easy to use. and the best part is that it doesn't seem to have any sharp edges I can cut myself on. Clutz-approved! Despite lacking sharp edges. it still cuts through an apple very easily and without a lot of force. OXO handles are great. as I have quite a few of their other products in my kitchen. and this has lived up to it's non-slip standard. If you miss getting all the seeds out the first time. no worries! It comes out as easily as it goes in and and you can try again. Just try not to get too crazy with it. or you'll end up with a bunch of apple cylinders and no apple left!"
2,"I have several OXO Good Grips gadgets in my kitchen and I find they are consistently well designed and do the job they are meant to do and do it well. This corer is right up there with the best of the OXO tools. The handle is large and sturdy and helps me get a good grip so I can get the core out with one motion. I have really bad arthritis in my hands so if this tool did not perform well. I'd be looking for a replacement.I find this size takes out just the right amount of core. I tend to buy organic when possible and those apples are generally a little smaller than conventionally grown ones. This corer takes out just enough so the seeds and little tough seed casing is removed without taking too much of the apple flesh.Very pleased with this product and happy to recommend."
2,"Before buying this product. I used an apple corer and divider. I hated using it because I'm petite and it would take me 5 minutes of using all of my strength to core the apple and have it cut into wedges. I am starting to eat healthier and decided to buy this apple corer to see if I liked it better. I love the OXO Good Grips Corer! It takes just seconds to core the apple and the core is easy to remove from the corer. The handle is comfy and easy to grip. Cleaning the corer is also easy. I use this to core small and medium-sized apples and the core comes out completely. However. I do not think the core will come completely out with larger-sized apples because of the size of the head. Overall. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,"I followed the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated in buying this. The corer is so much better than the half circle corer I used growing up. Solid handle is easy to grip and gives you enough torque that it feels almost effortless to use. The hardest part is aiming the thing so it goes through the center of the apple. Also the size of the core extract is a little on the small side for the biggest apples. A little of the core is left in the apple. but for normal store sized apples it works great. Highly recommended!"
2,"This is an easy corer to use. You push down on the stem end and punch out the core of the apple. Peel first or not. Sometimes you get a wonky apple and the core misses a few seeds but that can be handled when you quarter the apple (a bit of trimming with the paring knife.) This is fast. I used to have one of those slice-and-core type corers but this is so much better. It's more compact in the tool drawer and it works a lot better. It's actually faster and cleaner to use the paring knife to cut the apple wedges if that's what you want.The handle is nice and grippy and thick for a good grip as you push it into the apple. and the blade is sharpe enough to easy penetrate the fruit and push out the core. I use this all the time."
2,"I bought this originally to core and fill cupcakes. This tool is great for this. You can remove the core of a cupcake and the cake will stick to the inside of the corer and easily pull out of the cupcake. Then you can use your finger to push the core out of the corer. Then fill your cupcake (with marshmallow cream. or cherry filling. so many yummy options). We also have used it to core cucumbers (and fill with herbed cream cheese). Of course coring apples is easy too. One thing I like is that while the tool isn't exceptionally sharp. with a bit of pressure it easily cores items. I like that it's not a super sharp tool. but rather serated to cut through items."
2,"I've seen different products for apples and onions that look like they do the same thing.  I needed something for both and this fits the bill.I roast and smoke apples and onions both (not together...) in the grill and in the smoker all the time.  Some of my more popular and requested items actually. so I have a need for this in more than just one way.To core your apple or onion. if it doesn't simply push straight through. all you have to do is twist it slighly back and forth while pressing down.  It cuts cleanly and doesn't take out too much either. no real waste to speak of.  For larger items you may need to go through it one more time taking out the extras but for regular or medium-large items this takes everything out in one push.Works perfectly. has a 'good grip' per the name. is very solid and cores easily.  Highly recommended kitchen gadget that will certainly get its uses around my house.-D"
2,"I use this tool every day and love it. It's very well built. simple. functional. easy to use. and only takes a few seconds to clean. What more can you ask for? It's really a time saver and makes eating apples more enjoyable because you don't have to deal with the seeds. It also cores pears.To use it all you do is line up the center of the apple. apply a little pressure while turning the handle slightly and it takes out the core with very little effort. If you love apples and pears. this is a must have tool."
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
2,"This bottle/can opener feels just like the OXO Good Grips vegetable peeler.  Its black. rubberized grip has a section of 'gills' that molds to your grip for better control.  When you're done. just pop it in the dishwasher.  The only drawback is that with long term use. the 'gills' sometimes break off.  It took years for that to happen to mine (only one section).This is hardly an elegant device. but it works well and is perfect for everyday and outdoor use.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
2,"I picked up a OXO Y-peeler. like the above model. except with a red inlay on whim in Krogers. about.. 5 to 6 years ago? I still have it and it works great! Tried to take good care of it.This peeler is perfect if you have Big hands. and want a functional peeler. and want to peel manually like nobodies business. Used to use a peeler. that wasn't a Y shape. but was just straight with a long U shaped point blade. My hand cramped up so bad all the time! And I'm a young guy. So I got this and have never looked back.I absolutely love this kitchen tool!Anyways. this will be a good investment when peeling potatoes or carrots. Haven't really used it on anything else."
2,"Switching from vertical to horizontal took a little getting used to. but I love this peeler. I had a similar one when I first married but lost it in a move or something early on. I'd thought several times I'd get another. because I did like it. but didn't get around to doing that until the old wooden vertical one finally wore out. I really like it. I especially like the little scoop on the side that lets you scoop out potato eyes while you're peeling. Nice feature. Comfortable to grip. like all OXO products."
2,"I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to &#34;Y&#34; peelers on another website. That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available. I was delighted to find OXO made one. OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle. With my other peeler. my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes. I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler. The &#34;Y&#34; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control. The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp. I'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools."
2,"does exactly what it is supposed to do. as a child i watched my grandmother use the old fashioned peeler. she could and did peel apples do the skin came off in one long  sheet. she wasn't showing off. she just had the mastery of the tool. when i needed a peeler. i automatically went with the same old fashioned peeler. i'm not sure when i finally had the chance to use one of these &#34;european&#34; peelers. they are perfect. they do exactly what a peeler is supposed to do. peel stuff quickly and easily. with emphasis on easy."
2,"I love this peeler! I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash. but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes. turnips. carrots. etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition. but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area. most stores carry only the swivel version."
2,"I got both this peeler and the OXO Pro Y Peeler. This is a very good peeler. It is much better than my old Zyliss peeler which I used to think is a great peeler compared to the nobrands I used before. HOWEVER. After using the OXO Pro series - this does not compare. I would therefore give it 4.5 if I could and not 5. (Or I should give the Pro Peeler a 6...) Bottom line - it's a good peeler. and does the job for the price. BUT - If you can spare the extra few bucks. the Pro is just a league of its own."
2,"I have a million peelers. Okay. not a million. but at least 5... and they are all terrible. I was a little skeptical to get this one. because why would this one be any different. Well. my friend brought hers over to my house when we were preparing food for a friend's party. Amazing. First of all. the grip is so comfortable! Fits my hands perfectly and doesn't hurt my hand (as much) when peeling a thousand potatoes... or carrots... or cucumbers. Second. one slice and the peel is gone! No going over the same  spot seven times! I love it so much. I went out and got my own. and those other five peelers went straight to the garbage."
2,"The handle sure is comfortable. just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber. it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip. the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid. non-damaging material."
2,"I've gone through two of these and won't purchase another.  The first one broke after using it a three or four times. but since I like Oxo products in general. I assumed it just a fluke. The second one I simply threw away. As other reviewers have pointed out. it uses tiny. metal teeth to grip the lid. which slip and could conceivably cause injury. It was worthless. so I'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a  spoon.  Works better than Oxo. that's for sure."
2,"This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower!  I was sick of using those rubber pads; not only did they tear easily. but also they didn't work very well.  So far. OXO's version has been a big improvement:  the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids. and with a simple twist. the lid is off cleanly and neatly.  I have found that the unit can sometimes slip. especially with a very small lid. but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface. you should have mostly success. as I have."
2,"Bought this six years ago to use instead of the under-cabinet one that was already installed in my kitchen. The under-cabinet one was better at unscrewing a lid. but occasionally the jar would slip out of the vice and my hand would get pinched.  Well. this OXO opener proved to be a disaster in every way. Like other reviewers noted. it doesn't secure well enough to the lid. slips off the lid. and hurts your hand when it gets slammed into the jar. I'm surprised no one has sued the company for manufacturing this awkward. uncomfortable. dangerous product."
2,"I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed.  It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble.  The opening is way too big to accomplish that so. back it went to the supermarket.  I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't. I am rating this only one star."
2,"This scoop works great. I first tried the pointed ice cream scoop and  couldn't use it. I have problems with my wrists. I have used other Oxo  tools and love them. so I tried again with this scoop. It works so well it  seems to be designed with me in mind. It is easy to dip out even the  hardest ice cream now and the bail pops the ice cream out of the scoop  --clean as a whistle. You can wash it in the dishwasher too."
2,"The metal scraper loop that expels the ice cream is unbelievably flimsy and very tenuously attached on both ends. Although it worked well as a muffin disher. it deformed and popped out the first time I tried to scoop ice cream from a batch I made that was frozen just a bit over soft serve (I would never use ANY sweeper scoop - even well-made ones like theNorpro 3-Tablespoon Stainless Steel Scoop- to dish ice cream any harder than that). Waste of money. Look elsewhere.And for dishing ice cream only. of any degree of hardness. try theZeroll Original 3-Ounce Aluminum Ice Cream Scoop."
2,"I really didn't expect much from this scoop except a fatter grip. which I need due to a hand injury. I had no great expectations - a scoop is a scoop. right? Well. not in this case. The scoop is well balanced and light weight. and easy to grip. It produces nice. even servings of ice cream instead of clunky chunks. I can get great leverage. Somehow this tool makes scooping even the hardest ice cream easier. and I never need to run it under water to soften the ice cream.  Maybe it's the pointed but not sharp leading edge of the scoop that cuts right into the ice cream. Maybe it's the leverage you get from the thick. non-slip grip. I'm just happy it makes serving ice cream effortless."
2,"I was so happy to finally find an ice cream scoop that doesn't break or bend awkwardly after only a few uses. This scoop is very sturdy with a big comfortable handle for those of us with big hands. I like the shape of the scoop itself. it's a little sharper and flatter and really does a nice job digging into the ice cream. Be careful though because this digging can lead to you puncturing the bottom or sides of the container. I would have given this 5 stars but after a month or so these little bumps began to form on the finish of the inside of the scoop. These bumps don't impact the function of the scoop. but they certainly don't look that great."
2,"My son works at a ice cream shop. and when I recieved this ice cream scoop. he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work. Until he actually used it. It looks metal. but feels like it's plastic. When I used it for the first time. I was scooping out very hard ice cream. and it felt like it was going to break. I had to turn it in circles to get anything. I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one. At least I know it won't break in my hand."
2,"I've come to expect solid. well-designed products from OXO. and this ice cream scoop did not disappoint me. From the comfortable black rubberized grip to the heavy stainless steel scooper. it's quality quality quality. I tried it on hard ice cream. and it does scoop it well...but don't expect to get by with no elbow grease. Hard ice cream is hard to scoop! The angled edges of this scoop are helpful in breaking the surface. and the narrowed/pointed end works great for getting into the corners of ice cream boxes.I like the black-and-stainless color. too. which works well with the rest of my kitchen. And. going by my usual 'what else can I use this for' approach to anything I buy. I think this would be good as a transplanting tool or. in a pinch. even a melon baller."
2,"OXO makes nice kitchen products that are reasonably priced and are of a high quality.  This ice cream scooper is another example of this and is a nice purchase.  The primary distinction between this and your average scooper is that this one has pointed edges.  This makes it easy to get the ice cream out of the box. especially when it's hard.  It also helps with getting to ice cream out of the corners.  My only con of this scooper is that due to the shape. you won't be able to get perfect round balls of ice cream.  Of course. that is a minor issue and shouldn't be a reason to avoid buying it."
2,"The good is the handle.  It is very comfortable to hold and to use.  The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff. frozen ice cream.  I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just couldn't compete.  The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand. but it was an effort to achieve results.  I wouldn't say it was any better than average.  The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch.Disclosure:  I have no connection to Tupperware"
2,"This is the worst ice cream scoop ever. The part of the scoop that attaches to the handle is only about 1/4 inch in diameter. It's a total scam; they made it look thicker. by making the part that holds the scoop 4 times as wide. You can't tell by looking at it. because they have cleverly disguised it with the plastic handle. I found out when the handle broke off in my hand. while trying to scoop some hard ice cream. Oxo. you should be ashamed of yourselves for making this piece of junk. which was clearly designed to deceive the consumer. I'll likely never buy an Oxo product again."
2,"This scoop has a comfortable handle and a good shape for attacking hard ice cream straight out of the freezer. The chrome finish is attractive and seems like it would be more durable and dishwasher-safe than the ridiculous (and unnecessary) non-stick finish I have on my other Oxo scoopOXO Good Grips 26481 Nonstick Beak Ice Cream Scoop. I prefer to dip this in water before use (so it will glide through the ice cream). and to wash it by hand afterward. This isn't an all-metal scoop. like theOXO Good Grips Solid Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop. so I'm a little concerned about its longevity."
2,"Good grips utensils have always been one of my favorites because of the large comfortable handles. I already had a good grips ice cream scoop. but got another one so I would always have one ready when i got an ice cream craving. I was surprised when this one arrived to see the shape of the scoop had been improved. now the end has a rather pointed tip. and this is GREAT! it makes scooping into hard ice cream a lot easier. This scoop puts all the others to shame. I it is now the first one I grab when i need to scoop ice cream. I also use it as a serving utensil if I am serving mashed potatoes or foods of similar consistency and it works great. You will like this scoop. there is not a better one around."
2,"My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using.  Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time.  This scoop works so much better. even without running it under hot water first!  The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material. and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me.  i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream.  Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!"
2,"It's been a month and so far. so good. with this OXO ice cream scoop.  The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold.  Also. the handle shows no sign of separating from the metal scoop part. so I'm happy about that. and the shiny finish on the scoop is smooth and blemish-free still.  We're washing it in the dishwasher. so I will update if there are any longevity issues with this ice cream scoop.All in all. if you need an ice cream scoop. this does the job nicely.*Update: February 2012*  It's been 8 months. still looks like new."
2,"This scoop has a nice edge to it that lets the scoop dig down deep no matter how hard your ice cream is.The no-slip grip on the handle is easy to grasp and not nearly as thick as some I have tried.I would of given it the full 5 stars if I could make it scoop out perfect balls of ice cream but either there is a trick to it that I haven't discovered yet or my ice cream is frozen too hard.All things considered. this is a quality item that will get lots of use in most kitchens."
2,"This is a good ice cream scoop if you're just looking for something at a reasonable price and is very comfortable.  I think those are the two biggest advantages of this utensil.  The bad thing is that it's not the most durable.  For the most durable. you'll want to look for a one piece metal scoop.  This one works best if you dip it in hot water first to heat it up and then scoop out your ice cream.  This will make the ice cream a little more easy to handle as the tool can kind of melt it's way through.  Dip it back in the hot water before each scoop.  This tip can be applied to all ice cream scoopers."
2,"I'm a long time fan of Oxo products. but this isn't one of my favorites. Based on an earlier review. I bought this to use with cookie dough as well as ice cream. The dough sticks so badly that I need to use a rubber scraper to get it out (doesn'5t matter if the dough is room temp or cold - I've tried it both ways). Furthermore. after about 6 months of use. the handle seems to not be fitting tightly with the scoop. and feels &quot;wobbly&quot;. It's also not all that easy to get clean. The lever portion is hard to get under and closes so tightly that just tossing it into the dishwasher doesn't do the job. It's going to be replaced - just don't know if it'll be replaced with another type of Oxo scoop or another brand.  I"
2,"My favorite dish brush.  When the price took a big dip I bought several.  They will last a long time too if you don't use it on hot pans and store with bristles up or not resting on anything that flattens them.  Run through the dishwasher monthly or sooner.  The large diameter handle fits my XL hand well.  If the price is around $5 - 7 jump at $10 no way?  But if ten is nothing then go for it.  I have not found anything better."
2,"I've had this dish washing utensil for about 5 months now and have put enough use in with it to give it a solid 5 star review.Unlike sponges or scour pads. this brush does not get old. the bristles stay intact and do not pull out like I've seen with other brushes and it is the perfect size for cleaning both dishes. pots and pans but at the same time being small enough to fit into glasses and mugs in order to clean the bottoms of them as well.Really glad I decided to go with this OXO good grips product based upon reviews which I had seen on Amazon.  I like this brush so much I wish I could give it as a gift to people (without the implications that they need to clean. as I've learned. cleaning devices do NOT make good gifts)!"
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
2,"I had a great little OXO brush with a suction cup that stuck to the side of the sink that finally needed replacing.  Sadly they don't seem to make that kind anymore.  So I replaced that with a longer handled brush and liked the price ($4.50 as an add on item) and the reviews.I wasn't sold on it the first use. but then I started getting more comfortable with the different style. and I like it.I would have liked the bristles a little closer together. but I figure I'll buy another round dish brush if need be.  It's great for glasses and even for scrubbing pans.  There is a soft plastic scraper tip for caked on stuff.I hand wash 75% of my dishes. so I use dish brushes a lot.  This is a good value dish brush and I am quite happy with it.  It's not worth paying $10 - $15 for a perfect brush when this is really good for a lot less."
2,"The bristles are quite firm for a brush of this type but they're spread out.  That's ok IF you use this brush to remove food from utensils prior to placing in dishwasher.If you're trying to clean pans though. this brush won't be perfect.  In that case. consider a brush just meant for that purpose such as this one:Cuisinart Round Head Brush.  Black.I recently discovered the advantage of using both kinds of brushes depending on what I'm doing.  This way. the kitchen brush isn't ruined trying to clean pans and other hard-to-clean items.  The sacrifice is having to keep two brushes handly instead of the simplicity of just one. but I found it better this way."
2,"This item just arrived yesterday. I am so happy that it did. I looked at the 'tired' dishrag being used and quickly disposed of it. My family finds the brush easier to use and 'polishes off' the dish-washing vigils with the dishcloth. Weekly bleachings of the dishcloths eventually wear the rags out. The dish brush replaces the harshness of scrubbing to remove dried or sticky foods from dishes. pots. and pans without damaging them. No more rusty or unraveling scouring pads either. Easy to clean and comfortable in the hand.This brush is sturdy and the bristles appear to be well-rooted in the base. Only time will tell! For now. I am satisfied."
2,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later. and with CONSTANT. REGULAR. FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen. the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most. thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle. not the black/white one shown in the photo. so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
2,"I had just remodeled my kitchen and got a brand new black apron style kitchen sink. Could not bear the thought of buying another $1 brush that would tear up in two week.s like the other two dozen. in the 'use for the outdoor' bin.  I thought I was splurging to by an 'expensive' kitchen brush. but good grief. this thing is still in pristine condition. There has been no problem with bristle breakage. smell. mold. handle wear. etc.  I never imagined it would hold up like it has.  So definitely worth the small investment. Save yourself the aggravation of replacing a brush constantly and go with the quality. I mainly use this for prewashing dishes before they go in the dishwasher. but also can use it on pots and pans. I've not needed to buy an extra one for any other purpose. I do agree that the bristles are widely spaced. but this has not interfered with my daily use of it."
2,"I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs.  I have only had this brush a few days. but find myself using it constantly.  It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal. cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood. and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices.  The brush can be put in the dishwasher. or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes. This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task.  It is definitely a good value for the price."
2,"I have always felt that OXO is hit and miss with quality.  I have tried several of their kitchen brushes over the years and this one is pretty good.  It has a strong handle and I suspect it will last more than 6 months.  At the same time. I'll probably replace it before then for cleanliness purposes. since the head isn't replaceable.  Regardless. it's cheap and does the trick.  Good for general cleaning of dishes. etc. but not for the true elbow grease stuff."
2,"Bought this just to get the 25 dollar free shipping. and am back for another.  This is by far the best dish and mug brush I have ever had (mind you I am not really a kitchen-y type).  Anyway. I've had it a couple months now and am impressed after using it to scrub the rings (that never come off in the dishwasher) off coffee/tea mugs. cleaning pots. etc.  Usually with other brushes the ends of the bristles get 'mashed' looking fairly quickly. but this is holding up well - even after my son cleaned mud. spider webs and other debris off an old army helmet with it - (which is why I am buying another)."
2,"I purchased this brush for the sole purpose of cleaning out my cast iron pans.  The last brush I used was from the dollar store and didn't last very long.  I like that this brush has the tips that branch out at the top. making it easier to clean around the rim of the pans.  I cook everything in cast iron nowadays. and the best way to get out tough residue it to fill the pan half way with water and bring to a slow boil.  from there the brush gets all of the tough stuff out. Then I sent the pan back on the stove for a couple of minutes under heat so the condensation evaporates.  then I spray with oil and let cool so I can store it.  Overall this is a very nice brush for the price.  I think it will last loner than the last based on it's construction."
2,"It was time for a new paring knife...  I do own quite a few.  This is the one for paring apples and most fruit. It feels like an extension of my hand when paring.  The other paring knives clean wax out of candles now.  The professional series works for me.Immediate update. I meant to post this under the 3-1/2 'professional' paring knife.  It's the same price and has a much better blade. I have owned this one and it's great for sliced a sliver of cheese out of the frig for a midnight snack.  Check out the professional one. it's only $6.99.  The 4' one is $14.99...that one I would have to think about.OXO Good Grips Professional 3-1/2-Inch Paring Knife"
2,"I suddenly had a need for more paring knives so I decided to buy four various models on Amazon to try them out.  This is by far my favorite.  They are extremely sharp and the rubberized grip is very comfortable.  When I reach into my drawer I tend to want to grab this knife over the others but have to tell myself to rotate through all of them.  I've had it for over three months now with use almost every three days and so far no sign of any type of oxidation or staining.  I wash it in a dishwasher all the time as well."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
2,"I don't have a complete knife set and was tired of ruining loaves of bread with my dull chefs knife and other basic kitchen knives.  In all honesty the main reason I purchased this particular knife was that it was the cheapest.  Having good luck with other Oxo products previously purchased. I wasn't to hesitant to purchase yet another.  It has a sharp serrated blade and a comfortable handle that have easily handled all of my bakery cutting duties (bread and bagels mostly).  This knife is also nice for heavy skinned fruits. easing through pineapples and cantaloupes.  It has also stood up to the dishwasher rather well.  You will not be sad with this knife and will be happy with the outcome of every cut you make."
2,"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.  A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs. and this knife does just that.  It has the nice 'good Grips' handle and is a good length.  It is nice and sharp and for the price. I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.  It is not the fanciest knife I own. but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.  Good. basic bread knife!"
2,"Cutting bread without a bread knife is futile exercise. This bread knife works well and is very inexpensive. The blade is only about 8 inches. so it is not quite long enough to cut bread from a bread machine if the loaf is placed on its side.  I thought I had to get a longer knife. but then I figured I can stand the bread up so that it is much narrower.  That works. the knife is now long enough to cut very thin slices of bread that has about the same thickness as the Wonder sandwich bread that I used to buy in grocery stores."
2,"We have owned a couple of bread knives.  All were serrated knives. but not all cut bread well.  The OXO (and we love that brand!) is a favorite.  The handle has a good grip... made of a harder rubber or plastic.  It is also a well balanced knife that holds comfortably in both my hand and my wife's hand.The best thing about this knife is that it cuts.  It cuts soft bread. hard bread. bagels. etc.  Like with all good bread knives. you have to let the knife do the cutting and not push down.  This one works like a champ!"
2,"I needed a good bread knife that would easily slice artisan loaves.  After reading the reviews. I purchased this one.  I like the fact that it is sharp. but I wish it was a longer length to handle wider loaves.  And I prefer a knife with more weight to it.  This one is very light weight. so at times the slices are not uniform....one side will be thinner than the other.  It's like the knife is a little hard to control.  However. it cost so little. it was worth trying."
2,"I have recently started making all my own bread and love it.  BUT - I hated cutting it!  I could never get it even and always smushed it.  I started using an electric knife and that worked better but I hate pulling it out every time I need to slice bread.  So. after some researching. I decided I needed a &#34;bread&#34; knife.  I looked at several and decided on this one due to price.  I didn't want to spend much and then it not work.  WOW!  I have used it almost every day since it arrived.  It cuts bread perfectly - straight and doesn't smush it!  I love this knife and now I don't hate cutting bread :)"
2,"I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6&quot; utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy. it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife."
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
2,"I bought a sandwich knife years ago. and loved it so much that I wanted another one. I  bought one of these knives and loved it so much that this is my second one.The rubbery substance the handle is made up gives a really secure grip and makes the knife easy to handle. The edge is serrated and will cut through most things that you'd want to cut with a sandwich knife.The blade can hold a lot of jam. mayonnaise. or cream cheese. and lay down a nice thick layer of what you're spreading. but still lets you put a thinner layer if you want.It's the easiest to use sandwich knife I've ever had."
2,"I LOVE this spreader - I bought one to try it out. despite some negative reviews.  I thought. it's only $5. I'll try it.I haven't had any of the problems that others have stated.  I don't take it apart for cleaning. and I haven't seen any rust spots.  I just throw mine in the dishwasher.After using spreaders from Pampered Chef. I much prefer the Oxo spreader. as it's much stiffer & able to scoop better.  Very useful for peanut butter. cheese spreads. cream cheese. etc.  I like it so much. I'm ordering more."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
2,"This is not a kitchen essential. but I love it.  I only bought it to take advantage of the 4 for 3 promotion. and as it turns out. I use it almost everyday.  I have had it for over a year. and it still looks like new.  I rarely use the dishwasher. so I wash mine by hand.  I probably wouldn't bother putting something like this in the dishwasher anyway.I like to bake. and I use the spreader to spread butter over the dough for cinnamon rolls. spread pizza sauce over pizza dough. and I have used it a couple of times to put the frosting on cupcakes.  What a great tool for 5 bucks!"
2,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered. as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use. peeler away from you normally.  Great control and the blade is sharp as can be. making a carrot easy work.  The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.  Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large. comfortable. and steady."
2,"I bought this set when I first moved into my apartment. as I've been a fan of the Good Grips products for a while now. This set is absolutely indespensible. as I use these tools almost every day.Peeler:  This is wonderful for peeling potatoes. as the easy-to-grip handle and swivel blade help you to comfortably maneuver around bumpy and slippery surfaces.Knife:  Since purchasing the set 4 months ago. my knife has stayed incredibly sharp and is able to cut through everything from crunchy carrots to smooshy tomatoes.Here's why the set didn't get the &quot;5&quot; rating: The pair should be hand washed and *not* put in the dishwasher.  The knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle. Note: This was easy to correct with a Brillo pad and a little elbow grease.However. I don't think you should let this &quot;diswasher drama&quot; sway you from purchasing this set. as the benefits *far* outweigh the limitations."
2,"Meat Tenderizer OXO / B00004OCJJIt always feels odd to rate minor kitchen implements as 5 stars. but this OXO meat tenderizer definitely works the way it should. The spiky end pokes holes in the meat nicely and the flat end flattens out thick chicken breasts in no time flat. It's fun to use (or at least I think so!) and it doesn't require a huge amount of strength. The grip is comfortable and doesn't lend itself to flying out of your hands. It's easy to clean - meat doesn't cling to the spiky end - and while it probably isn't rated for dishwasher use. that never stops me from throwing it in anyway. and I've had no problems.~ Ana Mardoll"
2,"I love OXO utensils and have many of them.  But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher.  Pound raw meat; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water. right?  The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum.  Now this one looks like old aluminum--it's gray and nasty looking. Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel.  It's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils."
2,"I saw all the warnings about this item not being dishwasher safe. I saw the sticker on the flat side of the mallet. Good to go. as I hand wash my dishes. After having used the thing and cleaned it right after I was done. one evening when I was tired I simply I tossed it in with the few dishes and utensils soaking in hot water. Big mistake. After that. this thing was ruined. It should have been obvious. Why would something not be dishwasher safe? The high temperatures. of course. I knew not to put it in the dishwasher. but I did not want chicken juice getting crusted on the thing and so I put it in with everything else to hand wash.Simple mistake. Cost me $15. Save yourself the trouble and try to find something that is stainless steel."
2,"I am yet another fan of OXO Good Grips products.  The meat tenderizer is another good product.  It is very ergonomic. and it's heavy/solid so that you don't have to pound as hard as you would with more lightweight tenderizers.I don't like the fact that you can't put it in the dishwasher. but really. scrub it with some anti-bacterial dish soap and you're all set.  After shopping at several home product stores in search of a tenderizer. I came back to the OXO Good Grips because I found it the best. in spite of not being able to put it in the dishwasher."
2,"My last masher (from a respected and pricey brand name) couldn't take the pressure-literally!  One day I'm just mashing up a batch of potatoes and *snap&#34; it's time for the trash bin.  That's why I bought this masher from OXO.This one is a solid. heavy-gauge steel wire that goes all the way up into the sturdy handle.  I'm not sure I could break it if I tried!  Works great at mashing (just as good as one with square or circle holes). and the large grip makes it easy to hold even if you get a little butter on your hands (trust me. I have done it)."
2,"Sturdy metal potato smasher. which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.  We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef. ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat.  It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network. and once I learned this trick. it really made that step in cooking so much easier.  Also. we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.  Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat.  It just makes sense."
2,"For my husbands and I's first Christmas I asked for a potato masher. He got this exact one and I can say that I've used it once a week for 10 years and its still perfect. The handle is just fine and it never rusted or anything. I love all the Oxo products. they really do last years and years. I've bought other companies products for the kitchen and they fall apart. is I specifically look for Oxo Good Grips whenever I go get a kitchen gadget because I know it will last for years. One tip. after you mash the potatoes rinse off the potato from the masher because once that potato dries it takes alot of work to remove."
2,"This is a great. old-fashioned style of potato masher. which produces the type of mashed potatoes I remember from my childhood. What it has. though. that ones from many years ago did not is the OXO ergonometric design. with a comfortable handle. It also contains a hole at the top of the handle for hanging on a rack.This is excellent not only for potatoes. but for apples. carrots. various kinds of squash. turnips and other soft-cooked fruits and vegetables.The masher is made of durable stainless steel that helps you avoid rust."
2,"I purchased Several OXO Good Grips including a Lemon/Lime Reamer. Cheese Plane. Wire Potato Masher and Box Grader.  They were all reasonably priced and are made of good quality material.  The potato masher is the best that I have ever used and I use it for everything.  I like to mix bell pepper and onions in ground beef instead of using a large spoon.  Add a can of black olives in the mix and mash them up also.  I would recommend this brand.  The handle has a nice grip and is nice and soft.  I considered this brand because I have the wire whisks and other products by OXO."
2,"I made the pefect lumpy potatoes with this.  Sounds odd. but that's what I wanted.  I have a ricer. but I wanted the mashed potatoes from my childhood.  I went out and bought this specifically for the task.  I have no regrets or complaints.  The handle felt fine. better than what my mother used to have.  I remember hers having more mashing surface. but that may be because I was young.  This one seems compact. so it works fine for a small amount of potatoes in a smaller bowl (perfect for me.)If you want ultra smooth. this isn't the product for you.  Get the Oxo ricer."
2,"So far I have to say that this is the best masher I've ever had. and at 65. I have had or used any number of them.  The &#34;wire&#34; portion is solid. sturdy and will never bend.  The handle is long. has an adequate circumference and is padded. making it easy to grip and at the same time. comfortable.  To top it all off. the end of the handle has extra padding on it so when you bear down it doesn't feel uncomfortable.  Great product and worth the price!"
2,"Bought this to replace a similar one I'd had for many many years.  I really liked the old one. but had repaired the handle many times & it was now beyond repair.  Wish I'd bought this one sooner!  The soft grip is wonderful. & the ridges on the working surface make it glide thru the cheese much easier; no more bogging down. no more  bunched up cheese slices.  Just a nice. wafer thin piece of cheese that does not stick to the plane when you try to take it off."
2,"My husband doesn't mind this. but I hate it and won't use it.  I will grab the pairing knife if our traditional stringed cheese cutter is dirty. before grabbing this.  It is too flimsy in my opinion (surprising really for Oxo). to do its job. and it very difficult to get to the end of your cut without removing a whole CHUNK of cheese from the end.  I guess the other reviewers are right - you are either one who loves cheese planes. or you don't :(."
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
2,"Heavy. smooth action. sharp.  My husband makes an ultra-deep-dish 'priazzo' about 2 inches deep. and this cuts right through - extra pepperoni. extra veggies. extra cheese. extra thick crust. it can handle it all!  Plus. it feels good in your hand.  Nice piece of equipment.Update 7/3/12: I suddenly realized a couple of weeks ago that this wheel wasn't working as well as it used to. so I decided to sharpen it for the first time. It was a little tricky to run through my Chef's Mate. but it's working a little better now. I'm thinking I'll need to replace it in a year or so. Still. it was used about once a week for about 4.5 years; if I get another year out of it. that's not too shabby!"
2,"OXO makes great products at a great price.  It is that simple.  I am sure there are better products out there at four or six times the price. but OXO makes the best stuff at the best price - it is that simple.This pizza wheel is excellent.  I have read other reviews where people moan about how large it is.  These people are idiots.  First of all. it says before you buy it how large it is. so these people are either too stupid to read or too lazy to read.Second of all. one of the reasons why I bought this is because it is large. and the weight makes it easier to cut through pizza.Some people who reviewed this said it was not sharp when they got this.  I admit this might be a pain to sharpen if it was dull. but mine is sharp so no problems there.A great product."
2,"I don't know what I expected but this pizza wheel is large! But it is also the best we've owned in the past 25 years. It rolls easily and with the sharpness of the wheels blade it'll cut through just about any kind of pizza you want it to.The grip (like on all of the OXO Good Grip items) is excellent. and it is made to last. High quality construction. great blade. and grate grip. and great price. What else can I say.I would recommend it to anyone."
2,"I have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult.  This has great grip. great balance (it looks like it should be off but it's not).  Super cutting edge - one pass cuts even thin crispy crusts - which my old cutter took several passes to accomplish.  It's heavy but really well balanced so I think that combination might be what helps it to cut so well.Would buy it again & highly recommend it.Note - it is big - think they said 4'.  Most pizza wheels that I've seen are much smaller.  I had to find a new storage space for it but totally worth it."
2,"I finally broke down and got one of these after getting fed up at dragging my knuckles through the pizza with my old. small wheel cutter. Boy am I glad I did! This cutter works sooo much better. I don't know if it's sharper. or if it's because it has more heft. but it cuts right through those pizza crusts. like a charm.  I have also used it to cut pastry and dough and it works really well at that. too. Finally. it cleans up quickly easily. Definitely a great gadget every kitchen should have."
2,"This pizza wheel is so much bigger and nicer than the little $2 pizza cutter I had that I uploaded a picture for comparison.  First of all. it's huge and makes quick work of even your deepest deep dish pizza.  You hardly have to apply any force at all.  It has a very nice weight and quality feel to it.  I hand wash and dry this so that it will last a really long time.I have been adding Oxo kitchen tools to my arsenal over time. and it has become one of my favorite brands along with KitchenAid. Cuisinart. Calphalon. etc.If you are willing to pay $12 for a pizza cutter you won't be disappointed with this one.  It may be the last one you buy."
2,"Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss. and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement.  I landed on this one!  And then it came in the mail.  Great quality. expect it will last five times longer than our first (somewhat cheap) one did.  BUT.  This thing is giant!  Do you know how big four inches is?  I may just be really dumb but I've never seen a pizza cutter this big for home use.  It looks like something you'd use in home defense.  Who needs a pot when you've got a gigantic sharp round blade to swing? Seriously. I didn't know I'd have to lock it away from the children. but I really don't think it's safe to leave in reach of even our oldest.  It works great. though.  I guess it's for serious pizza eaters."
2,"when given the choice. i always buy oxo. it's the most comfortable for my hands. this pizza wheel is great. sharp. and cuts clean. and i found it for a steal at ross dress for less at $3.99!!!!!! would i buy it at amazon for the inflated price? uh. no. even if i didn't find it at $3.99. i would have bought it at bed. bath. and beyond for cheaper with their 20% off coupons. amazon. if you want to stay competitive. price your items lower!"
2,"A pizza cutter isn't something you think about all that often until you need one. Well. I did. Not only does Pizza Hut never cut my pizzas all the way through. but frozen ones don't come with any slice cuts at all. So you gotta have one of these. My old one must have been about as sharp as a spoon because it took many. many rolls across the pizza surface to make a cut. Missed a lot and created too many super narrow slices. This little guy does it perfectly in one pass. so I'm a fool for having waited so long to buy one."
2,"This is my second pizza cutter in my entire life. It is everything I thought it would be and more. I love the grippy handle and the huge wheel. I use it on my home made pizza. Yes. I make the dough from scratch along with everything else. It cuts my dough to perfectlion. I don't buy pizza from the store or from chains. so I don't know how it would work on other pizzas. I think that if it was used on store-bought pizza it might be comparable to cutting through a cardboard box. That is not what this item is designed to do. Use a box cutter for that. Overall it is highly recommended by me. Keep in mind that I also make whole wheat dough and like it extra crispy. It does beautiful job."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
2,"This must be the worst product I've ever purchased that sports the OXO label. And I've got a lot of the stuff. and have been generally satisfied with it. I needed a channel knife. wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife (instead of pulling it long-ways towards you--look at other channel knives. you'll know what I mean). This gadget cuts the raggediest. least-attractive lemon twists ever. and it's hard to pull through the rind as well. So I thought OK. it's still a good zester. And.....No-it's-not. Get a microplane. or maybe a different zester. but this one is a turd. Finally. the handle is not 'comfortable.' it's too hard and too big for my (fairly small but not outrageously so) hand. The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy."
2,"I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 for any of you who care). I have only about 1/3 use of my hands and about 1/2 use of my arms. but I can use this zester--not with great ease. but I can use it!  I cannot use any other  zester I have tried.My mother has mild arthritis and she likes my Oxo  tools better than her own (even the ones she's grown to love over the  years).The zesting blades are sharp and at the perfect angle.  You get  perfect zest with little effort.  And you get NO pith (bitter white  part).As with almost all Oxo tools the design is excellent: it is highly  ergonomic--it fits the hand and works the way it should."
2,"Most kitchens probably do not have a lemon zester as a routine item. but the OXO zester is a must for both casual and professional cooks. The problem with most zesters is they aren't sharp enough to properly zest only  the lemon peel but instead give you white pith along with the zest. But the  OXO only gives you the best of the lemon as it stainless steel blade cuts  sharply and cleanly. Another excellent feature is a built in garnishing  tool that allows you to cut designs into citrus fruit thus giving you two  kitchen gadgets for the price of one. The zester is quite durable and goes  through the dishwasher quite well too. This tool is also extremely safe for  even the youngest of hands as its slip proof construction allows you to  grip it easily without fear of slipping and hurting oneself. So add some  zest the OXO way!"
2,"I don't know if other zesters would be better. as I have not used any prior to purchasing this one.If this is going to be your first zester. I recommend this one. This is my first and I appreciate the price and quality. It makes the job very easy and the size of the zest depends on how big your strokes are. You can make them pretty small too.Other reviews make a good point emphasizing that it does miss some spots. I feel like it's a very minor thing though and many zester will miss pieces too. but don't get this product if you are aiming to get 100% of the zest. It's not a big deal for me personally though as I feel like it misses less than 10% so I can always get another fruit out.MAIN POINTS: Easy to use. easy to clean. great zest of varied size. but does miss some zest. Overall. a great product."
2,"Before purchasing this nifty little zester. I would always leave the zest out of any recipe that called for it.  Whenever I tried to use a grater. the colored zest would stick inside the holes.  If I kept on grating until the zest came out the other side. then I'd also get bits of bitter pith that would ruin the taste and the recipe.This tool makes perfect zest that includes only the flavorful colored part of the citrus peel.  You run it lightly over the surface of the peel. and it makes ultra-thin strips of colored zest.  The tool is easy to control. and a snap to use.  I use mine to make non-bitter-tasting orange. lemon. and lime zests for homemade sorbets. ices. and ice creams."
2,"Every chef says the best mashed potatoes are made with a ricer so I treated myself to this one.  I found the handles a little uncomfortable...silicone or rubber on them might help.  Pressing the potato through isn't as easy as chefs make it look but I found if I put the bowl in the sink and then leaned the lower handle on the sink and pressed down. it was much easier and kind of fun.The potatoes came through very fluffy but really once you add the milk and butter. they become creamy so I don't know about this 'fluffy mashed potatoes' I keep reading about.  But using the ricer is much more consistent than mashing...not a chance of lumps so they're very very smooth.  I'd definitely recommend this product."
2,"I had my doubts about this item because it felt a little flimsy when I removed it from the box. It's lightweight and the handles seemed a little small. However. it worked flawlessly and made super-smooth mashed potatoes. It's very easy to press the potatoes through the holes.The only downside is that it takes a little time because you can't fit a whole potato in the ricer. you need to cut the potato into workable chunks. and it's a little bit messy. But the consistent smoothness is well worth it. I liked this much. much better than a standard masher.A couple of tips: make sure you use soft enough potatoes (I used russets) and place the potato so that the peel faces the top. not the holes. You also must remove the peel each time you press (that's where the messy part comes in.)Recommended!"
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"I honestly only use this ricer on potatoes. and only after my 'food mill' has done all the work. yet has left me with a few hard scraps that won't pass through the blade.  I place the scraps into the ricer and voila. no wasted potatoes.I was watching Chef Michael Chiarello on the Food Network and this is the exact model he uses on his mashed potatoes. It's construction is solid and smooth.I myself do not make spaetzle. so I cannot comment on its uses for making that dish; however. for making potatoes. when combined with the food mill. it serves a purpose for me. If I could only afford one tool for mashed potatoes. I'd opt for the 'food mill'."
2,"This tool is a must-have for preparing mashed potatoes. It takes all of the effort and lumps out of making perfect mashed potatoes.A little bit of potatoes can squeeze out from the top of the lid as you push it down (which is why I only gave 4 stars) but since the gap is so narrow. what squeezes out is also 'mashed' so it can be thrown in with the rest of the potatoes.My girlfriend complained that it is a little hard to squeeze when packed to the rim with potatoes. but this can be controlled by putting less potatoes in it each time.Overall an excellent product. Very easy to clean."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
2,"I find it hard to imagine how I've done without a potato ricer all my life!  The Oxo potato ricer is a great size for one to two people (though it would also work well for a larger crowd on special occasions. it would just take a little longer) and is well constructed. I found six medium potatoes made a nice bowl of mashed potatoes for two. I didn't mind not having the interchangeable disks. the size of the holes on this ricer were just the perfect size to make nice. fluffy Yukon Gold potatoes. I even threw two cloves of garlic into the pot with the potatoes. then riced them along with the potatoes for a very tasty bowl of garlic potatoes. I'm seriously impressed with the Oxo potato ricer and highly recommend it!"
2,"Great little kitchen gadget. Simple. well made and should last a lifetime when used properly. My wife is really happy with the contraption. it makes it a lot quicker when making cakes. pies etc to rice the fruits than cutting. squashing. smashing etc just insert and out it comes all uniformly so that it can be easily folded into your mixes.Originally was purchased because she wanted to make her own hash-browns... Been over two weeks... Still waiting on them.I have learned that whenever the wife wants a kitchen gadget to always search Amazon first. The heck with going to stores. calling around or asking. IF you can't find it here. you probably cannot find it in a store. It is usually MUCH cheaper to order online than driving around searching or waiting for hours for someone that has no clue what the item is or IF they even have it."
2,"It's a ricer. there isn't a lot of magic going on here to report on.  It's basically a large garlic press that you can use to make smooth mashed potatoes. assuming you don't know what a ricer is.The quality of construction is good. the ease of use is good. and the price is good.  I wish there was more to talk about. but the device is just too simple to get really in depth.One down side would be the ricer could be a tad bigger so you can rice more potato at a time. but its not bad.I would buy this again."
2,"Because my daughter is a HUGE fan of mashed potatoes I finally broke down and got a ricer for perfect potatoes every time.  I LOVE this item.1)I boil my potatoes with the skins on until they are very tender.2)I rice them one at a time WITHOUT removing the skins. The flesh drops into the bowl of butter and cream below while the skins stay behind in the ricer (and typically stick to the plunger. so I simply nudge them off into the garbage between potatoes.)3)I toss the ricer in the open position into my dishwasher and forget it!4)I give the potatoes a quick stir and voila!  Rich. creamy. smooth mashed potatoes with no peeling. dicing. or beating with a cumbersome electric mixer.Maybe ALL ricers perform this well. but honestly. this item is the best.  I am so happy with this purchase."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
2,"OXO designs great products and this is no exception.  It does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top.  I just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease.  I liked it so much. I bought one for my aunt.Before this. I made mashed potatoes with a masher; the difference is unbelievable.  I kept my masher because I'm a Southern girl and sometimes I want lumpy mashed potatoes.This is easy to clean -- throw it in the dishwasher."
2,"I first bought this to squeeze out the juice from potatoes when making hash browns but its first use was actually making mashed potatoes.  For that purpose it works great. mashed potatoes are very fluffy using this and it is very easy to use.  My kids love watching me make it and like using it themselves.  The plate that mashes down on the potatoes is not a very tight seal so you will have some small amount of potatoes that squeeze through the top part. but it's OK. I just throw those in with the mashed potatoes as well because they come out mashed.  It is pretty easy to clean as well. I just use a strong stream of water into the &#34;cup&#34; and then the other way from outside through the small holes.  Then I do a quick wash with dishwashing detergent.  Definitely glad I bought this!"
2,"I have heard for quite some time how wonderful Potato Ricers are. They process the Potato in one squeeze. and prevent over mixing and creating glue when using a stand mixer. I decided to see for myself if I preferred riced potatoes. The first time I used the OXO Ricer. the Potatoes came out creamy and delicious. The texture was different than whipped Potatoes. and the flavor was more &#34;natural&#34;. I didn't need to stir in as much butter or cream as I usually would when I used the stand mixer. I now use the Ricer every time I make Mashed Potatoes. and really enjoy this new method. The OXO Ricer is easy to use. easy to clean. and the padded grips prevent hand cramping if you are processing a larger batch. - Highly recommended."
2,"Prior to recently I did not have much experience with potato ricers but when reading about different gnocchi techniques they were regularly mentioned as providing smooth and even potatoes and other vegetables of the like.  I was a bit hesitant to purchase something that seemingly accomplished one task...mashing. which is something I have been able to do with a masher or a mixer.  Regardless I took the plunge and I must say it has been a worthwhile purchase.This ricer produces consistently smooth potatoes.  I have also used it with sweet potatoes. acorn squash. squeezing liquid from spinach and grated jalapeno and to juice lemons.  It has done all of these effortlessly and consistently.I find myself using it at least once a week while preparing dinner. often times just to make mashed potatoes for one.  It allows me to make what was once a relatively involved side dish in under two minutes of active kitchen work.I plan on gifting a few of these in the coming months."
2,"I was helping my niece set up her new home and we were trying to buy a lot of things for not that much money.  I think it's so important to have good knives - but when I went looking - the really good ones were SO much money.  I decided to try this pair because of the name - OXO - I have loved every one of the products I have purchased from them - and the price.  Well. I was so impressed. I had to buy a set for myself as well.  These are the knives I reach for everyday.  My expensive set of knives are on my counter. but the convenience. comfortable feel and the good job that the OXO knives do - they are the ones I use most often.  At this price. I can't imagine any home without them!"
2,"A very nice set - the only complaint I would have would be not so much a complaint but an observation that the cracker is seemingly designed for larger shells.  It is not as effective for smaller pieces unless you place them and attempt to hold them in place right in the middle of the unit where the two pads come together and actually make contact.  It is very heavy duty and comfortable though and does just fine.  The only modification I'd recommend to OXO would be to design the cracker to come closer together at the hinged end.  I'd still get it again though if anything happened to it."
2,"We have two and have given 2-3 as gifts. Everyone loves them. They are solid and sturdy. Just the right weight. So far. no rusting or chipping. They feel good and are easy to use.The crackers work much better than the ones we've had for 30 years (and which probably cost 99 cents at the time). There is no wobble in the hinge and the large middle cracking area is perfect for just cracking crab and lobster legs without crushing them.The picks are well made. The forked design works much better than the curved single-tine picks and the spoon scoop end easily finishes the job.This set is expensive. Many sets are available for half or less. That's the reason for only 4 stars. I have not compared the quality of the cheaper sets. so maybe these are really worth the extra. I'm glad we have them."
2,"I have used a P38 for over 40 years; I find it to be light weight and ready to use at a moment's notice.However the Oxo good grips will hold the can in place while opening the lid. Not being on the chain. you can also open it with your arms extended; this comes in handy when you are opening cat food.  This also does not require you to be so dexterous.  Your finger does not become calloused.  And it does not get lost in the dishwasher.Just be sure while the cat is sniffing the can. that you don't grind his whiskers.GI - P- 38 - Can Opener"
2,"We got rid of the automatic can opener because we wanted one that could easily be cleaned after each use.  We do not put the Oxo Good Grips into the dishwasher. but we do rinse it after each use.  After a few years use. even tho the blade itself has no rust. the recessed screw area and portions of the handle has rusted badly.  You'd think that it would not be that costly to use stainless screws. washer. and nuts. and it would certainly improve the quality greatly.  It works easily and smoothly enough. even though it is a little bulky for smaller hands and in the drawer.  We thought that by purchasing one of the more expensive brands. it would not rust. so that part is disappointing."
2,"When I was a kid. my parents went through more electric can openers than I care to count; high complexity. dubious reliability.  The run-of-the-mill manual openers weren't much better; they would usually slip. failing to turn the can and open it.Enter the GoodGrips can opener - I picked one of these up over a year ago. and it's functioned perfectly ever since.  The all-stainless construction means no fear of dishwashers. though you'll want to keep metal utensils from banging into the blade.  The rubber handles are very comfortable. and the big fat plastic crank handle handily rotates the can with no contortions whatsoever.  Simple and inexpensive but effective - I've been very satisfied with this product.In fact. it was so good I gave one to my mother. and she hasn't complained about it a bit!"
2,"I bought 3 of the Oxo Good Grips can openers.  We kept two and gave my son one.  The first one died within a month when the black plastic tip broke.  We used the second one and again the black tip broke leaving it useless.  When I warned my son about the black plastic tip he told me that a chip broke in his but it still works.We are now using a cheap $1.99 pair we bought from Walmart. At least it opens a can. that is more than I can say about Oxo.OXO Good Grips Can Opener"
2,"I have owned this can opener for 3 years now and I am still mostly happy with it. It features comfortable rubber grip handles and an ergonomicle hand crank (my favorite part). Due to the design. I notice less stress and strain on my hands and wrists using this product than I had with cheaper models. I have not noticed any rusting or other problems as far as functionality is concerned. The rubber handles have loosened a bit and slide down occassionally. but this has not been problematic as of yet. All and all it has been a good product and if I ever needed a new one. I would be willing to buy this same model again."
2,"OXO Soft-Handled Can Opener. Item # 28081. This is a hard-to-clean kitchen tool. Not all the metal parts are stainless so they get pitted and retain food particles. Also. the soft handles are not sealed onto the body of the can opener. so dishwater accumulates in them. and therefore so do rotting food particles. mold... you get the point. It is possible to pull off the handles and wash all the surfaces. but what a pain! And then. the handles wear and loosen so they start to slide when opening cans. After three months. I replaced the Oxo Good Grips Can Opener with aZyliss Lock-n-Lift Can Openerwhich. after six months. still works very well."
2,"I have a philosophy that will not allow me to buy crummy tools. Tools for anything.... if they do not work or do not last. they are worthless. That's why I paid 14 bucks for a hand-operated can opener. Being an engineer I looked at the design and was impressed by the symmetrical (rather than cantilevered) hinge. I reasoned that this would make the opener sturdy and allow it to work as intended for a long time. IT DID NOT. This overpriced piece of trash DOES NOT open cans. There may be other uses for it but opening cans is not one of them. That's why I'm on Amazon today. I am throwing this junk out and buying 6 of the 2 dollar can openers. That should last me my lifetime and leave 1 or 2 to bequeath to my survivors. Yes it is making me depart from my lifelong philosophy (and that makes me mad) but it is in self-defense. I am hungry and I CAN NOT OPEN ANY CANS."
2,"I've had them all!  Wood. Plastic and Aluminum and I prefer the Aluminum type.Even though the wood works a little bit better. it's harder to clean and after a while it starts to look gunky and unhealthy.  Hard to wash the wood after it's been used a while and the wood is no longer smooth.  No matter how hard you wash. it still feels slimy and that's what bothers me.You may have to work a bit harder with the plastic or aluminum but when you wash them. they're clean and they feel clean."
2,"The Good:  These tongs are cheap and adequate.  I needed a long pair of tongs with metal ends to work in the grill and hot pans and this this did the trick.  They open and close with ease. just like the smaller versions you can buy.  Additionally. arms of the tongs are well made.The Bad:  The ends of these tongs are very thin and mine came twisted a slight bit.  It all gave the impression of being slightly cheaply made. but for $15 you get what you pay for."
2,"...the spring rusts. I own both the 12' (for normal indoor cooking) and the 16' (for grilling). I have used both countless times. They grip food well and you feel as though you have a firm hold of the hood too. In all the times I have used them. I have discovered two main flaws. The first flaw is the flexibility (bend-ibility)of the 'hands'. the part of the tongs that actually touches the food. If you grasp the food too tight. they bend. This means the they will not close tight without bending them back into shape. The second is the metal used in the spring. This metal is prone to rust and when it rusts the tongs no longer have their normal spring and often get stuck. My advice would be to spend a little more money and get a hight quality."
2,"Searched high and low for the perfect tongs for non-stick surfaces that didn't cost a fortune and of course found the OXO brand to perfectly fit the bill (as usual).  These are not too long. perfect for kitchen use.  Their tips are not the annoying soft silicone type like so many out there but instead a harder tip that is angled and pointed so you can use then for a number of surfaces or into pots of boiling things.  I really love the feel of these in my smallish hands and that they lock is an added bonus so they don't take up tons of room in your drawer.  Perfect!"
2,"I bought the 12&#34; size 6 years ago and they are still serving me well. I just bought the 16&#34; & 9&#34; sizes for almost $30 and if they are as good as the older 12&#34; ones. I'm OK with spending that coin. They are easy to clean. do not rust. and the locking mechanism is super nice! Cheap tongs with that cheesy metal slide annoy me to no end as they enviably slide down and lock the tongs when I need to pick something up. Spontaneous locking is not a problem with these."
2,"I have had these for a couple years. and I think I use them almost every day. The locking feature is really handy. and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands. The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy. cool grip.I have one minor complaint. the tongs don't work well with delicate things. For example. with chicken parmesan. the breading rips right off. Now. we'll eat anything. so it isn't a big deal to us. I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods."
3,"This book is a reissue of an old one; the author was born in 1910. It's of the era of. say. Nero Wolfe. The introduction was quite interesting. explaining who the author was and why he's been forgotten; I'd never heard of him.The language is a little dated at times. like calling a gun a &#34;heater.&#34;  I also made good use of my Fire's dictionary to look up words like &#34;deshabille&#34; and &#34;Canarsie.&#34; Still. it was well worth a look-see."
3,"This is a short story focused on Darth Maul's role in helping the Trade Federation gain a mining colony. It's not bad. but it's also nothing exceptional. It's fairly short so we don't really get to see any characters develop. The few events that do happen seem to go by quickly. including what should have been major battles. The story is included in the novelShadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul). which is worth reading. so don't bother to buy this one separately."
3,"I have a version of 'Star by Star' that does not include the novella 'Recovery.' so I downloaded this book onto my Fire.  'Recovery' tells of Leia's recovery after she was nearly killed in 'Balance Point.'  If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia's relationship. it surely failed.  There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation.  They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out. like in the DVD's. where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.  It was worth it. but probably not to everyone."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
3,"The events of 'Ylesia' take place during 'Destiny's Way.'  If you've read 'Destiny's Way.' you will see it mentioned in passing.Jaina and Jacen go to Ylesia to fight the Peace Brigade to show them that it's not good to align themselves with the enemy.  From there. it is page after page of battle scenes.  It is endless.  One huge chapter.  It's like the chapter that was cut out for good reason.'Ylesia' doesn't advance 'Destiny's Way' or 'The New Jedi Order' in any way that I could tell.  We don't learn anything new.  There is no insight.  If I had skipped it. I wouldn't have missed anything.If you don't mind reading in PDF. 'Ylesia' is available free from Del Rey.  If you Google. you'll see it linked to the Wayback machine and it's still there."
3,"For whatever reason. Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The 'Tales of...' are great in that they explain background characters. However.Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work. this is mostly a book of action. not intricate plot development. In fact. the story ends with an exciting twist. but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love. or included a really interesting plot twist. Also. just to note. this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version."
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
3,"The WSJ for Kindle is overpriced. and the customer service has gone completely haywire since the newspaper was bought out.  I have read and subscribed by Kindle. print edition. and iPhone app (WSJ Mobile).  Unfortunately. they are all horrible in contebt delivery--even though the writing is still superb--and try calling them.  10 minute waits to speak to someone in a different country who will put you on hold. and then when you try to cancel. it is abysmal.  More waiting.  I will never be part of WSJ Online. pinrt. Mobile or Kindle after my recent experiences.  Again. the company has been bought out and is now on its way out.  Beware."
3,"This is it. the big kahuna of financial newspapers delivered right to your Kindle. You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this. This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle. It only lets you view the content on the Kindle. No printing articles. no emailing articles to a friend. no using it in presentations. You are stuck. Very evil is it not !So. if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend."
3,"This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered.  There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web.  The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome.  Graphs. photos. and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format.  It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access.  WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible.  Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete. you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies.  I am seriously considering canceling.6/2/2012 Update: I have canceled my subscription."
3,"ten days into my trial subscription and i have decided to cancel. have read the wsj for 30 years and i guess i have one foot in the digital world and one in the analog world.i won't repeat all of the other comments. i can concur on the difficulties of making the transition to kindle reading. if i was still in a job that had me traveling alot it might make sense but since i pick up my wsj of my front porch it just doesn't work.the one thing that really baffles me is how to cancel a free trial. unless the magic button is hiding right out in the open. i can't find a website or kindle method to cancel. i had to call into customer service and yes. it got taken care of but i was disconnected three times before i made it into the queue. the fidelity of the call made it almost impossible to understand what the person was saying. and the english of the rep was spotty at best. not up to the usual amazon quality."
3,"I am a big fan of the NY Times and see it as one of the top newspapers in the U.S.  One: $19.99 for the Kindle download covers every edition for the month.  Okay. say you miss looking at it for a day or two. that is still an excellent price.  You don't have time to read it all. no problem.  The fact is this is an everyday download.  Well worth the price.  Two. and listen up. you also get access to the NY Times on their homepage giving you the articles and the opportunity of email letters sent to your box which outline the major stories of the day. just in case your life has been particularly busy.  Like I said. downloading the NY Times through Amazon is a Double Plus.  Pass this on."

3,"The NY Times in Kindle format is great!  The majority of the paper is there each day and it's easy to navigate and read.  The print portion of articles is good. but the quality of the limited number of pictures or other rare graphics could be better.  Sometimes there's an article missing one day; then it pops up in the next day's issue.  That's acceptable to me because I know at some point the day's edition has to be closed and distributed.  What I really like is not having the annoying distraction of ads.  Considering the excellent content. the cost isn't that bad at ~$0.67/day.12/26/2010 update: After two months I've canceled the subscription.  I would subscribe again if the cost was $10/month but at $20/month it is too expensive for a digital edition of the paper."
3,"With a life of one day it is very difficult to rate a newspaper  - they are read for news and other items and serve an extremely practical purpose.  The New York Times has a good reputation and that stands  and whilst in the USA it is a good daily read with interesting articles. news items etc.  If it wasn't up to standard. it would fade away very quickly so &#34;reviewing it&#34; is a little unnecessary.  Enjoy the paper. read it for leisure and information and be thankful you don't live in a nation without such information readily available and virtually free."
3,"I admit I am biased. as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance. entertainment. style. and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate. filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion. I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture. or something).  The online editions can be hard to read. and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have. but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork. the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers). easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition. in a great reading format.Well done!"
3,"Why is it that these great newspapers cannot figure out the digital format?  The kindle versions frequently are stripped down versions without photos and charts and in many cases without some of the sections.  Do they really think that people want to pay for that.  There are too many free news sources that can accomplish this level of news.  If they really want to get subscribers to pay. they need to provide a newspaper experience (some people even like the ads!!)  The new Kindle version of the New York Times is an example of an improved newspaper experience where the kindle version has even more pictures than the paper in some cases (this is what digital can excel at).  The times still has its weaknesses but its an improvement.  The Post is still not worth buying digitally."
3,"It's nice to see an author go back and visit the New Jedi Order era. This time. Karen Traviss combines fan favorite Boba Fett and NJO favorite Nom Anor to show the Mandalorians' role in the Yuuzhan Vong war. Traviss does a pretty good job fitting both into their characters. Boba Fett is appropriately cynical. but at the same time also concerned about the Mandalorians. Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation. We also get to see Nom Anor's private thoughts and a bit more insight into his time as infiltrator.Even for a short story. it seemed a bit too short and ends rather abruptly. I would have liked to have seen  bit more. or at least learn what the Mandalorians did after the first few weeks of the invasion. It's tough to be satisfied with this after reading Unifying Force. where Han sees Boba Fett fighting alongside Alliance troops. Hopefully that story will be written one day."
3,"I have read several Shannon Stacey books and the Devlin Group series is by far my favorites!  This book is the 1ST of the 3 book series (in order:  72 hours. On the Edge. No Surrender).  I never read books twice. but I will definitely be revisiting this series and I saw on the authors website that a 4th one is in the works!  I can't say enough about this series and can definitely not pick a favorite!  I have read some other reviews on this 1st book and can't say I agree with the 3 and 4 star ratings. but for those of you who would be willing to read more. finish the series before you write a complete review."
3,"Alex Rossi aka Sean Devlin is leading a double life--he's the founder of Devlin Group as Sean Devlin; and he's Alex Rossi (his real name). one of Devlin Groups senior agents. His lifetime goal has been to find & kill the man who murdered his mother.Grace Nolan is an ex- agent. and considers Sean Devlin a friend. When her young son. Danny. is kidnapped. she's forced to ask Devlin Group to help her find & rescue him. The kidnapper just happens to be the killer Alex is seeking. and the killer knows the secret connection between Grace & Alex---Danny is Alex's son---although Alex just found that out. He's furious Grace never told him about Danny. She was furious Alex shot her just before she found out she was pregnant!!This romantic suspense book has plenty of action scenes; tense moments; great one-liners; and great secondary characters who more than likely will have their own stories; I.e.. Gallagher & Carmen."
3,"This was a mildly interesting. slightly humorous. day-to-day chronicle of a very boring guy's life. I found the historical insights engaging. and some of the daily activities of people in those days interesting. I wish that there had been a little more about the wider events that were happening beyond just the writer's activities. But. then. that would not have been in concert with the title of the book. The author certainly believed in truth in advertising. The title of the book says it all. It's a quick read and never complex."
3,"This is Twain's satire of contemporary religious mores. It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime. and like much of his later work. it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic. although more upbeat than. for example. _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall. but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can. or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views. more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout. but no more than that. and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read. at 630 kindle 'locations'."
3,"Great book.  I always like fairy tales.  For some. the tales are a bit morbid and not suitable for children of today.  Guess I am not sure what I have been told that.  I guess the reason is that TV is the primary culture-resources input allowed by parents and society to pickle the minds of today's children since there is no requirement for an education that would allow them to read?I recommend Grimm because the stories allow those that can read the opportunity to exercise their mind in the &#34;original&#34; virtual space (imagination).Get it!  It's free!"
3,"This is a greatest-hits grab bag of 25 stories from the Grimm's Fairy Tales collection. unillustrated. and apparently taken from the 1884 Margaret Hunt translation.

3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
3,"I would highly recommend this classic to everyone from young teens to our most senior adults.  Warning it is a long. involved tale that can't be read in one evening.  Since every character is a man. it is a less than sentimental journey.  Though they are definitely some tearful scenes.  One character is a former slave. but is treated as the others' equal though somewhat condescendedly.  I enjoyed looking back at a culture and customs that are long gone.  And no spoilers. but you may want to read another Verne classic when done with this one..."
3,"I finally read this book last month and enjoyed every chapter. It shows how they managed to survive on the island by making tools and items in their cave. This book is by far one of the best 'stranded on an island' books you could hope for. It is probably one of Jules Verne's best. The inhabitants of an island are banded together and when they get into a tight spot. there is a mysterious force that always helps out. This force is not revealed until nearly the end. I highly recommend it to everyone."
3,"Read this book years ago and enjoyed it then. however. I enjoyed it even more reading it on my Kindle. What has inspired me about this book is the people in the book on the island are very different. yet come together to work together and survive. Yes. I know that there are lots of reviews on this book. however. what I want to say to you is that if you are looking for a book that will inspire you that you can survive anything. then read this book.And if read in a low time in your life. it will be meaningful to you to see the right answer. This is what I found that this book did for me. it helped me see what is important and what is not."
3,"Every child should read 20.000 leagues under the sea. a classic adventure.  Following that with just a little prompting they should be intrigues to read this sequel of what happened to Captain Nemo and the Nautilus.  There are a classic few books that in my viewpoint children should be exposed to Tom Sawyer (and its sequel Huckleberry Finn). Last of the Mohicans. Animal Farm.  The Hobbit. Tarzan. Harry Potter. A Yankee in King Arthurs Court...This book is not as good as 20.000 Leagues but if their interest has been peaked tehy may stll wade through this novel and reading these classics is by far a better activity for children than video games."
3,"I came into the book expecting it to be great. and I was surprised that it exceeded even my own inflated expectations. I've read many of Jules Verne's works. and I can sat that I was thoroughly amused the whole time I was reading this book. I've come to the realization that very few writers today even come close to the marvelous works that were wrought by hands such as Jules Verne. Would I recommend it? YES! If you enjoy a little bit of Sci-Fi. a lot of adventure. some laughs. and some good time well spent you'll love reading Jules Verne's &#34;The Mysterious Island&#34;."
3,"This is one of the classic stories of Jules Verne and it is also one of my favorites.  Five prisoners of war escape using a balloon.  Caught in a massive storm they are carried thousands of miles and land on a remote island with no inhabitants.  They begin to build what life they can and they are very creative and ingenious. Their adventures are what make this story so entertaining.  As the true nature of the island is discovered the group is faced with both threats from enemies and help from a mysterious benefactor.Jules Verne's writing and perceptions of the future and Sci-Fi were well ahead of his time.  This is an excellent story and I recommend it to you."
3,"Jules Verne has a knack for detail.  This book has a good plot and a mystery not solved until the end.  This keeps one reading even though it is a very tedious chore.  Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR"
3,"I had never read any of the old Classics so I picked up this book after reading so many good reviews.  It did start a little slow. but at the same time intriguing with the mystery of where the bullet came from.  At times I could not put it down.  I enjoyed all of the characters. and found it very interesting how they created things we take for granted today.  It's hard to remember that people used to have to do everything for themselves. it sure has been a lost art in the western society! I found the writing wonderful and Jules Verne painted wonderful details which made the story itself such a pleasure to read!"
3,"This is the best book I have ever read in my life.  I am 60 years old and read about 100 books a year.  This is a story about a group of men who really care about each other and risk their lives to help each other.  There is plenty of action and adventure to keep your interest. but the true story is this group of men.  I keep it on my Kindle. and when I have nothing else to read. I open the book and re-read it.  I wish modern novels where of this quality.  I enjoy all of his books. but this is his best.  I recommend it to everyone. and it is free. how can it get any better."
3,"When I was growing up. I was not exposed to the literary world.  I purchased this kindle book and am so glad I did.It was. at times. repetitive (I wanted to say. 'OK. you told us that already - a few times&#34;.)  At times. it was idealistic and at other times it was realistic.  The detail of how they made the island their own is educational.I definitely got caught up in it.  I would recommend this book to middle school students & pre-teens with imagination.The language requires attention but is worth the effort."
3,"I liked the creative ideas. the making and building of items.  The whole story was great...except for the killing of so many animals.  the book was written at a different time in the history of the world. the language is interesting to read and understand.  To distroy so much when now we need to save out plantet hurts  to read and think about.The book is worth the reading...as is all of this authors books.Naturally we would perfer he not kill the leading mystery man and the many life forms.The writer was a genuis."
3,"In his day A. Hyatt Verrill was mostly known for his adventure and fantasy stories. Today Verrill is mostly remembered for this little book on knots.Knots are one of mankind's oldest inventions and over the millennia we have evolved thousands of them. Knots are used by everyone from sailors to brain surgeons to join and hold things together. In this book Verrill gathers a few hundred of the most useful knots. shows how to tie them and gives a little bit on their background and uses.The instructions and the accompanying illustrations are clear and at least for the simpler knots makes tying them easy. A wonderful book for everyone from Scouts to sailors to armchair browsing."
3,"I picked this book up because it was free.and I wanted it for reference material. I already know how to tie a large portion of the knots in this book. My biggest problem with this book is that a lot of the pictures didn't load or wouldn't load. Since you can read how to tie a knot it is not to terrible a problem if you know how to tie knots. But someone who doesn't or is a beginner will have problems. All in all it is a good book and is very informative."
3,"I was not disappointed. sometimes sad. sometimes happy but always keeping you turning the pages. I most definitely would read more of this author.You need to realize that it is set in times past. but that only sets the stage for how grateful we should be to live in the here and now.wonderful tale. a keeper.The English OrphansI went to kindle store and downloaded several more of her books and can't wait to start on them. (I went for the freebies so don't know how the 3.00 plus books would be.) formating.english etc. may be better."
3,"OK. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I saw this 'free' book written in the 1800s.  I wouldn't exactly characterize myself as a learned reader of literary classics.  I had just received my Kindle and figured. what have I got to loose?I was absolutely pulled in by this story and had problems putting it down.  It's a captivating mystical love story about an Egyptian princess.  This was the first Haggard book that I've ever read and I will definitely download his more famous literary works to read in the future."
3,"Interesting book about the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan in the 1800s etc. The Indian author Andrew Blackbird wanted to get an education. and was a hard worker. but the money that was sent by the US Government. was not really available to him. as the system. including agents and friends disposed of it first. Another documented case where the system of Indian Agents really did not work well for the Indians. but rather was used by the agents for their benefit. Typical where the system is captured by the persons operating the system. and not by the people the system was set up to serve. He did an excellent job of collecting historical information. and creating a english to the local indian tongue dictionary. A little gem of a book."
3,"This was a book of many wonderful Indian fairy tales. It includes tales both of a 'classical' fairy tale style and ones that are moralistic folktales instead.  All are wonderful.Stories included are:The Lion and the CraneHow the Raja's Son Won the Princess LabamThe LambikinPunchkinThe Broken PotThe Magic FiddleThe Cruel Crane OutwittedLoving LailiThe Tiger. the Brahman and the JackelThe Soothsayer's SonHarisamanThe Charmed RingThe Talkative TortoiseA Lac of Rupees for a Bit of AdviceThe Gold-Giving SerpentThe Son of Seven QueensA Lesson for KingsPride Goeth Before a FallRaja RasaluThe Ass in the Lion's SkinThe Farmer and the Money LenderThe Boy Who had a Moon on his Forehead...The Prince and the FakirWhy the Fish LaughedThe Demon with the Matted HairThe Ivory City and its Fairy PrincessHow Sun. Moon and Wind Went Out to DinnerHow the Wicked Sons were DupedThe Pigeon and the CrowFor more Indian tales you can also check outDeccan Nursery Tales or. Fairy Tales from the SouthorHindu Tales from the Sanskrit. although they are both aimed slightly more towards an audience of children."
3,"Of course I generally knew this story but I had actually never read Charles Dickens before.  I guess it was time and I looked forward to reading this classic.  I sure was disappointed because I hadn't realized how depressing it was.  Dickens' England was not a kind and gentle place.  It was cold and ugly and many people were very cruel.  The story was sad and my heart went out to the poor orphan Oliver.  But he was not the only one who lived a sad life.  All the characters were caught up in a web of unpleasantness and cruelty was everywhere.O.K.  Dickens is a fine writer and I understand how his works have met the test of time.  But life is just too short for me to try to read any Dickens again."
3,"I wasn't sure to expect when I ordered this book. I've heard great reviews. but sometimes when I get around to reading the book. it just doesn't live up to the hype. Not so in this case.I sincerely enjoyed this tale of the young. innocent Oliver Twist and his story of misfortune. While the novel was darker and more violent than I'd at first anticipated. the language flows like poetry. I loved the roller coaster ride Dickens takes us on as Oliver searches to escape the evils forced upon him. only to be pulled back in. The build to the climax of the story was expertly formulated and executed.Oliver Twist is a classic in the true sense of the word. If you've not had the pleasure of reading this novel. don't delay. Order it today."
3,"A very good collection of folk tales from Britain.  The author tried hard to make sure that the stories were commonly from Britain though they may have spread elsewhere or a variation came from elsewhere.  Some very English folk tales?  Henny Penny. Jack and the Beanstalk.  there are many Jack tales. and The Three Bears.  Most have humourous endings and seem to be stories to amuse everyone.  Jacobs.  the author said he used fairy tales in the title because no kid ever asks for a folk tale."
3,"These stories were written in a rough tone and have an unpolished feel to them. This is not necessarily a detraction. and some tales were better than other. but it was occasionally wearying to read them in the poor grammar of colloquial speech. Hence. four stars. Also. it lacks an interactive table of contents.Tales included are;Tom Tit TotThe Three SilliesThe Rose-TreeThe Old Woman and Her PigHow Jack Went to Seek His FortuneMr. VinegarNix Nought NothingJack HannafordBinnorieMouse and MouserCap o'RushesTeeny-TinyJack and the BeanstalkThe Story of the Three Little PigsThe Master and His PupilTitty Mouse and Tatty MouseJack and his Golden Snuff-BoxThe Story of the Three BearsJack the Giant-KillerHenny-PennyChilde RowlandMolly WhuppieThe Red EttinThe Golden ArmTHe History of Tom ThumbMr. FoxLazy JackJohnny-CakeEarl Mar's DaughterMr. MiaccaWhittington and his CatThe Strange VisitorThe Laidly Worm of Spindleston HeughThe Cat and the MouseThe Fish and the RingThe Magpie's NestKate CrackernutsThe Cauld Lad of HiltonThe Ass. the Table and the StickFairy OintmentThe Well of the World's EndMaster of All MastersThe Three Heads of the Well"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"I really can't say I loved it. It was good in parts and than slow and boring in others.  My biggest problem with the book I think has to do with the heroine. Yes. he abandoned her and so on but after he explains his reasons which were understandable you would think that the wife at some point would understand too. but nope.It takes 245 pages for this 2 to actually get together. After they finally get to lie together something else comes up and we have to read another 100 more pages for this women to forgive him again. The story and the idea is not bad the last 40 pages were quit good and romantic but before I reached those I actually struggled to continue reading."
3,"Mallory Edwards married John Barron when she was sixteen. Neither wanted to marry but were forced into the marriage for security for Mallory and by his father on John's part. John leaves Mallory. without consummating the marriage. on their wedding night. Fast forward seven years. their paths cross again when she shows up at a soiree of his latest mistress. John is no longer a young man. pushed around by his father and Mallory is no longer his teenage bride. They literally run away from the soiree due to John's crooked uncle Louis embezzling John's funds and leaving him broke and to a mob of people to whom he owes money. Mallory has lost her home due to not receiving help from her absent husband and she wants a divorce so she can marry an old friend. During their running and hiding. John decides that he will not give Mallory her divorce. but instead lays siege to win her back. Mallory is a tough woman though and she puts John through misery in more than one way."
3,"This book was my least favorite of the series. It was lacking detail in the beginning and the heroine's purpose seemed too manufactured to me. I also couldn't get my head wrapped around the alternating first and third person accounts chapter to chapter. The static characters were a little too static for me (there could have been a little more explanation for some of the behaviors or snootier snubs. And none of them ever really seemed to be resolved).The ending seemed a little scraped together as well. Having already read others in the series. I know this is just a fluke. I will say I liked the characters though. in better development of their back stories or resolutions I would have been more apt to give four stars. Still. it was a decent read. But not one I would be in a hurry to re-read."
3,"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise. this will be the one I end up subscribing to. If you are a Longhorn nut like myself. I'd like to suggest the 'Burnt Orange Nation' blog for your Kindle. It has numerous daily blogs which many are lengthy - sent daily (sometimes several times a day) to your Kindle and keeps you right on top of the Longhorn happenings."
3,"I was going to give four stars. but this newspaper and the subscription experience really couldn't be any better.  My expectations were low based on old reviews. but it looks like everything is worked out now.  There are sufficient graphics. plenty of good content. with the bylines you'd expect.  Okay. cartoons. comics. and crosswords would be nice. but I can forgive the omission.  In fairness. I've only been reading the paper for a few days. so maybe there will be delivery problems in my future.  If so. I'll update this review.  But so far so good.  I'm considering a move to Austin. and I expect to learn a lot about the area by reading the local paper.  This is a really good small newspaper."
3,"As I say in the title. I'm new to Analog having subscribed to it only by Kindle. I'm loving it. I had no idea the Kindle version was more expensive than the print version. While I find this curious. I don't have a preexisting view of a fair price for this magazine. As such. I think the $2.99 per month with instant delivery to a much more pleasant reading format (Kindly versus paper). I'm pretty happy.My delight in Analog is a credit both to the magazine and to the Kindle. I'm thoroughly loving this."
3,"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison. TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month. and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre."
3,"I read both Ellery Queen and Alfred Hitchcock magazines. and I greatly prefer the former.  Consistently strong entries from Clark Howard. Doug Allyn. and other short story powerhouses really make this magazine a pleasure.  I travel for business. and short stories are a perfect entertainment - well-written enough to really hold my interest. but short enough to complete during the shorter periods of time I have available for reading.  And. I particularly love that this publication is now available for the Kindle.  Fantastic."
3,"This magazine  gave me my 1st introduction to this genre of story.  I figured it was better to read a magazine dedicated to mysteries and suspense to get my 1st taste than to spend eight or ten dollars on a book that I may or may not end up liking.  I was not disappointed.  The stories I read were 1st rate and moved along at good pace rather than some books I've read that get so bogged down in details that it seems like it takes forever for the author to finally get around to revealing the plot of the story.  If you like mystery and suspense fiction then I would recommend this magazine.  If you're like I was and a stranger to the genre and just want to get your feet wet to see whether or not it's your cup-o-tea then I also recommend this magazine."
3,"I have become a big fan of this e-magazine. along with the Hitchcock. Asimov and Analog mags. You can't ask for better escapism on your Kindle. My long que of books to read are gathering dust due to my new fondness for short fiction stories. Can't go wrong for the price if you enjoy reading. My only gripe is not being able to view the cover in color on my Kindle. Guess I'll need to buy the new Kindle Fire for that. If you like mysteries. detective stories. etc.. you'll enjoy EQMM. If nothing else. try the 14 day free trial and find out for yourself."
3,"When I used to go to Europe I would seek out a copy of the International Herald Tribune every morning. and usually read it from cover to cover. It simply was a superior newspaper. covering not only USA news but world news. business. sports. etc. Coming back home I would actually feel a sense of loss at having to read our local paper.So I was thrilled when the Kindle edition of the International Herald Tribune came out and I immediately subscribed. The IHT is as good as ever. Excellent. well written articles. In-depth analysis of world events. It's all there. My advice: try the trial subscription for two weeks; I bet you end up cancelling the Times. etc.. and go with the International Herald Tribune."
3,"I have read most of this author's books. I simply love. love. love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each. in their own right. riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly. there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed. no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again. I love. love. love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too."
3,"I love this series. The Westmoreland' s are a beautiful family. Each Westmoreland story is romantic. selfless. family oriented. and so full of love. I love Brenda Jackson's love stories. ( if you can call them that. because to me they are equally about family bonds)but. she does get a little repetitive with wording her love making scenes. I would still give her 5 stars on the story writing because I do love her take on romance. however. the editing of this five book set was awful. Need to use a better editor."
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
3,"I LOVE BELLE ANDRE!!!!  Let me start by saying that I truly truly enjoy reading Belle Andre books.  Yet this one fell short.  Usually I can sit down with my pot of coffee on a Saturday and Sunday morning soaking up the romance that drips from the pages and by Sunday evening. I'm sorry that I read it so fast and want more. The story just didn't make sense to me.  I had a really hard to time getting into the characters.  It was steamy but usually Belle Andre has me with the love story and the steam is the bonus.  This one not so much."
3,"I love Bella Andre and cannot wait for more of the Sullivan's...she promised that this summer she would continue with the series....I have read them all twice and will read them all again....The Sullivan men are so handsome and such regal gentlemen....a woman loves to believe that there is really a man out there that is just like them...Rich and yet honorable and so sexy and so understanding...they actually can feel what they're loved one is going through and doesn't make her wrong and always strives to make it right and wonderul...of course the &#34;sex&#34; scenes are amazing and yet so believable....Ms. Andre. I am waiting for more of your wonderful and talented imagination to be put in print..."
3,"I started these in the order they were written. not that it matters. just my choice.  Each one was better than the one before.  I don't like to divulge too much info as it spoils the read sometimes.  The brief descriptions give me enough to go on as to whether I want to read a book or not.  These were really page turners and just when you thought you knew. you were wrong...or were you.  I really enjoyed these and look forward to more."
3,"Just finished reading all of Kava's books; they were very good!  I am not a book critic; but what I can say is the entire lot of her books were entertaining and held my interest.  Anytime I pick up a book and read instead of doing something else in my free time is saying something!  Kava. Garnder. Gerritssen. Gagnon what a list of great reads for anyone that enjoys these types of stories....And the bundle provieds the ability to acquire six of her books for a good price!"
3,"And I don't know how many more times I will read it. One thing is for certain this author could write the phone book and it would be a runaway best seller. I started reading the McKettricks sagas starting in the 1800 with Angus McKettrich and have loved them all. The writing is excellent the characters are described with a depth few authors are able to describe characters  with. For some reason in this three part series starting with Rance in 'McKettrick's Pride'. Jesse in 'McKettrick's luck and finally Keegan in 'McKettrick's Heart'' Keegan's character grips your heart. his pain becomes your pain and when joy finally finds him it becomes your joy. I have enjoyed getting to know them all but for some reason Keegan has stayed in my heart."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
3,"I've always like the Reader's Digest for a good blend of writing from humor to drama. having subscribed to the print version a number of times off and on over the years.  The actual content quality has always remained consistently high for this publication.It does seem the print version has become overloaded with ads. but that was less of a problem than the annoying cardboard insert/tear-out ads that make the thing physically difficult to read.The Kindle version is a very much improved experience over the print version. with the same high quality writing. of course.  A bonus is that the linked navigation makes it really easy to find an article for the mood I'm in at a given moment."
3,"I am a new Kindle user and downloaded my first issue of Reader's digest and was simply delighted with it!  I read it from cover to cover over a few days time which I have never done in the hard copy of the magazine.  I love that there are no ads and found it easy to navigate between the articles and features.  Thanks Kindle and Reader's digest!Its a few months later and I am updating that I still LOVE this magazine in Kindle format. I have seen a few people complain about not getting their back issues but I have no trouble at all with it. I had been off for a few weeks and when I returned I went to my Manage my Kindle on Amazon and there was a down arrow where I could select which issue I wanted to download so I selected both I had not read and voila! Both are on my Kindle now for me to read.  No problems at all.  Enjoy the magazine!"
3,"The New York Times-Latest News is a great buy. It gets updated during the day and you can virtually have a morning and an evening edition of the news. It is.obviously.an abbreviated version of the newspaper and does not include any of the other sections of the newspaper (like Science Times.Arts and Leisure etc;). It does however have detailed analysis and reporting of the day's main headlines. The table of contents runs 5-6 pages and each news article runs 3-4 pages on the Kindle making it a quick but satisfying read.If you don't have the time or inclination to read an entire newspaper then The New York Times-Latest News is for you-- and at a sweet price of $1.99 a month it is one of those deals where you get MORE than what you pay for !"
3,"This is the first book in the Heroes of Silver Springs. I totally loved this book. I couldn't put it down once I started it. I loved how these two people came back together after years of being apart. I must admit it made me think of the guy I was crushing on when I was in High School wondering what he thought of me. LOL. I loved how Veronica has become her own woman and has decided to do what she wants and feels like doing instead of what others expect of her and want her to do. I loved how she was able to knock Dean off balance from the beginning. I really enjoyed watching these two people learn about each other and fall in love. I think that this is going to be a great series to read because I know that if the rest of the series is as good as this one then we are in for a treat!"
3,"This is first story in the series Robert St.Clare is given a gift of a slave girl for the two weeks he will be visiting there.When she is brought to him the first night he finds she is an English girl and he knows her father. They have sex and more sex every night while they are being watched through peep holes. He wants to take her home with him but it is hard to talk and make plans with everyone listening. They do get to leave together you are not sure at first if it will happen. They have a brief seperation but the HEA does happen. Each story will be the man telling how he met his wife.A very enjoyable series. If you are some one who likes a like of sex in your stories you will certainly find it here."
3,"Ok. I know it's free and shouldn't complain... but sometimes I just can't help myself. Does that make me a bad person? No. just an honest one.  At first It was ok....not bad. but then I signed up for some REAL blogs and discovered that yes...BAD. and getting worse! It's a waste of my time to read about a cooking utensil for something I will never cook or a designer's clothes I will never be able to afford.  There are occasionally some info on books. but I can certainly find that on my own.  Seriously. kitchen utensils. what the celebrities wore at a concert and Korean cooking(which is quite frequently blogged about) are not things that I will miss after canceling my &#34;subscription&#34;.  But hey. That's just me!DawnBee &#60;3(you get what you pay for)"
3,"Can't imagine any Kindle owner not signing on for this freebie info source.  You get light. fast news items. quickie feature pieces. meaty author interviews. and goofy pictures of lava lamps and trendy adult beverages.  Fun stuff all.  Even the rhapsodic essays about failed. discontinued automobiles like the Gremlin and the Pacer (inexplicably. a regular feature) are growing on me.Even if you bought your Kindle just to read e-books and not get news and features (not me... I like everything the Kindle offers). sign up for this free blog generously offered by the Amazon powers-that-be.  At the very least. you'll enjoy the many book suggestions 'Amazon Daily' will send your way.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation and functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals. so as this review gets older. it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product."
3,"One cent per month? Ok. I bit.I'm glad I did. Updated several times a day (whenever they feel like blogging) on a wide variety of subjects. The other day an article was about an early 1970s car. and how it influenced later models. etc. We had thoughts on the Grammy Awards. recipes. new devices. book reviews. on and on.Previously. I would turn the Whispernet (or whatever it is called) off in the morning after receiving my newspapers. Now. I tend to leave it on all day so I can enjoy (or skip. as the case may be) any new Amazon blog.Why not five stars? Due to the presence. in many articles. of links for you to click: IF you were on a computer. Since the Kindle will not follow those links. they are a bit intrusive at times.UPDATE: Now its free? Heck. why not."
3,"This is the third time in a month that my Amazon Daily hasn't been delivered to my Kindle. I haven't had an update since July 23. but I've received new material in the form of a new book I ordered and two samples today. Yes. of course I had turned my Kindle net connection on.What's up? I know the blog has been updated on the website.This kind of thing makes me reluctant to subscribe to other Kindle blogs. ones that aren't free. This was an experiment and so far. I'm discouraged.update: The blog is started with a free trial. and at the end of the free trial. updates stop. Since it is a free blog. one would think that it would just continue to be delivered. or at least that there would be a notice to sign up for future copies. But no. However. I tried an experiment and signed up again for the blog and it's delivered every day [almost] now."
3,"Whoever wrote the synopsis of the story did not read it.  She wasn't trying to drive him away with sweetness.  She really was sweet.  Though apparently not to sweet to casually give away her virginity.  But give her credit she is smart enough not to mention it to him and get away with it.  No real point to telling him.  I know some readers felt that she should have remained a virgin because of the time period.  But unfortunately girls have been talked out of it by the wrong guy throughout history.  Nothing new on that front.  Anyway still a pretty good story."
3,"Thank God this was free because it was so terrible. 1. Heroine meets hero 10 seconds later they are declaring they have feelings for each other and they have sex (she of course a virgin) 2. They then decide to go back to his Dragon lair after the heroines mother who is perfectly ok with it because what mother wouldn't be perfectly okay with it? 3. Then when they get to the lair there is this weird rule where she has to marry two men and that man falls in love the next day with her (mom is okay with this too bc mama Dragon told her it was the way things were)and they have some boring m/f/m sex..this is all intertwined with the dragons of course and that is also rather boring. All in all hated it."
3,"This book actually had a pretty interesting and not so common storyline regarding the dragon/knight subject matter. I was very excited to see some spicy love story mixed into this interesting world created by the author and was even happier when she threw in the man&egrave;ge as part of the love story... This is also actually where she lost me :-/. Unfortunately Lars was introduced and then quickly incorporated into the relationship without much of a separate set up and that bothered me. I think I would have liked equal time between the two husbands and the emotional havoc it caused for this to be a higher rated book."
3,"Within minutes of meeting each other the two main characters are having sex. graphically.  And then it gets worse from there.The plot could have been good if it wasn't turned into a porno.  A naive young woman meets a dashing knight who rides a dragon.  The woman has the unique ability to speak to dragons and joins the companions at their new base of operations.The main characters happen to be married within weeks of meeting after numerous sexual encounters between her new husband. his dragon and her other new husband.  The narration then documents the continual mating of the dragons and the humans over and over and over again.This book is not appropriate for teens and I would recommend any squeamish adults stay away from it as well."
3,"I've enjoyed several of Ms. D'arc's other books so decided to try this series.  I'm definitely enjoying it!The idea of having the dragons mating tied to the knights finding a mate is a great idea. The world building is great. including the idea of a dragon society where humans and dragons work together to successfully and peacefully exist is wonderful!I did think the meet and have sex aspect was a little too rushed but. since this is: a short read; a different society and the author explained the love at first sight thing - it's okay.I liked the action and was eagerly rushing to read the next book - Border Lair.  I do not like the fact that some of the sub-story books have not been published yet but I guess I have to be patient."
3,"Wow dragons!! Knights!! and Mistress' oh my. smiles I loved it!! A great blend of characters and story line. I just had fun reading this. A bit sassy girl meets a dragon and a Knight and in one day is swept off her feet. I loved the action it was fast paced. The sex was hot. the element that the pleasure of the riders and the best are intertwined. Wait did I mention the sex scenes were hot!! smiles again. A awesome tale that made you want to continue to read and a wee bit sad when you were done. Garath and Lars played the story of mellowing bel very well. Makes one think who played who. Did I mention dragon sex?? along with magic. The Mama dragon is soo endearing you cant help but love her. Its a good thing she has more books in this series. Enjoy"
3,"This is the first book in a series that has 5 books so far.  That's not obvious when trying to purchase on Amazon but if you go to the author's website first you can figure it out.  I read this book 3rd (read book 5 then 3 because she changes the series names for no reason).  Even though I know what was going to happen I enjoyed the story.  I did find it a bit abrupt.  With it being book one more explanation could have been done.  If I hadn't read the other books first I wouldn't have understood the customs. and the reasons for them.  With this being book one. the foundations for the story could have been better done."
3,"I bought this on a lark one day not expecting much but oh how wrong I was - I bought every other book that was available that day and while anxiously awaiting any new ones to be released have re-read them all again. I write this in response to a post on the authors blog that she wrote showing the horrible reviews this book got.. Well I felt that I had to let her know that I am one very happy customer and once I bought this series I went on to purchase all of the Brotherhood of the Blood (Vampire Tales) books along with the Tales of the Ware.. which I also love. I rarely write reviews. but I just have to ask what book or books those other people were reading because it sure wasn't this one. Happy writing Ms. D Arc I already have the next two books in the Dragon Knight series on pre-order and keep checking your website for updates on when the next Tales of the Ware are coming out -Thank you !"
3,"All my preferred stories have a nice. moderately robust plot.  This book by D'Arc promised paranormal/fantasy as well as erotica.  There is some romance. but there is a great del of lust and frequent close encounters.  The action starts very early in the book. and I was slightly disappointed when I felt that more of a lead-in would have tied the story together neatly.  Stick with it.  The storyline is new. and the inception is interesting.  If you can appreciate the emotions and actions often connected with erotica. you will enjoy this new offering.  M&eacute;nage of the male/female/male variety is present as well as more traditional one-on-one. and the author even includes the non-human characters."
3,"My first introduction to this author was her Brotherhood of the Blood novels which are absolutely remarkable.  I think the things that turned off other readers was that the type of erotica in this book was unexpected.  Threesomes are more often in her writing than a monogamist relationship.  You have to have an open mind to truly get everything you can from her work.  I think with this novel you also need a healthy dose of imagination.  Don't read any of her work if you don't have open mind and definitely don't read this book if you don't have an imagination.  I. for one. haven't met a book of hers that I didn't like....this is no exception."
3,"I enjoyed the book and the characters I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because I too feel that the author could have backed off a little with all the erotica. The story line is a good one but needs to be developed more. Some reviews were complaining about the link between rider. dragon and sex. If anyone who has read the' Dragonriders of Pern' series would know this has already been established in Dragon fantasy lore. However where as the Pern series down plays the sexual side of the relationships Maiden Flight is in your face erotica. I do agree there needs to be a warning that this is an ADULT dragon fantasy novel  and not for young adults.  The series has great promise and I'm hoping that the next book goes more into the story line with a little sex thrown it ;)"
3,"Plot:When Jake collapsed on her doorstep. Sera knew she finally had to confront their past. What she didn't expect was a night of hot healing loving would fix it all.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (psychic) erotic romance.- 1166 kindle locations. 15000 words (but finishes around 1020 locations).- m/f - explicit. sufficiently frequent. loving.- Includes an excerpt from 'Believe the Magic' by Melani Blazer.Opinion:A nice novella with a strong story and plenty of sweet lovin'. Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
3,"This was a short super quick read. I didn't find it as bad as some of the reviewers here have stated. I think it was fine for what it was. I agree had the story been longer there may have been more interesting and enticing scenes. I would have liked to learn a little more about Sera and her gifts.The entire time I was reading it I kept thinking back to Linda Howards White Out which can be found in Strangers in the Night. The premise seemed similar. Being snowed in but Howards was more of a story. I really enjoyed that one. There was at least one similar scene that while both were good this fell a little short.All in all I liked it. Could there have been more? Of course. but they can't all be novels."
3,"I was disappointed with this story. In and of itself. it was ok if all you want to read about is one weekend of sex between 2 and 3 people. but the story part was lacking. Just as things get to a point where the story could be further developed. it ends. The whole thing could have been longer and more fleshed out. It took me maybe 45 minutes to read this book. For the price. it wasn't worth it.Wade is just kinda thrown in so that there is a 3rd person for the Menage part. and it's hardly believable. He's in love with another woman but it's ok to have sex with someone you don't know?"
3,"Reviewed by Donna B. at You Gotta Read Reviews - A sweet taste of the forbidden. both arousing and potent. ensnares Angie as her boss entices her to spend Christmas at his house. in his bed.  As she falls for his overwhelming charms. they are both surprised by the early arrival of his holiday houseguest.  Ryan has always shared with his best friend. Wade. but as Wade sets his sights on Angie. Ryan begins to realize that sometimes. it's better to act like Scrooge.Mackenzie McKade has spun an explicitly erotic tale of wicked. wanton acts and turned it into a heartwarming romance.  Her descriptions are vivid and clear. her characters have chemistry in spades. and the tale is sexy as sin in Bound for the Holidays."
3,"If you are looking for some heat this holiday season then this short story will warm you up. What could be the worst thing to do at the company Christmas party? Go home with the boss. But heck. Angela knows she's good and she can find another job and Ryan is utterly delicious. But when she agreed to go home with him she wasn't expecting that he'd have his best friend there.Of course Ryan didn't expect it either. Wade is ruggedly handsome. a cowboy. Ryan is sophisticated model good looking. I mean... what more can a girl ask for Christmas? I'd say she was a good girl this year!Ryan has never had a problem sharing women with Wade in the past but something about Angie wakes every possessive instinctive.This story is short and it is an erotica story so there's a lot of sex and not a lot of the actual storyline so if you're looking for something hot then this will be for you.Toe Curling Rating: 4"
3,"This book was below average. There was no build up to Angie and Ryan. He says 'come home with me' and she agrees. When Wade was added it seemed too easy. Angie didn't question him or ask about him just jumped right in. I disliked Wade because if he got his heart broke why was he jumping into a threesome. Ryan couldn't voice his jealousy about Wade with Angie. Angie blindly went along with everything and didn't show a mind of her own. The sex scenes were good and the only reason I gave it three stars. The end felt like the author  gave up on her characters. It ended just as quick as it all began. There was no plot only sex which doesn't normally bother me but this was so unreal. It felt fake from beginning to end."
3,"Angie was expecting to spend a lonely Christmas all by herself until she shares some unexpected time with sexy boss Ryan Tyler at the Christmas party.  When he asks her to come home with him. she jumps at the chance.  It isn't until he is ready to leave the party that Ryan remembers he really is having company - his pal Wade.  They have shared many women in the past. maybe they will share Angie too.When Angie and Ryan arrive at his house. they can't keep their hands off each other.  A knock at the door interrupts them. and Wade is suddenly on the scene.  For the first time in his life. Ryan has to face unfamiliar feelings. and the fact that he doesn't want to share Angie.This is a very erotic sexy story.  The chemistry between Angie and Ryan is to die for."
3,"As a stand-along book. I really enjoyed The Twelve Lies of Christmas. although it didn't have as much of a holiday theme as the title would indicate.The main characters were engaging. if a bit under-developed and the story was fast-paced and kept my interest throughout the story. The one issue I had with the story is that since it's a prequel to the Sophie Green series. I'd expect to read something in the story to interest me in the series. I really didn't. Sophie was a minor footnote at the end. On the other hand. I would be very interested in reading more about Nate & Samantha. I can't imagine that their lives would become less exciting that they started in this book."
3,"I was expecting a whole lot more from this author as I have enjoyed her previous books.  This book was just too short and the characters were not developed enough.  Also I was expecting a christmas theme and the only part of christmas was that none of the characters celebrate christmas and so christmas day is just another day to them.  Hard to swallow that a con artist and a spy could immediately trust and fall into bed with each other and live happily ever after.  I was glad that I borrowed this instead of paid money for this as it was not worth either my time nor my money"
3,"I liked the Joker's Wild series...but this was my least favorite out of the three. All of the guys in these stories have 'issues' (who doesn't? LOL) but the main character here seemed rather disconnected. critical and just an odd man. Brody is described as drop dead gorgeous while Missy is a self-conscious. 'larger.' woman a few years Brody's junior. The point about Brody being upset when Missy would make fun of herself and Brody's refusal to deal with it was mentioned so many times I grew tired of it. And I never really 'got' why these two people became a couple. This one had less romantic attraction (in the beginning) than the other two in the series--it was more based on sexual attraction. But I still found the great writing style. interesting plot lines and interweaving with the other books in the series.This is worth reading. just read Three Nights and Call Me first!"
3,"I loved the first and the last book in this series. I thought the second book was much to heavy and the Chris and Eliza didn't have nearly as much fun as Kayla/Dylan and Missy/Brody did. I found myself laughing at loud at some of their antics and hot and bothered at most of the love scenes. As a plus-size woman I can truly understand her insecurities and though Brody was a handful I think he handled them fine. As someone who loves a domineering man I didn't have a problem with his heavy-handedness.This was a quick read for me and I will be revisiting this story again. You can't go wrong by adding this book to your library!"
3,"The day (Friday) before AJ is set to marry Kyle. she finds out her ex Cooper is going to be at the wedding.  Cooper is having trouble accepting that AJ has moved on. but plans to go to the wedding for closure.  Cooper's is a very distant relative to a god. Eros. who is bored and decides to complicate AJ and Cooper's lives.  Eros makes it where AJ and Cooper repeat Friday over and over again.  For a week solid they are repeating this day over.  AJ and Cooper are still very much in love. but are fighting it.This book kept me very entertained!  I got a total kick out of the bored got Eros.Great light read for everyone to read!"
3,"This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
3,"This was really fun read. It was also hot! It's Valentine's Day the day before your wedding and you find out the ex you really haven't got over is coming to the wedding looking for closure. but it causes old feelings to stir up for both of you. The morning of your wedding you wake up and it's Valentine's Day all over again. This happens to AJ and Cooper they relive the same day over and over again. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you relive a day over and over again. Will they grab this second chance at love?"
3,"I really like the stories I have read by this author. but this was my least favorite so far.  I usually really like this author and was disappointed by the book because it was just okay.  They story had a very interesting premise. but it was not fleshed out into the full story it deserved.  The shortness of the story makes Aislinn's capitulation a little too quick even though you know they have been working together for 6 months already. I would love to see this story worked out into a full novel by this author and see where it really goes.  It felt overly edited to fit within a certain number of pages.I will keep reading her books. but I just won't revisit this one."
3,"Novellas are not my favorite but I like Annmarie. so I thought I'd try it and I loved it.Whly? I have a storyline. a plot. a h and H.I know why Aislinn has an issue with trusting men.I know what Kyle has on his mind and I know what happens.How could I not love it!  Great story. yes longer would have been better but. it wasn't just sex. I got a story - I'm happy!And I know that The Strength of Three is the follow-up book with her friend Christina's story. fantastic!"
3,"We're very naive people because of living in a powerful. strong country but things could happen here in the U.S. as they do in other countries.  Jack Shane gives us a good look at what could occur.  Again Gary Weir of the CIA over rides those stupid people in the Pentagon that want to disband Bobby Autry's team because they're too good at what they do (hard to imagine).  The World Leaders are meeting in LA for 2 days and some group of agitators don't like it.  Bobby Autry's team is called in by Weir for help; every body get's shot up even Weir but he is considered one of Autry's team who end up saving his life along with the President. other world leaders. etc.  A fun Read. Again by Shane and it makes you think and come out of your 'La.La land'.  Cliff Mitts"
3,"Allan Quatermain is the final adventure of that hero as penned by the magnificent H. Rider Haggard.The beginning may the best I've ever read.  Who else but Haggard would start a story with the death of the main character's only child.  There is an amazing battle as well.The middle dragged pretty heavily for me.  However. that was redeemed by a thrilling finale.  Umslopogaas is a character that reaches out and grabs you. and his finale suited him well.  I have to think he was one of Haggard's favorite characters.Grab the free Kindle version. and you won't regret it."
3,"I enjoy when the main characters have a long history together.  This was the case in this novel.  I also enoyed the correspondence (through the use of letters) between the main characters.  It was a nice way to communicate the story in the first third of the novel.  With that being said. this novel added nothing else new to the romance genre.  The plot was a bit predictable and the ending was (as always) wrapped up perfectly in a nice neat bow.  Not too realistic.  But if you are looking for an easy beach read. this one is for you!"
3,"This is a cute little quick and I mean quick story. The plot or concept are 2 people writing each other and falling in love.  i must admit in the beginning the author includes the letters that they are writing each other.  For me it got a little annoying but it doesn't matter. Sean was crazy sexy and I loved Eve's personality. If you are the type that wants to feel connected to the characters on some deep level then this might not be for you as it's fast paste. The sex is a thumps up it was quick but still a thumps up."
3,"Eve Carmichael writes letters to co-worker Sean O'Callahan. stationed in Iraq as a reservist.  Their letters become sexier & sexier until she doesn't hear from him for 3 weeks & she's very worried.  Her best friend takes her to &#34;Male Call&#34;. a Chippendales-like show for her 30th birthday.  Sean surprises her as he performs with the male dancers.  Hoo- Rah!!!!  They get married & are very happy!!  Who wouldn't want their sexy guy to do a striptease for them!!!!!!  GREAT STORY!!!"
3,"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie and since it was short. I read it in between other books in my TBR list. It was just okay on all counts - as erotica. it was passable; the plot wasn't exciting. but I did make it through to the end (although there wasn't really a burning need to); the characterization was okay - if the author had fleshed out her characters more. and improved the dialogue. it would've made a better book. There was some heat to it. and some of it was written pretty well. so that helped move the story along a little more than it would have otherwise. Since I did finish it to the end. and didn't hate it. I rated it as a 2.5. rounded up to 3."
3,"Yes. much of this story (as with others in the Hot Zone series) is superficial and silly - old fashioned letter writing. suddenly falling in love with the computer geek from work. the entire scene at the male strip club. etc. But. that's kind of the fun of these stories. Personally. I'm a sucker for a hot military hero or cowboy romance. and Male Call (despite the awful pun) reeled me in. For an hour or so worth of reading. this story is definitely enjoyable."
3,"A very short story; I guess it's a novella but I didn't think it would be.  Also. not enough story. mostly sexual encounters - but then. it's that genre.  They're not great for story.Cord Daily has loved and wanted Cait Culver as long as he can remember. but her father threatened him then sent her to Paris for two years.  Now. she's back - and Cord takes the opportunity. with his cousin Dalton. to have a night with her.  He never knew that she wanted him. too.  But then her father finds out that Cord is now the owner of a race horse Mr. Culver wants.  Cait gets the absolutely wrong impression  - but Cord finds a way to make it right."
3,"9.99 for four stories sounds really good only problem is that the stories aren't good. I'm a fan of Lori Foster. I have loved some of her other books. but I can't even force myself to finish this one. I'm in the middle of story 3 and I just can't make myself care about the characters enough to keep reading. This will not be my last book by her but it will take a while for me to kindle another one by her.I first rated this bundle 2 stars but after going back and reading the last story I added a star. The last story I really like. maybe it's just story 3 and 4 that need a little help"
3,"The story was great. the printing format was terrible. It was very disconcerting to be reading and all of a sudden. the chapter would end without finishing the thought or the sentence; sometimes even the word wasn't finished. It just left one hanging and wondering what was supposed to been said or what was happening. Then the next chapter would start and you never knew what the heck was going on.. This happened at  the end of at least 10 chapters. It kept  breaking my concentration and frustrating me so much. it interfered with trying to enjoy the book.  I would like to try this book again sometime if it was edited and corrected."
3,"There are. perhaps. a few places where the characters' past history and current personalities might not stand up to close scrutiny -- but the turns of phrase are quite deft. and the characters are simply _fun._ so I'm not inclined to quibble. The faintest besmirching of the overall entertainment is a duel which has a slight jump and feel of 'insert duel here' in the author's notes. but that's the only part which got my mind hiccuping.The other reviews cover details quite well enough. and the bits that I really. really liked. I can't say or it'll spoil the snickers. (There is quite a fair dose of humor here and there!) Unfortunately. the first of those is just _after_ the sample text ends."
3,"I already liked the cheeky hero from reading about him in the first book. An Inconvenient Duchess. Always love a bad boy! What makes this story so funny to me is him trying his best to stay out of the heroine's clutches (well. not really clutches) and maintaining his honor.  It is quite the turn around from a rakish hellion!  I started and finished the story in one day - it is a quick - but satisfying - read.  It flows smoothly and has just enough tension.  It isn't deep but it is good and I'm heading out to find more of her stories!"
3,"Esme is abused by her father after her mother leaves them.  Seeking a way out she is going to marry until she realizes the man is just as awful (and as old as) her father.  When she witnesses the scene across the street she decides that Captain Radwell is the man to ruin her and get her away from her father.  What she doesn't count on is the honorable streak that he is trying to have.  He delivers her to his brother and his wife for help.  And then he sticks around.  Great read!"
3,"All in all a great read. I would have given this book five stars except there were some repetitive thought processes in the beginning that had me saying 'alright already - I get it... he wants to stay but he's afraid she'll recognize him and reject him or turn him in'. (reminders would have been okay. but perhaps less wordy ones) However. by nearly half way in the book it moves away from that. There's plenty of action and suspense throughout. and a nice romance to boot."
3,"The summary seemed cute and interesting and the story is...until you meet Stacy. This is a heroine you want to like after you hear of her past and her heroic actions but then it's near impossible to like her.Gina Wilkins had potential in this story but it gets weighted down and just plain eye-rolling when it you have an extremely Stacy not even trying while Jake is giving and showing just how nice of a man he is.Ms. Wilkins emasculates Jake Hinson completely turning him into Stacy Carter's new dog...simpering. whimpering and pleading for Stacy to throw him a bone. Oscar the Yorkie disappears and Ms. Wilkins makes Jake his replacement in a quick transition.I definitely won't ever read another Gina Wilkins book if this is the way she writes her men."
3,"I love Susan Mallery's more recent books (try the Fool's Gold series) so when I saw older books had been rereleased. I had to buy it. I was really happy I bought parts 1 & 2 at the same time. so I didn't have to pause between books. You don't have to read them in order. the books can all stand alone. but you will understand the dynamics better if you do. And if you love stories about people finding the loves of their lives. you will love this series."
3,"These four books are some of Crusie's earlier books so they are shorter than most of her newer novels and the plotlines are not quite as well developed but her trademark humor and loveable characters are present in spades! These books are all great summer reads and at $10 for the set this is a steal!I think 'Getting Rid of Bradley' is by far the best of the four followed by 'Strange Bedpersons' and 'Charlie All Night'. 'What the Lady Wants' is the weakest of the four in my opinion but it is still very readable.Enjoy!"
3,"I do agree that I would like to have spent more time with these characters. I was very bummed when it just ended. and i do agree it could have used more depth. But I really loved these characters. For what they were. in the length given. they popped. Book reads very much like a brilliant fantasy. Like all her stories so far. the story has a sweet quality to it. but very hot. I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was and look forward to more from this author."
3,"I own this book in paperback- and spent more than what the on line/download price that's for sure. And what they are asking for now is about how much I think it's probably worth.It's not one I re-read. The stories go by so quick. there's no time to get involved in the characters or feel for them at all. The one story I halfway got into- the honeymoon/castaway story- I ended up wondering how things work out for them- wished it was it's own book."
3,"Just finished the second book &#8220;View To Kill&#8221; in this very sensational storyline. what can you say about characters that are so well written that they grab you from the beginning and not let go even after the story is finished.  This story maybe short but it is a joy to read. to devour and not want the story to end. the character of Sachin was terrific. he saved her. watched her as she matured into a fantastic women. and how he loves her. he definitely has a wonderful match in Paige. a perfect pair."
3,"This was a great follow up to King of Prey. The main character in this is the right hand man of the King of Hawks. Sachin meets his mate when she is to young to claim but he continues to visit her as she grows up. After mistakes are made and trust is lost Sachin must figure out what he wants and how to hang on to it.I liked how this book went with a different approach to how the main characters meet and their relationship progresses. There was no instant love with them flying off into the sunset. It was a more real love with a undeniable passion between the two that is common in the paranormal romances. I enjoyed following both characters and learning about them. their pasts and their futures.Again I love this series and so far out of all the books this one was my favorite. I definitely recommend this to fans of Paranormal Romance or shifter stories.*I received this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review.*"
3,"Dee Knight had a really great story line here that could have yielded a fantastic book. This is a sweet story. She did a great job with the characters. I would have loved to see her expand it. The sex is too short. the scenes are too short. It's difficult to get worked up about anything that happens in the story. I'd love to see her rewrite it and lengthen it out!(71 pages per Amazon. but a lot of excerpts from other Samhain Publishing are included.  This publisher has may favorite author Lorelei James.)"
3,"K.A. Mitchell is my favorite M/M author. her ability to create realistic characters is amazing.  I love that in this story both men would be what I would call Alpha types. even though it's primarily Jeff in charge. Ryan also steps up.  Very realistic storyline. Jeff can't let out that he's gay for fear of losing the time he has with his daughter. Ryan was in the Air Force so he's been in that same scenario where he has to hide that part of him. The sex scenes this author writes are incredibly descriptive & erotic; makes me feel a little like a voyeur!I do agree with the other reviewers that the book does end abruptly and hope the story is continued.What I didn't like: 2/3 of the book is the story. the last 1/3 of the kindle book is advertisements for other books to read/buy.  So very short story. but still a great quick read that I feel was worth the price."
3,"If I hadn't been reading this book on my kindle I would have torn it to pieces! This is one of those books where the villain gleefully tells his soon-to-be victem about his evil plan and. because he took so long gloating. was killed. And the heroine was so pathetic and annoying that I wanted her to die. All of that freezing in fear and fainting. Gag! Not only that. but. for a character who is supposed to be intelligent. she couldn't even figure out who the villain was when he was standing in front of her with a gun pointed at her. There was plenty more that I could complain about. but it annoys me just thinking about it!"
3,"This was actually part of the Dragon Knight series but introduced some characters that would be beneficial to the upcoming books in that series.  If you are looking for hot sex then this has it but it also has a great story line and introduces characters that become common place as the Dragon Knights series progresses.  The young woman in this book was of strong character although a little lost and we actually saw some flaws in the Dragon Knights she becomes involved with.  I liked where the author took this story and look forward to more in this series."
3,"I HAVE NOW READ ALL OF THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES. LOVED EVERYONE OF THEM. THE CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING. I HIGHLEY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES TO ANYONE WHO LOVES ROMANCE. ACTION. SECRETS. SEX. INTRIGUE. I HAVE EVEN PRE-ORDERED THE NEXT BOOK THAT IS DUE OUT IN AUGUST. I CAN'T WAIT. BIANCA D'ARC WRITING IS AMAZING. ONCE I GET THROUGH READING THIS SERIES. I AM GOING TO START READING HER OTHER BOOKS. IF THEY ARE HALF AS GOOD AS THIS SERIES. THEY WILL BE AWSOME. THANK YOU BIANCA FOR GIVING ME A WONDERFUL TIME READING YOUR BOOKS."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
3,"This is Maris Mackenzie's story. She is working as a horse trainer for a prestigious owner in Kentucky and wakes up one morning to find herself in bed with a man she doesn't know. Maris finds herself in the middle of an investigation involving insurance fraud but realizes she's met the man she's going to marry.While Maris' journey to the altar is a short one. what's engaging about the story is when she and Alex MacNeil return to Ruth. Wyoming to meet the MacKenzie clan. It's an opportunity to check in on the other members of the family and watch Alex face the wrath of five brothers who question his motives.It is an entertaining story and any excuse to revisit MacKenzie Mountain makes it worthwhile."
3,"Maris' story is 2 1/2 stars for me. the bump to a half star owing to the gathering of the family at the end. The story. unfortunately. suffers from telling and not showing plot details. The chemistry between Maris and Alex suffers from this as well. The reader is thrown into the present without adequate descriptions of past meetings and attraction between the couple. (The suspenseful aspect to the novel also suffers from this.) Flashback scenes would have helped tremendously. Those familiar with the Mackenzie Family books expect instant attraction between the hero and heroine. but it's just not developed in this one."
3,"Langley never fails to deliver. I love a good shifter tale and this one definitely pleases. Dev is a reluctant hero. rising to the occasion to save his mate. Lainey. from an abusive alpha. Lainey is a spunky. cute. klutz who keeps his handsome mate. and the reader. laughing and groaning in turns at his antics. This fast-paced. sensual story kept me turning pages to find out what happened next. This one has a permanent place on my reader. because once wasn't enough."
3,"From the beginning. this book is charming and funny. Laine's character is quirky. sweet. adorable. and hilarious. His penchant for getting himself into trouble combined with being a total klutz makes this character completely lovable. There are other characters that you fall in love with as well: Grammy. Laine's grandmother. Cole (Dev's best friend) and Cole's mate. Caroline. who. like Laine. has a penchant for getting into trouble and is a complete and total klutz. This story is short yet sweet that I truly enjoyed reading. Laine keeps Dev on his toes with his shenanigans which will keep you giggling throughout the story. This was an enjoyable read.See Kiwi's complete 4 sweet pea review at mrsconditreadsbooks.com/index.php/?p=12096"
3,"I laughed an awful lot reading this book. I loved it! But. then again. I'm a sucker for stories involving a Toppy Top and a Mouthy Bottom.Laine is absolutely adorable. He is the biggest klutz with the worst coordination and driving record on the planet. He says exactly what pops into his head. Devlin is an Alpha looking to relocate his pack. Dev is dominant. sexy. strong. smart and has a great sense of humor. Good thing too since his best friends wife and Laine are both catalysts for disaster.This is a wonderful short read that I truly wish was longer."
3,"This whole 'instantly recognizing your mate' thing -- I TOTALLY LOVE THAT! And the eyes and teeth 'shifting' when emotions run high. very cool!! If you like the genre. you'll like this: family. loyalty. friends. and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action. and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not. if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it."
3,"I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.  J.L.. have you been reading my journal?  LOL...  Really though these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again."
3,"I thought this was a quick read. Or perhaps I liked it soo much. I was able to read it fast. It only took me a few hours if that. It was pretty face paced. I hope to see more of Dev and Laine. I enjoyed it. It jumped right into the action and didn't slow down.Dev is new to town. He and his best friend Cole(and his mate Caroline) are going to be relocating for work. Dev stumbles upon a the local pack assualting there Omega. He get angry and goes to recue him. Laine. the local Omega and doesn't have a filter on his mouth. He says what is on his mind. Both to their joy. they realized early on in the book they are destined to be mates. When the local pack Alpha continues to torment Laine. Dev has to decide what he will do to proctect his new lover/mate."
3,"After reading the sample for this I was disappointed by the rest of it. It seemed like there would be more mature writing and a deeper plot. However. the plot is rather simple and most of the characters feel two dimensional and at times almost annoying. Laine and one of the other characters in particular were weak characters. The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature. Now while this can be a part of a character. no one is perfect after all. there was no depth added to make that clumsy characteristic endearing or to show that Laine could act like more than a teenager. At least the book had more than sex and there was plot progession. but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this story. even for the cheap price. It's short and doesn't really make the reader feel any emotion."
3,"Fans of the 'with' series should recognise the overall wold in this short story.  While this could be read as an unofficial prequel to the series. as these characters are mentioned briefly (though not by name) in Without Reservations. if you are unfamiliar with these novels I would read it after the first full novel.  I enjoyed this one and didn't find Laine irritating like some others did; not everyone can be perfect and it was a nice change from some other shorts I've read.  If you enjoy the series you'll probably like this addition to it as well. I did."
3,"I read the first story in this series and thoroughly enjoyed it. I went on a buying spree and got the other two as well as this short story. I suppose Laine's antics were meant to be comedic relief but I did not laugh not once. His antics were not funny. I did not buy Devlin being so amused by Laine's antics.I was shocked with how they resolved the conflict with Victor. I thought it was a weak plot point. This story was just ok. I wouldn't recommend anyone spending the money to buy it. If it were free. then yes."
3,"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate. Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership."
3,"Lady Amelia has decided to take a lover. Announcing it to her husband over breakfast probably wasn't the way to begin this adventure.Victoria Alexander has a way of making me laugh that no one else does! The antics of this husband and wife are truely hilarious. She really doesn't want a lover - just her husband's attention. He really doesn't want her to take a lover - but he offers to help. They both enlist the help of his twin brother and renowned rake in achieving their true goal.It really is one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time - and Victoria Alexander is always a favorite!"
3,"Very brief story.  Enjoyable but not a lot to it.  The hero and heroine have been married long enough to fall into a rut.  The husband. a twin. has always wondered whether his wife might have preferred his brother (because the twins had swapped places a couple of times during the married couples courtship because the husband has always felt less socially adept than his twin).  The heroine has always been able to tell the difference between the twins and has never doubted she married the twin that she wanted to marry.  Still. they've settled into comfortableness and she wants passion (and she fears her husband may have strayed --though he hasn't).  Over breakfast she makes an outrageous statement about possibly taking a lover. jolting her loving if inattentive  husband into action.Nice story. Loving couple. It's just a short story. however."
3,"This book was not bad at all.  I don't think I've ever read something quite like the plot of this book before.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you like the fantasy or urban fantasy type novels. I think you might like this one.  Be aware that this book has some rather racy bits in it. so I don't think kids should probably read it.  The only problem with this book for me is that it has no chapter demarcations.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how far along a person is in a book and how close a person is to the end of a chapter when he/she needs to find a stopping place at times.  Give it a shot because it might be just a bit of escapist fun for a while.  Have at it!  I liked the characters and I can't wait to read the next one."
3,"I give it five stars.Unbreakable by Sydney Somers is a fantastic action filled story. in the tradition of Buffy The Vampire Slayer that I found almost impossible to put down. The chemistry between the main characters as well as the secondary ones is outstanding.When the story first starts Jordan and her partner / lover Gage are brutally attacked by a war demon and in the process the fatally injured Gage ends up dying in her arms.Fast forward five years into the future. Jordan is still a cop by day but by night she's an a** kicking demon slayer with an attitude! So imagine her anger and hurt when she discovers that Gage didn't really die that night. Instead he's stayed away for the last five years in a misguided attempt to protect her from the shadow demons that she hunts and slays every night.This book is definitely a keeper. If you love stories about demons. heroes. hot sex and a great love that won't be denied then you are sure to love Unbreakable."
3,"I confess that I had read these before. many years ago.  I got a special offer for the Kindle version of all six books at one time and decided it might be nice to revisit.  And it was.  So much so that at the end of the last one I immediately (at 1:00 AM) popped on site and ordered the next six delivered to my Kindle for uninterrupted reading.  I recommend these if you like a good storyline.  There are Vampires and other aspects of the supernatural as well as political aspects. romance and some violence; albeit of the non horrific type.  Read these anytime. daytime or night time.  You won't loose sleep you will gain a desire for the dark."
3,"This series of books had  some of the best Vampire stories I've ever read.  Fast paced. great. lovable characters. and plenty of action. not to mention sexual tension throughout..real page turners.  They made me want to be part of  the &#34;family&#34;!  lol  I want to read the next series. but will probably have to wait till someone gives me a gift card.  The price on the second series is a little prohibitive for me.  On the other hand. these books are definitely worth it. if yo love to read about &#34;lovable vampires&#34;."
3,"This is not my first time reading this collection. I have the paperback copies that I have kept over the years. It is a totally engrossing set of books. Maggie Shayne is one of my favorite paranormal authors. one that I can be sure when I pick up one of her books. I will enjoy it.Wings in the Night. Part 1 contains six wonderful tales about the creatures of the night known as vampires. I read that Maggie's line of vampire stories are the original ones. the ones that came before. You will see they are people just like you and me. You'll fall in love at least once. Maybe more.If you like paranormal romance. get this collection. You won't be disappointed. All I was disappointed in was that I couldn't give it more than five stars. I am looking forward to obtaining more of her books for the Kindle or Nook."
3,"I became attached to the characters. I liked the series for the most part. I only had 2 complaints. The characters kept saying that they weren't monsters. that they are the same people they were before immortality (which I agree). However. the author kept calling it the dark gift. I didn't like that. It's either that they're good people just different or they are dark monsters. You can't be both. The other thing. I'm not sure how to put into words. but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example. Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this. I got the point the 1st 2 times they explained their thoughts and feelings.  For the most part. I liked the series. Just these 2 points bothered me."
3,"The Wings on the Night series is enchanting! This series was the series that led me to Maggie Shayne. who I adore. I fell in love with the vampires from her series & reading this collection only served to deepen that love! I own this entire series. but I jumped on the chance to own this collection on my Kindle app. Part one contains some of my favorite characters - Rihanna. Roland. Tamara. Eric. and list goes on and on! Grab this collection and step into the enchanting stories of the immortal vampire! Embrace the night & fall in love with these amazing characters!P.S. Maggie is getting read to return to these characters in a new series! Catch up one your reading while we wait For the new novels!"
3,"Deidre Nelson is back in Ventura Texas watching over her parent's bedand breakfast while they are away. Jonas Mendez is the town's sheriff.The last time Deidre and Jonas saw each other was to say goodbyebefore Deidre left for New York ten years ago.Ten years is a long time. but the attraction that simmered betweenDeidre and Jonas is as strong as ever and the anticipation of whatmight become of it is even stronger!Anticipation is the perfect title for Jonas and Deidre's story.  Ilove how they got back what they once had. Of course this time. it'sbetter than before!  There is a lot of heat and heart in Anticipation;it's a sexy and very romantic story.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
3,"I tried this book because I wanted something light and happy for this Christmas season.  I was very surprised to find it concerned an older hotel in San Francisco. one of my most favorite cities.  The heroine was a strong woman and she meets a man who is instantly attracted to her.  She is a little klutzy but all sorts of fun.  Personally. I can relate to that. I read this book I one short evening and think you'd enjoy this romance too.  If nothing else. it is a little different from the usual Contemporary Romance.  Happy Reading!"
3,"Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book. and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care. but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!"
3,"Recently stating that I very seldom find a 5 star book. I have now read 2 in a row. Naturally I'm pleased! I have read Stephanie Bond before but nothing as good as this book. Hero is reviewing a hotel recently bought by a big corporation. He stays at the hotel without the manager's. Cindy aka heroine. knowledge. HILARIOUS happenstances start on the first page and continue throughout the book. Cindy is hard working. lovable. and accident prone; but a good hotel manager. Eric (hero) is there to do a hatchet job on the hotel. he's crazy about the heroine and wants to pad the report. but does not. Chemistry is great between the H/h.... naturally needed in a good romance. and the humor is top notch. Great..Great..Read. I highly recommend this book and I thank Ms. Bond for the entertainment."
3,"I have read just about everything this author has written and decided to read this series. even though it seemed to be very raunchy. This book isn't quite as steamy as the first book and I found that I really enjoyed it. I like the way the author develops her characters and I like the way there is no insurmountable misunderstanding. I love the way the H's always fall head over heels for the h's despite not wanting to and despite they are alpha's. I love a good romance and this author always delivers!"
3,"I think I would have really liked this book had it not been the descriptions of size for the male lead.  I mean c'mon!!!!  There really is such a thing as 'too big' and this is up there with HELL NO!  Every time I started to get back into the story and care about the characters here comes another description of 'the cannon'.  It just got to be utterly ridiculous!  And EVERY male is of that proportion?  Not to repeat myself but really. ridiculous!"
3,"So. this book is long. and packed with lots of sex. The story is ok...but it seems to really just be background for sex scene after sex scene. To me. some of the descriptions of the sex went to the cheesey side of sex...rather than the erotic...but it was hot. And the description of his 'cannon' and use of it as a name...really?I guess I only gave it 3 stars because there really could have been more story here. I would have liked for it to have gone on in the end a little as to how it actually ended. To me. it just sorta stopped.So. If you are into hot and heavy steamy sex this is the book for you. If you want story with a side of steamy sex. this may be a bit much."
3,"I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have passed over this book. It just did not look that interesting and it seemed like this was the one and only book written by Samantha Cruise so it cannot be that good. can it?Boy was I ever wrong! This is the most eroctic. most sensual. most passionate. most sexiest. hottest. steamiest. most graphic book I have ever read. Did I say hot. did I say sexy. did I say extremely eroctic. then let me repeat myself again! I am not sure if Samantha Cruise has written any other books and to date I have not been able to find any but I hope she writes more books. This book was so hot that made I left my husband a very happy man! I would highly recommend this book! Great Job Ms. Cruise!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"we all remember our first loves.. not many of us thought it was the forever love of our lives.. we have go through high school thinking we have met the love of our lives till something happens and you can't stand to be in the same room with that person. Payton and Lizzie have that kind of love.. I couldn't put this book down.. he was SO mean to lizzie when he thought that he had to be.. but in the end sometimes you hurt the people/person that you love the most..i can't wait to see if there will be other books by this author.. if they are anything like 'the heart will lead you home' i would buy it in a second.. you won't regret this book purchase.."
3,"The first three of these books fit together wonderfully as the opening trilogy of the John Carter of Mars series.  For pure fantasy adventure. few books have topped these.  The other two are somewhat lesser works but still very enjoyable.If  you are interested in Sword and Planet fiction for the kindle ebook. you should also check out the Alan Burt Akers series. which are direct descendents of Burroughs.  Transit to Scorpio is the first in that series.I would also recommend my own Talera series. which includes Swords of Talera. Wings Over Talera. and Witch of Talera. They are also available as ebooks. I see a lot of folks brag on their own books but I am proud of these books. and if you look at the reviews under the paperback versions you'll see that others enjoy them as well and consider them excellent modern continuations of the Sword and Planet tradition."
3,"Burroughs' Barsoom novels were among the first science fantasy books I read as a child long ago. In fact. I still have all eleven volumes in their original Ballantine Books paperbacks stashed in a box. along with numerous works by Heinlein. Clarke. Asimov. and others from the 1960's and 70's that I can't stand the idea of giving up. At least I know I can read them digitally when I want to. Too bad the entire series isn't part of this set.Burroughs' writing style would be considered comically stereotyped and hackneyed by modern standards. but the themes of chivalry. bravery. and respect for others are timeless - even though they might be considered out of style by modern standards. Some ideas are worth preserving. and IMO these types of stories do that very well.I grew up with these types of stories. I want to make sure my grandson can. too."
3,"After seeing the recent major movie. I was prompted to pursue re-reading the original series of novels. I found them to be highly entertaining and as captivating as when I read them long ago. The writing is good. if a bit 'dated'. but Burroughs can still hold your attention. His writting may seem a little juvenile to some but I (at 70+) was thrilled time and again as I read them on my KIndle. I recommend them to all who simply wish to read a series purely for the entertainment value."
3,"The real star in this book is the author.  The writing. although somewhat baroque. is fascinating.  This is the product of a real wordsmith.  Considering when this was written and what the subject matter is. it's hard to put down.  The story. however. is a bit primitive.  I read the story before I found out they were making a movie of it.  Unfortunately the movie was a box office bomb.  If the film is true to the book. I can understand that because I don't think many would have read the book first and the real joy is in the writing. not necessarily the story."
3,"Girl meets boy and they get married. Nevertheless. the author writes quite well which made it more interesting to me; however. the constant interruptions that she included to keep the main couple apart got irritating! Also.if I had realized that she would include explicit gross sex scenes. I probably never would have chosen this book as I don't think her first book was so overly sexual. I prefer Anne Perry.s type of writing about both love and the customs of 18th century England. Or more like Jane Austin."
3,"Since her father's death. Penny's been plagued by troubles on the ranch and sinister characters have been lurking about. and though she doesn't like the idea much. she feels she has no choice but to send for a mail order husband. dreaming of a knight in shining armor coming to right all her problems. despite her professed pessimism regarding the scheme. Penny and Jace were such engaging characters. making great equal partners when it was called for. but also falling easily into the more traditional roles of meek woman and strong. protective man at other times. and it was fascinating to see the movement back and forth between the two. The mistaken assumptions on both sides throughout the story became frustrating and by the end it was heartbreaking to see the characters following through with noble actions that neither of them wanted. I'm glad it all worked out in the end. but I wish things could have been resolved a bit sooner. The humorous bits sprinkled throughout the story were great!"
3,"This is probably the last book I would pick out to read on my own.  I read Alien Agenda. so I was familiar with the works of Steve Peek. I was more than just pleasantly surprised.  Reality is often stranger than anything we could imagine.It starts out like a horror/werewolf story but quickly becomes a credible account of creatures coming through energy portals into this world from a parallel universe.I gave it 5 Stars for being well written. hard to put down. character development. the way the author tied everything together and the fact that every time I thought I had it figured out I was wrong! Doh!Definitely worth reading. And. if you haven't read Alien Agenda. get them both."
3,"Author Steve Peek has created a world that embraces many legends. werewolves. vampires. the like. as beings of an alternate dimension. Gates allow them passage to out world. Ancient humans had learned ways to shut those doors down. building such as Stonehenge. the Indian mounds of the Americas. and other such structures around the world. But as humans spread and built. those impediments were destroyed. weakening those lines connected worldwide.And a pack of Longclaws have found a way to cross over into our world. In their own dimension. they are far down the food chain. In our world. they are incredibly fast with claws protruding from hands made for slashing. cutting up their prey.In northern Alabama forests. cut off by a collapsed bridge and rivers swollen by the torrential rains. there will be a battle between the clan of longclaws and two families. the Masons. from a long line that watched the mounds for just such an event. and an old Indian woman and her granddaughter.Most excellent."
3,"Author Steve Peek will have me sleeping with the lights on for a while. I thought I was over being afraid of the dark. but not after reading this book... Why do I need the lights on?Answer: Longclaws...Steve Peek's writing style is masterful. unique. Just take a peek between the covers... He has written a story that addresses the human condition. our capacity to deal with the unimaginable. and find a way to carry on. I totally enjoyed everything about this book: the plot. the characters. the style. the pace. its unpredictability. and above all. even my coming nightmares when I turn out the lights! I highly recommend this book.Reviewed by Thomas Jerome BakerAuthor ofStory Tellers: In Pursuit of Happiness"
3,"Not a bad book. but too long and drawn-out. The character development of some characters was fabulous while others not so much. It was a very odd mix. I did like the story and the writing. The author has definitely got some talent. but I felt it could use a little red pen love from an editor.The character I most enjoyed was Kelly. but I thought she kind of became minimized towards the end. whereas I really expected to her to have a larger part in the ending.If you like Stephen King and have a Kindle. grab this one. it's not all that expensive and is a good read."
3,"Although I am not a fan of Sci-Fi. I enjoyed this book and will look forward to more from this author. Small town characters. good writing. a little horror. a little medical. it's all there. I'm a little old for things that are too far fetched and unbelievable so I found the tree goddess thing a bit too much for my tastes. He writes like Stephen King in his younger days. and I was reminded of Pet Sematary as I was reading this story.I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. William's work in the future and I. for one. can't wait!"
3,"This was a fast paced tale.  It started off so innocently in the Holy Land with a pleasant trip with just a hint of something wrong.  Greg's  senses were picking up little nuances. but couldn't quite put a finger on what was bothering him.  Just too many coincidences.  After they got home. the fun started.  With Jill kidnapped he had to pull out all the stops and call in every favor he could.  As this is the beginning of the series. it made you think a little harder.  Loved the relationship and the genuine love between them.  A great read.  Recommend reading all this series."
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
3,"This is a very good book. I got it this morning and just finished it. Once I started reading I just could not put it down. Well written with plenty of action. Nice to have an older hero wth vices of trying to quit smoking and holding his temper in control. Neither of which he does very well. There are other reviews that tell you about the main character and plot both of which are very good. I just warn you not to start the book at bedtime as you are sure to lose sleep because you can't put it down."
3,"This not a book; so lets call it a not-book.'  It starts by claiming that it is against the Constitution to hide information about UFOs.The cover is not only at the beginning but in 2 other places.This is the first not-book I have gotten from Amazon.  The 3 covers AND several reader comments (can we spell advertisements) made the experience of this non-book just about worthless.I can understand when an author states that this is the beginning (James Patterson comes to mind)of a book to encourage a reader to buy the rest of the book; unfortunately Mr. Wilkenson did not say that.I would not recommend this non-book to anyone because the lack of material and using reader comments as advertising.  Don't waste your time."
3,"This 'book' contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to. maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh. and of course the obligatory link to the author's other 'books'.Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover. title-page. a couple of blank pages. and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
3,"Even for an essay. this is startlingly devoid of information and features a lot of repetition. It does not offer any reasoning on the topic that cannot be culled from any of the hundreds of full-length books on the topic. and the conclusions have already been reached elsewhere many time. If I wasn't agreeable to the subject matter or those conclusions. this would've easily rated a one-star review; but at least the author had the guts to put it out there - I'll give him that for chutzpah."
3,"Of course. having read 'Surfacing' would have been even better. but this review urges you. compels you to do just that.Its message has been heard before. told by Thoreau. Emerson. Greek philosophers and Indian American shamans: there is more than meet the eye. and only communing with Nature will bring us back to our true nature. Silence speaks volumes to the eager soul ready to change its human life. Strength is found in every day details proving us what we are made of.The quest of 'Surfacing' happens in the wilderness of Canada and its ruthless cold. it could have happened on an island. in the desert. anywhere removed from shopping malls. Starbucks and civilization. The Journey within is worth the read...we then become self-fulfilling. self-made. self-reliant."
3,"A really short &#34;Cliff-Notes-Esque&#34; essay on Margaret Atwood's book. &#34;Surfacing&#34; which dealt with the issues of national and gendered identity. anticipated rising concerns about conservation and preservation and the emergence of Canadian nationalism. The book is complex in the layering of the characters and subject matter with separation being forefront.Margaret Atwood's book has been compared to the likes of Jack Kerouac's On the Road. and to Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar. and rightfully so. A fair comparison of this essay. Stopping the World. to Atwood's book would be like an essay on Herman Melville's Moby Dick with the contents of said essay stating that Moby Dick is about about a man and a fish. While true at a elementary level. would completely miss the point and that is my conclusion with this essay. it seems to completely miss the point of Atwood's message.However I must give merit for an imaginative piece that does try to make apple juice out of oranges."
3,"I've read several books by this author and find myself completely baffled by this poor example of her writing.  The storytelling was so simplistic that it came across as the first work of a freshman English major.  I trained FBI agent would make out with a federal judge whose life is in danger up against his car out in the open?  Story totally lacked realism.  What a waste.  Save your money.  If you like this author avoid this book.  It will sully your better memories of her writing."
3,"I've read other books by this author that are much better than this poorly executed story. It isn't as long as you would think. It started at 2% and ended at 88%. An abrupt ending without really answering some points brought up in the book. A lot of promise with no follow through is what this book amounted to for me. I would not recommend this book to a friend. I say go spend your money on one of the many other wonderful m/m stories available. It moved way too quickly to even make sense. I love you in less than 24 hours. really?"
3,"Some M/M fiction is plot and character driven. with a spicy romance in there somewhere.  This is the writing style that interests me.Other M/M fiction is just a series of sex scenes hung on a flimsy plot.  'Court Appointed' is an example of this type.  I didn't even find the sex scenes compelling. since neither the characters nor their interest in each other were skillfully developed.  I posit too that people in imminent danger of being murdered are not likely to take time out for some nookie while they are still in an extremely vulnerable locale.  Nor are they likely to take even more time to make a phone call from that locale - a call that could easily and safely be completed via cell phone as they sped away to a safehouse.Wish I could figure out which kind of tales these are before buying - its not always obvious."
3,"This may be short but it manages to achieve a lot on all fronts. Hot sex. 2 well developed characters who easily grow on you. tender. touching and emotional moments and a nice plot. I prefer this one to Diving Deep. the longer story from Mitchell. The initial setting is really amusing as both characters meet over a rubbish dump. Cade may be the more experienced. flamboyant and older one but his failed relationship with a 'jerk' has left him vulnerable and lonely. Elliot is a young man. almost a virgin. but romantic at heart believing in finding one true love. They seem very different and you would have thought Cade would have preferred a more exprienced and older lover. But Elliot's persistence and sincerity would win the most hard hearted. Love the chemistry between the 2 men. I would love to read more about this couple making it lasts. A great novella."
3,"I had read all these years ago.  I recently found Wings in the Night Part 1 for a real deal and decided to download to my kindle and revisit one of my favorite series from long ago.  I got caught up again.  I then immediately upon finishing part 1 downloaded Wings in the Night Part 2 and read all of them.  I am now looking on the Wings in the Night Web Site and checking for Rhiannon's Chronicles and info on the new books coming out.  This series does not disappoint.  It matters not if you are revisiting it or if you are a first timer.  It will set the scene for the new books and/or give you a great series for your immediate enjoyment.  I highly recommend."
3,"These stories were just not on a par with the original. TWILIGHT PHANTASIES. and I was so disappointed.  Now this is just my take on this.  Maggie Shayne is a good writer and these could possibly be right down your alley.  I am merely stating that I was so excited to read all of her series but the first book was the best to me.  Her vampires do not possess all the traits of other vampire characters I have read - they don't have as many skills.  Also. they think they are so wonderful they are constantly putting themselves in harms way as though they are not all that bright.  Just off somehow."
3,"I'm used to Julia James doing really involved books. where she leads you to think that the heroine is undesirable but in the end turns out to be the most awesome kind of woman there is. And I don't like her other type of book. I really liked this little book. if it could be called a book. The very first book of hers that I read was The Greek's Million-Dollar Baby. which was of good enough quality for me to proceed to buy at least 5 more of her books within the following days. and this is easily better."
3,"In the final installment to the Affair Series I was riveted by the story of love. betrayal. and forgiveness between the characters. Crandall Thorne was his usual hard mouthed and manipulative self. but you also got to see the vulnerable side of him. The side that longed for the one woman he could never fully have. Dane Roarke was awesome!! I loved him. He knew what he wanted the moment he set eyes on Solange Washington. and he went for it. And even though Solange had doubts about him and him so called womanizing ways. she couldn't help but get sucked into the vortex of passion that was him. Their story was a true love story from start to finish. They showed that if you love someone you can forgive almost anything and make it work. Great story. Fantastic series!!!"
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
3,"I do like m&eacute;nage books...however I much prefer when the female gets ALLLLL of the attention.  Yes. I am selfish that way.  That's my guilty pleasure when I read.  With that being said I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review.  So in fairness I went back and read the ARC again.  I was given a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review.  After my second read I decided on a 5 star review simply because this story has what it needs.  It's short. but you are introduced to the characters without feeling rushed.  You get enough background info on each so that it makes sense without any extra fluff.  There were a couple of odd sentences or typos but nothing that would make you regret the time it takes you to read this novella."
3,"I love On the Edge! Meeting Brett. Leo and Lisa through the out of the box series made me want to know soo much more about these characters. If you haven't read the out of the box set. On the edge is a great introduction to what you will get a whole lot more of in the rest of the series. HOT scenes between the trio. and the different combinations of duos too. I just reread the story again. and the second time around it is still as good as the first... now seriously thinking about reading the rest of them again too :P I love the personalities. and they all play off of each other in great ways. Thanks Kallysten for continuing to keep me aroused. entertained. and eagerly awaiting what ever series instalment you have coming out next. :)"
3,"This is a short story that give you an insight to the series of On The Edge .. Brett owner to a club that not only caters to Vampire but humans as well.. and his girlfriend of 11 months... And how Leo well you gotta read...There is a M/M. M/F. M/F/M scenes not graphic...I found the book to be interesting and different... Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series...I received to book for an honest review and with being a spoiler I found the book to be 4 stars. thanks"
3,"My Thoughts - 5 out of 5 unicorns - I loved it!!!**Gifted to me by the author for an honest reviewOkay first things. this is a very adult erotic short story.  It is only about 25 pages. and it does have some very steamy sex scenes including some M/M/F.The cover is okay and shows the characters. but it doesn&#8217;t grab my attention.  You definitely don&#8217;t want to judge this book by its cover.Okay I loved this story. but if you aren&#8217;t into stories of threesomes or sex scenes then don&#8217;t read this story.  It is a quick read. but it totally had my attention.  You get glimpses into the lives of the 3 characters in this book and some background.  I&#8217;m not usually one for short stories. but Kallysten always does such a fantastic job of sucking me right into her stories.I totally recommend this book to paranormal romance lovers and to anyone who loves Kally&#8217;s work.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more of this series in the future."
3,"Brett. the human and Lisa. the vampire. are quite the couple.  They are the owners of &#34;On The Edge&#34; bar and they're looking for another bartender.  Along comes Leo looking for a job but before he can apply he sees Lisa and she sees him.  Old lovers who forgot why they were no longer together.  Can Lisa talk Brett into letting Leo share their bed?  Read this steamy short and find out if Brett and Lisa gain a bartender and a third in their bed.Kallysten does it again!  Fabulous steamy short stories that leave you wanting so much more."
3,"My. my. my my........Good lord Kallysten you sure know how to bring a reader to the edge.  I immediately formed a perfect picture in my mind of Bret. Lisa and Leo and watching it play out before me in the written word just proved to me that as far as an erotic paranormal writer goes. you are on top.  The story maybe short but the reader will not feel short changed when finished.  I guess if there are really vampires out there. they need somewhere to go where they can let their hair hang down and not hide what they are but revel in it.  Somewhere that humans can mingle. vampires can dine and all enjoy what the other has to offer can be found On the Edge."
3,"Rating 4 1/2 starsI received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated in any way.Brett Andrews has an apartment above his club.  And Lisa is waiting for him.  This is a great way to start off this story.  Leo is an old friend of Lisa&#8217;s that&#8217;s come to the club.  The ending will leave you wanting to read more about this trio and having more of the club experience.Kallysten feeds on her reader&#8217;s need for a sexy vampire &#8211; especially for those of us that are female.  She paints a great picture of what happens when new meets old.  There&#8217;s nothing dark or sinister about what this group has.  If you&#8217;ve never read this author before. why not try this series.  If you love sexy. erotic. vampire short stories you can&#8217;t go wrong by reading Kallysten.  She&#8217;s a great author that knows how to pack a lot in just a few pages.  She never disappoints her readers."
3,"The first book in the On the Edge series is a fast and erotic must read.Catering to humans and vampires at his new club. Brett Andrews thought he had it all including the beautiful vampire. Lisa.  When Lisa&#8217;s old lover shows up at the club. Brett begins to fear that he will lose her. but that&#8217;s not in Lisa or Leo&#8217;s plans at all.This short and fast smooth flowing plot is brought to life with vivid images. intense emotions. and strong compelling characters that grab the reader&#8217;s attention.  The author has created a fascinating world of vampires that captures the imagination and ensures that the reader wants to know more.  The frequent sex scenes are scorching hot with menage and anal sex and well written and sizzling with passion as well as emotion.This is an erotic serial paranormal race that is entertaining and engaging and takes place in the fascinating city of Haventown where humans tolerate vampires.  I can&#8217;t wait to read the next installment."
3,"Short and sweet. Kallysten sure likes to keep us guessing when it comes to her books. Just when she pulls you in and you want more more more. the story ends you are ready to grab the next one.This one is about Brett and Lisa. Lisa is a vampire and Brett is human. They have lived together and been together and run a nightclub together for the past 11 months. Brett love Lisa. that much is evident in this short story. But one night another vampire. one from Lisa's past shows up and has Brett guessing how Lisa really feels about him.Can't wait to grab the next installment of this one to see more of this lovely threesome."
3,"On the Edge will keep you on the edge of your seat as you read this hot story by Kallysten. On the Edge is a short story about a couple. where Brett is the owner of the On the Edge Club and has an apartment above the club with his silent partner Lisa.  Although the club is new in town. it is an instant success as humans and vampires gather to party together.Lisa. a vampire goes down to the club to party and feed. Leo. a vampire from her past appears and she brings him home to play with Brett and her.  Brett is surprised that he likes what the three of them do together. The next morning Leo isn't sure how Brett will feel but the surprise ending made this a perfect short story.  On the  Edge may be short but it is packed with emotion and lots of hot vampire sex.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review.  The views expressed in the review are my own."
3,"This is a short short story that I assume sets the scene for future stories and it does this really well. You get a good picture of the club and what it's like and who it's for. It  introduces the characters. We first meet Brett and Lisa and find out a bit about them and how they feel about one another and then Leo enters the mix. We find out Lisa and Leo have a past. The three spend the night together which manages to not just be hot but tender and loving as well. The story ends with their journey together beginning. It was well done. A good read."
3,"Brett Andrews has been living with and loving Lisa for almost a year.  He adores watching her stalk prey in which to feed when she goes to their club downstairs.  Tonight is no different. except Lisa brings her prey home and Brett finds out he is a vampire as well.Lisa adores Brett. more so than any other man in a very long time.  When she sees Leo at the club. she can't help but bring him upstairs.  Lisa has a plan. She knows Brett's secret desires and has one of her own.On the Edge kept me on the edge that is for sure. Delightfully erotic. I found Brett's attraction to Leo just downright arousing.  Lisa knew what she wanted and was not afraid to reach for her dreams.  M&eacute;nages are one of my favorite types of books to read and On the Edge was just the perfect read for me. Full of sensuality. it left me satisfied.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"Kallysten kept me involved throughout the book and I will definitely be looking for other books involving Bret and Lisa's Club &#34;On The Edge&#34; I enjoyed this initial meeting with the characters and hope to learn more about hem and the club.Bret and Lisa have been busy. opening a club. balancing their relationship and the fact that oh yeah she's a vampire who refuses to feed from him has helped keep things interesting. Leo might be exactly what they didn't know they needed but can Bret get past his jealousy issues to accept what Leo could possibly offer?Bret and Leo are both strong male characters and I loved the fact that Lisa can handle herself around them.  Of course being a Vampire helps. Leo is also a vampire and Lisa's former lover when he randomly shows up in Bret's club things get complicated the question is can Lisa handle this situation.I loved this story. although an incredibly short read it shows the depth I've come to expect from Kallysten! More proof of why I love her!"
3,"I read this and felt the tears coming. How moving. I'm not certain if it was just me being overly emotional. but this book lead me to tear up and weep along with the stories.I've always imagined that I would be reached by loved ones and that they would send me the message that is necessary for my moment - a moment of encouragement. What a true blessing (and I don't use that b word much) for those to have received such a gift. Reading about it gives clarity. insight. and hope. so I can imagine that those who are actually touched by these events must be clearer about life and living."

I think myMother chose John 1. Because he has dark hair she always loved dark haired men. 2. For his kind trusting eyes they say the eyes are the Windows to the soul and his soul is the kindest.

You will be drooling over those features for the rest of your day!Enjoying The Show.....what more can i say.....where can i find a man like Mr Tool. Yes. you read that correctly. Mr Tool is the name the ladies of Abberwick Apartments have named there fantasy man and next door neighbor.Even though this book is only a short novel. it is soooooo worth reading. The story is entertaining. the characters are adorable. the humor is really funny and well you just need to buy it to see why it is sooooooo hot ummm.....good!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
3,"What a way to start the weekend!  Sexy Gage struts his 'stuff' for the girls to see.  Little did we know he was hoping Hailey would catch the show and fall for him.  He is a brave man to show it off just to get his girl.Hailey is so sweet.  I was glad to see a curvy woman be the center of attention. Lots of yummy sexy encounters while they work out their issues.Hailey and Gage figure it out with the help of family and friends. just the way it should be.Can't wait until the next brothers installment."
3,"Gage Warren harbors a serious crush for the sexy woman watching him. Hailey Jennison is the only reason he parades around his apartment once-a-week giving the women across the quad a show. He's asked around about her and knows she's infamous at turning down dates. Gage's desperation leads him to blackmail her into a date. He's sweet. but he's no charmer. Instead. his directness is a huge turn-on!Hailey has tried for years to get people to look past her playmate body to the capable woman -- with brains! -- within.  She's alienated herself with her standoffish attitude.  But once Gage comes into the picture. she completely blooms.It's a quick read. but so worth it!"
3,"Amy works way too hard as a lawyer and basically has no personal life.  The good side to her working so hard is always getting to see Justin. a man she's wanted for years.  Amy and Justin end up having to go to Hawaii to finalize a case they've been working on.  Little does Amy know that Justin has wanted her since the day he saw her.  While in Hawaii he intends to make his feelings known and give her one of her secret fantasies.The book wasn't very long. but it was very sweet.  There was a good relationship between Amy and Justin and very little drama.  Both characters were nice. had great chemistry. and seemed believable.  There wasn't a ton of information in the book either. but since the characters had known each other for years the way things happened in the book didn't seem unrealistic.  If you want a sweet. sexy story this is a good one that won't leave you feeling depressed."
3,"I loved curling up with this over the Holidays. Belle and Rafe are so cute together. They are a believable couple with all the family 'drama' wrapped up in the story. It had great character development. I think many women her age will see themselves in Belle. We all worked too much out of college and found it difficult to put family 'first' when we were starting out in our careers. Where was Rafe when I needed him?!?!? I also enjoyed an insight into the Portugese culture. especially around the holidays. I wish more authors would incorporate different cultures into their books. Love comes in many colors and cultures.Get some tea. your favorite quilt. and curl up with this book. you won't be disappointed!"
3,"What I Loved: Scott was such a delicious guy to read!  He was just the right amount of alpha vs vulnerable.  He was also YUMMY!  The fact that he was blind kind of made him that much more lovable.  Tara and Scott had a great chemistry that was fun to read.Complaint: The ending was way to abrupt!  It felt like a whole chapter was left out of the bookWhat makes this good Holiday read:  If you are looking for a short but naughty holiday read this may work for you.  It was about getting out of a bad situation into a good situation.  Just keep in mind the rather abrupt ending."
3,"What a disappointment. I thought it would be a nice Christmas romance. but it turned out to be disjointed. with underdeveloped characters. and an unrealistic storyline. The chemistry between the two characters wasn't even believable. but even that was ruined by the crude description of what develops between the two of them. It was like two teenagers in heat. I found myself wondering what happens in the end. there was no closure to the psycho ex- boyfriend. The content was lousy. Thank goodness this book was free. It was an hour read at best. with no real beginning. middle. or end. Major diservice to the visibly challeneged in that he's seen as weak and needy."
3,"I'll be honest..this isn't a 5 star book.  But it didn't deserve all the one star ratings out there and it doesn't deserve the average three star rating it has as of this posting.  I gave it a 5 to help even out the score.  There are some awful 1-3 star kindle books out there. and this just isn't one of them.  The book is kind of silly and FULL of ranchy sexy goodness.  The characters aren't annoying and the book is written well (not by a dyslexic monkey who may or may not be a fan-fic tween - like some books).Give it a shot.  I liked it enough to look up the other books in the series.  Maybe you will like it too."
3,"I'm totally in love with Lila Dubois and her Monsters in Hollywood series.  I grabbed this as a free read and am so glad I did! The second I finished this book I downloaded book 2. My Fair Monster!Clever premise. excellent writing. lovable characters and blistering hot sex!  I had to crank up the A/C!The main romantic characters. Michael the monster and Lena the hollywood power player. come through an amazing journey in a short time but it just works.  It's not rushed as some books would have main characters go from strangers to engaged in sixty seconds.  You feel his worry over her acceptance of his monster form. her struggle to love all parts of him. and the obstacles in their way.  The timing of their acceptance of each other and their emotions is perfect.  The dialogue was great. the stories behind their names - hilarious!  The monsters sneaking into homes to watch movies of humans is wonderful.Don't miss this book or this series!"
3,"Prequel to the series. this is more short story than anything else. Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely. This is something of the set up for the rest of the books. In fact. you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter's trademark. Don't look for depth- just desperation and passion. It is more of an experience than a story. It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series. you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books. This is one of my favorite series- hot. sensual. dark & dangerous. This story is more of an aside. like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe."
3,"I got one book. for free from my libary (# 3) so at that time I did not even realize these were a series.  But I really enjoyed that one so I went back to start at the beginning with this book.  I don't think you have to read them in order. there is enough information that I did not feel lost reading them out of order.  I really liked the story of this first book. the characters were very endearing in my opinion. I hope this helps someone else enjoy a good series."
3,"So I actually started The Darkest Night first then realized this one was first so had to pause DN to read this one :PI liked this short. first look into the series. Kadence and Geryon were a heartbreaking but sweet tale. Although this story was very short and at times it seemed a little rushed. I loved the emotion behind this couples need for each other.The fact that they could forge that connection while in hell made it that much more potent.I never thought I'd like a half-beast man...oh. who am I kidding? I want aliens. vampires. Lykae. Gods and Demons at this point. Half-beasts actually seem tamed compared to that :pNow that I have the back story. I'm dying to go and finish Maddox. He was KILLING me. Ungh Violence. I'm coming back for ya baby!"
3,"There was NO basis for their love. He humiliated her in front of people who could have helped her cause and asked her for a night with him!!! She had been working for months to get where she was and he just wiped it all away. I know he fixed it but it was his mistake to fix. he was not being sweet about it because he caused the issue for NO reason!!! She forgave him the very next day and that night. they are MADLY in love and a marriage proposal is a day away!!! Ridiculous and unbelievable!!!"
3,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful. but she is strong. compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate. but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in. but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love. hate. romance and philanthropy."
3,"The inspiration for this book was sweet. however. by the second half of the book. it was unclear if the story was about the experience of Jack's near boat catastrophe or about the lost opportunity for love.  The tone of the writing sharply changed also. to the point that it would be believable that someone else wrote the last half.  The ending was sweet. yet predictable.  The story could have used some more background on the marital relationship of the main character and the children's relationship with their father.  They seemed too accepting of Jack.  Would have expected some resentment from the eldest daughter who had been named after her mom's true love."
3,"At times this was a really good story. at others it wasn't. But it sure was a worthwhile book. nevertheless.Sandra Mercer was surprised to find her daughter Carla wearing a letter sweater that Sandra knew belonged to the boy she'd once planned to marry. 30 years ago.  Carla's new boyfriend. Kevin. was the nephew of that man. Jack Dawson - and Jack had just moved back to town!  As the story continued. the things that had happened over those thirty years to both people. the reasons why things had happened as they did. all were made known.  Also. that Jack and Sandra still loved one another - but after all that time. it may not be possible to be together.  Especially because of a sailboat race. something Jack wanted to take part in. that turns so deadly that Jack and the crew may never return."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
3,"There is a love potion floating around the Ton and the males are droping out of their celibate states in record numbers. much to the dismay of the remaining few.Not quite believing the tale but secretly worried. Lord Vailmont sets out to discover the truth.The potion maker. Sylvia. has secrets to protect and a stepdaughter's season to finance. She has no time for Vailmont and everything to loose if he comes too close. Unfortunately. he is very attractive. Could her family spell book help her find a way to control her feelings ?This a a book about relunctant lovers. She does not want to love and he. definitively does not want to marry. The potion that even its maker think a fake. might have some magic in it after all. They are caught in their own games and secrets and love finds it way.This is light. funny. frothy reading."
3,"I've never been one to read any kind of romance novels. but since I got my kindle I've been perusing through different types of genres.  I have read several of her novellas. she is good for keeping you entertained.  Fast paced and spicy. they are not for someone who blushes easily.  I really like this one. I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters.  Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen. cuz some like it hot.  Haha."
3,"Erickson's characters are well-drawn for what they are and their feelings and actions drive the plot.  Switching perspective between the two main characters keeps the story moving forward at a comfortable pace and the sex scenes are wonderfully steamy.  In fact. I was listening to this novel on Kindle text-to-voice while driving and almost had to turn it off for being too distracting.My only note -- and this is minor -- is that the charity set up didn't make complete sense to me.  You can't set up a charity home to keep kids out of foster care -- it would just be foster care in a group setting.  It didn't really detract from the book -- it was just obvious that Erickson was looking for something to lend depth to the characters.I would certainly read Erickson's other novels."
3,"This short novella was in deed. a very H-O-T read! The characters were well developed for a short novella & the storyline & plot was quite interesting. Brittany and her two best friends had just won the lottery and Charlie is their financial advisor/planner. Brittany & Charlie have a passionate & hot interlude that leads to hot. scorching sex & plenty of them too ;) Brittany is an emotionally wounded heroine as evident by her past & Charlie is sexy Mr. Nice Guy where he helps break down Brittany's barriers. They are opposites. yet they are perfect for one another. This was definitely a super sexy read. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a hot erotica. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
3,"I have read a few of Karen Erickson's books previously and overall she's a pretty good writer. I enjoyed this book. but it wasn't something I was thinking about much after finishing it. Not a huge amount of depth to the heroine. I had some trouble relating to her with her need for useless spending. but she did have great chemistry with the hero and I liked that there wasn't a huge 'end of the relationship' moment like many romances. rather the characters progressed in their relationship without tons of drama. Overall a good read and I would read this author again. the rest of the series would be worth checking out also."
3,"I don't have a problem with sex scenes. even explicit ones.  I like them when there is also a story where to place them.  In this book there is sex and more sex and the story is not present at all. at least in the first half that was all I could read.  I was hoping for more substance and that is what kept me reading.  But there was only sex for sex sakes.  If you like erotica with a bit of a story then this is for you but if what you like is romance with sex in it then I don't think that you would like this book."
3,"The story premise was cute. Hunky editor 'tricks' his prized writer into learning more about his desires. She thinks he's too hot to be interested. He's decided to go for broke to show her what she means to him. And. he's trying to bring her out of her funk after her cat died and show her that she CAN let someone get close enough for her to love. A handy snowstorm comes along to trap them together. It was very erotic. as the title suggests. Good. hot. short read. I will have to find more from Mari Carr."
3,"The story idea was sweet. with a hunky editor who is trying to convince his prized writer to start writing erotic novels.  Given that this is a new genre for her. they engage in a little erotic research under the premise of helping her writing.  I liked the characters and the scenarios. but I expected a bit more eroticism and a little less sweet.  It seemed as though the sex scenes were a bit on the vanilla side compared to other books in this genre.  Still. a light and entertaining read."
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
3,"Wow! out of the chute action. romance and one Hot Outlaw named Cal Ryker!***************This is a follow up from RIDING WEST (believe me when I say it means Celia was 'hehehe...riding Parker West!'..not the compas direction..) I suggest ya'all read that one first!Cal is one dreamy Cowboy. with a quick draw and a reputation that sets the other 6 members of the train robbing gang to thinking twice before denying his offer to trade his share of the take for the woman they took hostage. Cal's original plan to just keep Laurel safe until he can return her to her family. goes awry when they find themselves alone for 2 weeks!.......(2 steamy weeks)What starts out as a hasty rescue winds up as more of a heartfelt romantic tale complete with smart. sassy and sexy dialogue as only Emma can conjur. This is one short tale that packs alot of romantic pillow talk and honest character development that will make you 'sigh' and beg Emma for more. more. more of those West/Evans's stories."
3,"I very much enjoyed. It was sensual. and romantic.. Cal and Laurel were wonderfly done. I cheered for her through the entire story. A bit of mystery and a lost sole finding home. I could almost hear the wind in the trees. Miss Wildes painted such vivid pictures with her words.Will add Miss Wildes to my authors to watch.Storyline: outlaw romanceIntimacy: sensual. but not eroticEnjoyment: read with out stopping. did not want to stop for dinner.Book length: 41.000 wordsKindle length: na read in ePub format"
3,"Can't get much better than this!! Cal is the ultimate Alpha. and Laurel is a very likable 'Damsel in Distress'. One of my favorite Romance themes is where the Hero denies his feelings from the get go and I love to see them fall under the lady's spell. Emma Wildes does it great!! I loved the first book in this series 'Riding West' and I really hope to see more as soon as possible. Wildes has a way of taking you back to this time period effortlessly and the LOL moments are something I greatly appreciate(not to mention. the STEAM FACTOR).Pick this fun. sexy and suspenseful read up!! you won't be disappointed!"
3,"Others are more comprehensively detailed--A Night To Remember comes to mind--but this book. first printed in 1912. is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN.  It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers. the ship. the wreck.  It's one of the more human of accounts. and. paradoxically. one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time.  A must-have curiousity for Titanic students."
3,"The book. originally written just after the sinking of the Titanic. reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was published. especially with regard to the distinct roles of men and women. Obviously bereft of the insights derived from the discovery of the Titanic. it nevertheless raises two provocative issues: a fire in the coal bunker and unruly passengers being shot. However. I wish to clarify the matter of pictures which the mixing of reviews for two different editions has created.  The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted. but it DOES have photographs. The decision. therefore. is whether the inclusion of the photos is worth spending a dollar rather than getting the text for free. I think the photos. while not spectacular. greatly enhance the presentation and would therefore recommend the MacMay edition."
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
3,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However. there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK. the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in 'Man of Steel.'"
3,"I thought this would be a great book after reading the description.  But. the author has put way too much filler in and that just turned me off. There are also lots of misinformation as to how things work out. For example:  He ambled!  Her senses hummed.  Women don't growl in dismay. they likely would sign or moan. Men don't glide. cattle bawl. they don't bray.  Mules and donkey bray!  And on and on.  I think the author had a good idea for a story. but she just had a first novel or juvenile attempt at this one. I got it free and I am happy at that.  Cannot recommend it.  Explicit sex is also a turn off."
3,"During the wholes series I was and I am a fan of DJ. I love the way she treats her friends and helps them. Even love her bad habbits :-).What I did not like was the way this story was going. Quinn isn't able to stand a woman. who is standing on her own feet and not fearing to fight for herself? Does he really need to make her small to fell great. feel like a man?For me this book is pushed high. You must know Susan Mallory offers her readers in the US free books 14 days before publishing and they have to write a review to be in the next round for a free book."
3,"Up until the point where the author wrote that the Pope Pius XII and the Catholic Church did nothing to help the Jews. the story was engrossing. However. the author didn't do his research well or he would have learned the truth. The black legend that said that the Pope did nothing to help the Jews may be the 20th century's most enduring lie. Historical documents prove that he did whatever he could to save them. His dilemma was how does he speak out without further endangering the Jews. He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries. Hundreds of priests went to the death camps for speaking out against Hitler.I. a Jewish woman. gave this book one star because of this major flaw."
3,"This was a great read.... spellbinding accounts of the Jewish resistance to the murderous tyranny of Nazi Germany during Hitler's reign of terror..... I'd love to say it was encouraging but instead the accounts are real-'ish' ( I did think it was a true story at first..... turns out it is supposedly based on accounts... I will be wanting to research some now!) and stories that need to be told often enough that we never forget what happened to over 6 million people while the world did nothing.My only downside was the 'intimate scene' relayed on two occasions..... I would have liked for a younger audience to be able to read it and not have to get through those..... these are definitely stories that need to be told to a new generation.... other Holocaust writers have done this well..."
3,"Why ruin a good book with sex scenes?This was a hard book to read. but that was to be expected- it's very depressing subject matter.  It was well handled. though. fairly well written for the most part. I would give it a 3 or 4 star rating. if it wasn't for the 2 sex bits. They didn't fit the rest of the story. and pulled me out of it completely. Unnecessary. ill-suited to the story. If not for that. this would have been a good story from a unique viewpoint."
3,"At first. I didn't know what to expect from this book.  I thought it would be your typical survivor story but I was so wrong.  This is a book that had me sad one minute and cheering the next.  I'm not going to lie. at times it was hard to read--this is a very heavy subject. There were some very intense scenes that shocked me. especially because they really happened.  It's so hard to imagine living a life like this.  I wish it is was a work fiction and that this wasn't a real part of our history."
3,"Okay so this book literally goes one paragraph in the present. then a flashback. present for a bit. flashback. It was so annoying. I felt so disconnected to the characters. I ended up rushing through because it was so annoying. I would not recommend this book. The hero constantly says he just feels lust for his WIFE. He talks about how he cannot let himself feels anything else. It is your WIFE. you are MARRIED. you can feel love for your wife you stupid anti-hero!!!! It was so aggravating. Then she walks out and he does not come after her but one word and a crook of the finger and there she goes running to him. It was just a pathetic excuse for a book and really. writing in general."
3,"Love. love. love this book. The author did a wonderful job writing this story. I think the three of them are perfect together. There will be funny moments that  will make you laugh. I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already. I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author. Her latest update to this story 'ever after' was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book. Can't wait to see Paige McKellan next book."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
3,"When she was young. Rachel's aunt entertained her with fanciful tales of people who could change their form at will. Now. years later. she discovers those tales are shockingly real. And if she isn't surprised enough about that. her aunt's final will instructs her to find her OWN inner beast. discover the lost totem that will protect the town and all its inhabitants. and to mate with her dazzlingly sexy protector. Burke.For a novella. the story and characters are remarkably well-developed. It's just the right length for someone who doesn't have much time on their hands to read before going to sleep at night to induce some very vivid dreams. There are some questions left unanswered in Rachel's Totem. but. fortunately. the other novels in the Cougar Falls series will clear them right up."
3,"***spoilers alerts***The writing was easy enough to get through and was not dragged on and on by overly descriptive scenery. The town. its people were interesting. but as a reader you hardly had time to get to know anyone. Though I wanted to fall in love with the hot Burke. I felt like he wasn't macho enough to mark HIS mate on his own. That's the only conclusion I could think of that required his brothers' involvement in marking Rachel by them all. And after having told her sex wasn't required to mark her.Though the love scenes were hot. I found the fact that he shared her with his brothers distasteful. Not my thing. The only reason I'd consider reading another book of the series is because I'm curious about the other types of shifters."
3,"Frankly I read 2nd book in the series (In plain sight) first and loved it.  Then I  picked up Rachel's totem and it was such a dissapointment. Some parts were completly absurd and . really. immature and crude. I also did not like 4some. We are talking about mates who mate for life. And then f/m/m/m sex scene comes in.and for those who say it was really necesery in this storyline. then 1st. I dont think it was (think of Maggie) and 2nd. this storyline was author's imagination. It just did not fit into 'mating for life' scenario.After 1st book (In plain sight) I added the 3rd book of the series into my must-buy-when-it-comes-out-list but now Im thinking of crossing it off."
3,"Rachel has come back to Cougar Falls in search of a new beginning. The legacy from her beloved Aunt Charlotte couldn't have come at a more fitting time.Burke Chastell just wants Rachel to collect her inheritance and sell him the land so they can find the totem that protects Cougar Falls before the rest of the world discovers not only that it exists. but all of its secrets.Rachel's Totem by Marie Harte is HOT!  I enjoyed this story more than expected. Since it is part of an ongoing series. I was afraid I would be lost and confused. but I wasn't. I had no problem following the story and motivations of the characters. There was an unexpected m&eacute;nage. but it was definitely a fun one. I will be checking out more of Ms. Harte's stories after this one.Elysiareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"I would say this book is a decent read.  Not stellar. but not trashy or annoying.  It is probably the best book in the series that I've read so far.  I'd say that while these have thusfar been entertaining (taking up time and diverting my mind). there really just doesn't seem to be too much going on.  At least this one had a bit of action.  Story was weak. and characters were somewhat predictable.  But not a bad read for &lt;$3."
3,"This is a well written short novella. It is very interesting how the whole city and its very particular characteristics are depicted with precise yet spare language.A lady arrives to Cougar Falls. a place that is not in the maps to inherit her aunt property. It turns out she also inherits the responsibility about the fate of the city. There is romance. some fights. a bit of suspense.There are some steamy scenes. f/m and and a lady with three brothers.The whole story is interesting. and the door to a series; it does work standalone. Good for a fast read."
3,"A town that does not appear in the maps. a missing totem that is needed to save it from outsiders and a love story between a sexy shapeshifter and a woman with special skills make it an entertaining read despite the characters being a bit flat for my taste.There are a couple of very sexy scenes including a hot threesome; I just wish the author  developed the relationship with Burke's brothers a bit more. because it ended when it was getting really good. but overall I think there is potential for the next books in this series."
3,"I enjoyed it. It was a superficial read which means there wasn't a ton of explanation of different things - like the town. why the alpha could stay an alpha even when he was not there. how easy it is to turn into a puma (why aren't there more of them then?). the heroine being fine with becoming a werepuma. the rushed mating process. etc.What sets this book apart is its humor. I found myself chuckling very frequently at some really LOL moments. I must have a strange sense of humor because most books others consider funny don't even get me to crack a smile. Whatever. This series does.As for the plot and the characters - they are o.k.Bottom line: Sex was hot. dialogue was funny. characters were likable enough. I bought the rest of the series. At a less than three buck price tag they are more than worth it."
3,"Oh my god what can I possibly say about the beginning of this series?Absolutely ridiculous beyond belief. Did it have its redeeming points? Yes it had humor and was rather funny in some parts of the book but over all I am absolutely boggled by the way the characters just accept things. I mean seriously I understand this is a paranormal romance and has explicit naughty dirty sexy yumminess involved but I am expecting something to include with that. This one the characters just fall short of the mark. and are absolutely unrealistic in the way they take their situation with the amount of stride they take it into it. The plus size factor was enjoyable in the book but I find that it falls short of the mark again in how she only seemed to own it in her comfort with the validation from having a hot man on her shoulder.Yeah it was just another idea of the rest of the series. For the price it is entertaining but not worth more at all."
3,"This book was a waste of time and money. This book even at $3.85 was too short. It was listed at 114 pages but only 82 were actual story the last 40 pages were ads. The writing was pretty amaturish. The plot had promise but everything happened in a rush. The story took place in 2 days and when the 2 girls found out these men were werecats they were like really? that's cool. Very little reaction was shown to something that was really a pretty big life altering discovery. They didn't seem to care that these guys turned them into werecats. The explanation of the shifter world was glossed over not delved into. The heroine discovered her powers in a shazam moment. All of the learning about being a shifter happened off camera. Stated not shown. I was disappointed all around and the instances of cute dialog did not overcome the defects of little character or world development and absurdly easy acceptance of magical creatures."
3,"Likeable characters and engaging story but the way the main characters suddenly became mates was a little too fast for me.  I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com."
3,"This story is the beginning to a series and I really enjoyed it. The price point is about right for these short little stories so don't expect too much as this is very short. Dana Marie Bell has a new fan in me as the story moves right along. isn't too out there and I loved the domineering little Emma and how Max responds to her before even seeing her again. I thought the 'marking' her was a little abrupt. but I can look past that by saying that A) this is about shapeshifters and B)An Alpha gets what he wants when he wants it.Buy. Read. Enjoy."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
3,"Overall. I was absorbed in this story and the semi-abrupt ending has really left me for wanting more.  Don't get me wrong on the ending though.  It was abrupt only in the fact that I wanted to know more and there wasn't any.  I've already checked out Kaye's site and the only other novel listed is Angelic Avenger. which I don't believe is in this series.  I'm 99.9% sure of that one.  So. I'm going to be hoping there's more to this story in the future because I really want to know.  Definitely a great read for anyone looking for something new.For my full review. check out Literary Escapism."

Tiger by the Tail is a great summer read.Vivianreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"I bought this book without reading the reviews. Getting on here now. it seems that they all pretty much agreed with me. This was a fantastic story and sucked me right in. Then it just ended. It felt like I read the first third of the book and then found the rest of the pages ripped out.When you are raised as an outcast. what happens when you suddenly find yourself a queen of the people who banished your parents? Then how do you act when you find out that the last few rulers have all been murdered? Well. we don't really know because the story just ended before finishing the plot line!As much as I enjoyed the story. I would recommend waiting to see if there is a second one before reading it. If this story is going to be finished in a second book. I would definitely recommend it though.This was easy to read and the characters grab you. The only downfall was that it leaves you swinging in the breeze at the end."

Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
3,"Kasey and Garrett are twins who happen to be both gay and public figures. Garrett is an out gay actor and Kasey a basketball player who isn't ashamed of his sexuality but is hesitant about comming of for safety reasons.Gram is an openly gay club owner in the city the twins live in. Garrett frequents the club more often than Kasey does but Gram has a crush on Kasey.This is Kasey and Gram's story and it is a good one about find love and working to hold on to it even when it doesn't fit your 'ten year plan' to have it now.Kasey and Gram find ways to be together without to many problems and Gram is an amazing partner who respects Kasey's need to not be out to the world.A very good short story that delivers on many levels with some pretty hot sex scens"
3,"This book starts off a bit hesitantly--it's the first of a couple dealing with Kasey Johnson and his twin brother Garrett. but it heats up incredibly fast and in such a way as your initial reaction might be. &#34;um. whaaaaaaat?&#34;  Kasey is a second-year professional basketball player obviously playing for the Phoenix Suns--he's a 6'5&#34; blond god who is gay and has not come out. though his equally impressive brother. Garrett. a rising movie star. is openly gay.  There are so many &#34;this is absurd&#34; twists that this book takes which are dealt with brilliantly by author Chase that you actually believe that this stuff can happen. especially today.  You will not forget these characters. including Kasey's devoted seducer and eventually lover. Gram. and you will run right out and get its sequel. High Line. featuring Garrett. as soon as you finish this full court press."
3,"The beginning was very good. I liked the fact that Gram didn't know if Kasey was gay and he had all the worries of a teenager who doesn't know if he has a chance with his love interest or not. Their first kiss on the couch of a nightclub. stealing a moment in a dark. was beautiful and hot and sweet at the same time. It was a promise that wasn't really fulfilled.After that there's a lot of sex and the plot (young sport star who has to decide whether to stay in the closet and keep his endorsements or to come out and face the consequences with his teammates and fans) is lost in the bedroom. We don't really know the two characters and especially Gram is rather flat.There are no real problems in the book and it is a fast and hot read. but it seems incomplete and rushed at the end. like a collection of little episodes. but nothing really tying them together."
3,"Kasey Johnson is a professional basketball player.  His twin brother Garrett is a famous actor. They're both gay but Kasey isn't out.  Ingram Fletcher is the owner of Liverpool. a night club that Kasey and Garrett frequent. Gram has been secretly attracted to Kasey for a long time. Kasey likes Gram as well. but he can't come out to the public. Can one night of passion ever be anything more?Out of Bounds is a sweet romance with a lot of hot sex. Kasey is charming and Gram is sexy. They face prejudice and have to hide their relationship but they're stronger for it.  Out of Bounds is a good story.Nannettereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"Trite and repetitive - why do gay novels generally tend to be little more than a series of strung togther sex scenes with little narrative content ad even less literary value.  Come on guys we deserve better than this.  The theme of issues of being openly gay in sport is raised but the the novel closes before the consequences of being out are seen and the story developed.  Mills and Boon for gay men with sex included!  An hour's read at best with little characterisation or story outside the sex scenes."
3,"This latest from TA Chase is very sexy and hot. Vol 1 centers on Kasey a famed but closeted basketball star. who finds love with a much older nightclub owner.The story could have been more angsy if the writer so choose asit is never easy for a gay athlete to come out as he could lose all his fans and sponsors. But TA focuses more on the erotica side. the tauntings from fellow players. reporters more a side issue. And it works as this man writes the sex scenes so well. And it is rare to have a well over 6 feet basket ball player being 100% bottom even if an agressive bottom in a relationship. Interesting main and side characters and I look forward to more in this series."
3,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic. with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes. but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving. dangerous. and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story 'The Love of Sports Series. Book 2'."
3,"I wouldn't say that Crystal Jordan's 'Treasured' is a spanking novel.  I would say that this book is an erotic novel containing a lot of sex with a spanking or two thrown in for good measure.  That said I still really enjoyed this book.  The focus may not have been on spanking. but it was still a hot read.Becca was the perfect protagonist.  She was strong. independent. and could sword fight better than a man.  But when she and James were together. she was completely submissive.  Her loyalty to James was both sexy and endearing.If you are looking for a steamy novel to read. this one is perfect for you.  It is well written and keeps the reader engaged.  I only wish it had a few more spankings amidst all the spicy sex.Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview"
3,"I picked this book up to read in the evening. intention was to just 'start' it. But darn it. the beautifully written time travel pirate adventure had me glued to the spot -- a real Midnight Oil Burner! And can you say hot? HOT! This baby is smoking hot...pearls. that is different way to wear pearls. Just saying!  Yeah. if you like your sexy romps. and enjoy reading smut with time travel. then you're probably going to enjoy this as much as I did. And isn't that cover delicious? Oh. my."
3,"The negative reviews were leaning me towards not reading this book. After reading it it's not that bad it's just another case of different strokes for different folks. Rebecca travels through time to 1715 to James who is a pirate. while the other Rebecca originally from 1715 travel to the present. There was a little action as well as good loving between Rebecca and James. the original Rebecca from 1715 was a meanie to everyone around her so when the Rebecca who came from the present was around everyone they saw this change of a nice Rebecca so that lead James to wonder about the new Rebecca. Hope I'm not confusing. But it wasn't that bad. Now even though I liked the story it was ok it's not a Wow story but an ok."
3,"This book started off interestingly enough. which is why I gave it 2 1/2 stars. but it quickly turned into just your below average romance novel.  It never explained the correlation between Joe and the test dummy. or why these bizarre events took place.The book was too short and didn't give enough detail about the characters and the ending was way too pat. like she just wrapped it up quickly because she was out of things to say.I think this writer has some talent. which is another reason for 2 1/2 stars. but the story needs to be fleshed out further next time.This book was nicely formatted for the Kindle."
3,"This book was WAY too short for the storyline (yeah. usually I complain about the opposite too). The plot was intriguing. interesting and very different - and let's face it. a lot of books out there are just a constant rehash. There were so many different ways the author could have taken it. but it ended so quickly. I wonder why she chose to not delve deeper into the characters and flesh out the plot? This book could have been absolutely fabulous. instead it feels like an unfinished book. I give it 4 stars for the great book idea alone. I hope the author decides to do something else with this idea or maybe build off of what she has here."
3,"It is now $2.00 at Amazon.And it is only 2137 locations.'Lost in a reality only he and Anna inhabit. Joe finds himself falling in love with his intended victim. and ultimately fighting to save her life-because whoever hired him still wants her dead.'and'Warning: This title contains explicit sex. occasional bad language and extreme violence perpetrated against crash test dummies.'I liked the SciFi premise. The story was actually shorter than 2137 locations.  There was a lot of explicit sex for the length of the work.But a fun read.  Don't bother though if you have a problem with the explicit sex."
3,"I got this book for my Kindle free; after reading I'm really glad I didn't pay anything for it. The storyline had the potential for a good 'Twilight Zone' kind of story. but was just too lightweight to make it. The author seems to feel the need to put in really XX rated sex scenes - she seemed to love to be able to use the word c**k. I didn't find this adding anything to the story. and only finished it because it's a fairly short book."
3,"I love this book.The writing is fresh. the humor sneaky and the plot is nothing like a standard old paranormal. My only complaint is I wish it was longer. but Treanor does manage to make me care about Anna and Joe. I don't have a problem with an assassin hero in this. and even better Joe never turns into a typical domesticated reformed man--he keeps his edge of danger.I thought I'd be squicked because. hey. she lusts after a crash test dummy .... but the heat works really well.After I read it. Marie Treanor went on my autobuy list and she hasn't disappointed me yet."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
3,"My title says it all.  I was glad I was able to download it for free. I would have liked to see the h not cave in so quickly. she just melted at the drop of a hat when the H's were around.  She had legitimate gripes and didn't hold fast to her convictions.  I do like Maya Banks as an author and will not stop this book from reading others this however was somewhat a disapointment. A side note: I felt bringing a future child into this story kept me from enjoying it more.  I tend to get lost in the fiction and once a pregnancy was mentioned I tended to start to troubleshoot the arrival of an infant into this non-traditional household.  That's just me though.  Enjoy"
3,"this book is very touching as in you knew that deep down that the charcters loved each other. no matter what because overall love conquers all in the end. I wished the males could have been detailed more of their back ground but all in all good book. idk it felt like it was missing something from somewhere but maybe thats just me. it started from a different place especially of this kind genre. which i liked alot. like some of the others wrote you don't really read about the ups and downs during arelationship over the years. all in all good book"
3,"My husband is a workaholic with his own business like Logan and Rhys so I so understood the hurt the leading lady felt in feeling like your husband is married to the job instead of you.  I love how Maya shows the struggles and the rewards that are the roller coaster of life and that sometimes a woman has to stop being a doormat and make hard choices in order to be truely happy.  Let me also just add that this book has some of the hotest and raw menage love scenes that I have read before or since.  I read this book months ago and the images haven't faded in the least which is why Maya Banks is one of my top 5 favorite authors!!"
3,"SPOILERS!Mostly sex scenes with a few scenes mixed in. When she was in the hospital. why she didnt have them call her husbands secretary? She seems to always be able to contact them. yet we are supposed to believe that the heroine would only try their cellphones?And why suddenly did she act like it was ALL her fault?Also. why did they act like this deal could make or ruin their career. and yet they risk their marriage by leaving her. acting like they need this for their business to survive. They didnt even get the deal! They just gave it up after two days trying. why didnt they do that before???After losing this deal their business wasnt even affected as they hired new people. and expanded their business. I know im supposed to suspend belief. but it frustrates me that they made such a big deal about nothing."
3,"I loved this short story. Morgan has wanted her boss for a year but since she's the original tomboy/girl next door. she hasn't been able to get up the courage to let him know she's interested. Finally she decides to dress the part and it really works.The plot was good. the action is fast and furious and there really is a story. The entire story happens within a few hours but it's well paced and well written and above all the price is right!  I like Ms. Jacobs!"
3,"Very FAST! It was good and I felt bad that she had to go through that alone because he gave her a false name. I do like how their feelings never changed even though she is more cautious because of how he left and never got in touch. I do think he was faithful to her based on how he says his personal life suffered majorly because he was a workaholic and how every moment that he had away from work was filled with thinking of her. She was faithful to him because she had a son and never dated. I like when the hero and heroine only wants the other especially in this book because they both knew they had a once in a lifetime spark with the other. It was cute and fun and I was happy that he took the blame for them being apart and did not try to give blame to her for keeping his son from him like so many other heroes do even if the heroine did not know his real name."
3,"I would not say I liked or disliked this story. I don't mind a real short one once in a while. but it is really difficult with romance because I really want more character development and more time to understand their relationship. I liked the hero and heroine. but I think I am going to stick to the regular length romance. They are still a short read. between 4 and 5 hours. but the characters are so much more developed. I can't complain though as it only cost 99 cents."
3,"Four years ago Garrett Winslow and Haley Turner had a hot and heavy affair in Mexico. A tragedy took him away and he never looked back. Unfortunately. when Haley went looking for the man she fell for in Mexico she couldn't find him because he gave her a false name. Garrett has always been wary of false affections because of his wealth but he has never felt that wonderful true feeling he shared with Haley in Mexico. Now they meet again and he discovers that he left her with more than just a good time. Can he win her heart once again?The Billionaire's Baby is a short and sweet romance that is plump with emotion. Leanne Banks packs this novella with tons of heat and heart! I love Haley's stubborn nature and Garrett's relentlessness. They make a gorgeous couple and the plot is swift and endearing.Reviewed by MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"The story is short and enjoyable. Because of the length. time moves quickly. a few days covered by a few sentances to briefly explain what happened. feelings. throughts. While short. the writer has done a wonderful job with emotions. with showing how the characters changed over the four years from first meeting to finding each other again. Touching concerns. fears. wants and hope. very nicely done.Think of it as a condensed story without a lot of the fluff that is put into stories to pad the pages. The good base is there. but alot little things that would add length are not. For me. this was great. really enjoyable. I can see where others might not like it though."

3,"I do not write reviews as often as I should. however. after attempting to read this bundle. I had to review.  I have never read anything that contained more adjectives than these books.  It was absolutely unbearable. I could tell that this author had writing talent.  The story flowed well and made sense.  I found myself scanning more than reading because I couldn't deal with the overly flowery writing style.  If that type of writing is not your style. you will want to skip these books.  Following is a small example of the nonstop adjective use in these books...A bitter mountain breeze wrapped around his long frame. whipping his shaggy hair against the furrowed ridges of his brow as Jeremy Burns hiked through the Maryland forest. Like a wrathful banshee. the relentless autumn winds howled with fury. while his fellow Bloodrunner. Cian Hennessey. quietly kept pace at his side.arrrggghhhAfter reading authors like JR Ward. this type of stuff made my eyeballs roll to the back of my head."
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby . I noticed&#34; smooth line.  Rhyannon Byrd does at up just right for this one and has me convinced. I hope to read more of her books. I enjoy her style. Keep up the good work"
3,"The first concern with the paranormal romance genre is whether it is believable enough.  Could I suspend my disbelief?  Yep.  Worked for me.  I liked haveing the bundle because I plowed through these pretty fast.  Each book centers around a man who for genetic and psychological reasons is outcast but loyal.  So... this could take place in Medieval times. a police force. or on a ranch.  The conflicts and the subtle character traits are the best part.  I also like that the danger and mystery element held up.  Sometimes its just a way to get the characters in bed.  Oh. there's that too. but the human element and the well-painted scenery makes these wolves &#34;real.&#34;"
3,"The three stories were page turning. exciting. romantic and scintillating even though a bit predictable at times BUT the Jeremy and Jillian's story was the BEST!!! I Expected a little more WOLF action in the stories though. However. it was indeed Enjoyable reading.I also read Dark Wolf Rising and I am now reading Dark Wolf Running. I would love to read about the MOTHER of Eric. Eli and Elise to know her story and to find out if she had other children with her human husband and what her life is like EVEN a reunion with her children... BUT I swear if I read any of the following words again I will scream - Visceral. Guttural. Feral.... Ha ha ha!!!!Got to love Rhyannon's riveting expressions.... &#34;stroking her senses with that deep velvet-rough voice.....&#34;"
3,"Some editing issues and odd word usage... also a little contrived and heavy handed in spots.That said. despited a feeling of redundancy. I very much enjoyed this bundle as well as the fourth book. Dark Wolf Rising.HOT! HOT! HOT! Even if most of it is all tease! lolThese stories definitely got my motor running.I liked the characters. and the sub-plot running throughout the four books (though it was less of a factor in the fourth book.)The resistance/aversion push/pull is an effective device but I would have liked a bit more variation. One slightly annoying feature was how often a character decided to &#34;Go for it&#34; only to NOT go for it shortly thereafter.Still... I enjoyed them."
3,"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?  I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period.  The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to 'show' him.  I still thoroughly enjoyed the story very much."
3,"Many post apocalyptic stories are very grim. This one isn't. It has a lovely cast of characters. of beings who are trying to build new lives.The pace of the story is easy. like walk on the beach. The story starts with a wolf/human who is banished because the elders of his tribe are afraid of his ideas. On his journey he meets others: a young boy. an orphan and artist. whose body is damaged by the pollution of his former city and a female dolphin/siryn who has been helping the boy to survive and of course a very intelligent dog that they name Misschief.Many other new characters are slowly introduced.The book is infused with the love and healing power of nature. The characters are well defined and they all have a purpose. that they gradually discover."

He tells Stehvin his life story during the next couple of days. Meanwhile...... the story is fast paced. lots of new friends. and many adventures."
3,"I liked the premise behind the plot. mental attachment between wolf and man. as I like this type of interaction. Unfortunately. for me. the original promise of the plot never quite materialized and in fact ended up being chaotic for me with an unexpected side-step into shape shifting halfway through the book.For me. the book almost works well but doesn't quite make it. The plot premise didn't deliver quite what I anticipated. the characterization was a little predictable with secondary characters not well developed as individuals.I did finish the book but admit to skimming quite a lot of the last half. It wasn't a bad book. just not  my kind of read. Bland would probably be the best way to describe the book for me."
3,"Toni Blake is one of my favorite authors; great stories. well developed. likable characters. with some good sizzling sex scenes- they have always been a hit with me. This story is about Aunt Millie from 'Letters to a Secret Lover' it was very short. 35 pages. a cute. sweet read. It reminded me of the Grease era. Johnny with his ducktail hairdo and leather jacket- very reminiscent of Danny. Millie- the sheltered. virginal Sandy. The story is about how they meet and fall in love. Since it is so short. there wasn't much detail and over development. but it still worked- a good love at first sight story that takes 30 minutes to read."
3,"I thought that the hero was very annoying at first. He wanted the heroine and then went back to give his ex another try because he felt he owed it to her. The heroine then met his controlling. jack butt of a cousin when she was vulnerable from the hero and married him. A year later. her husband left with the heroine's money and best friend and the hero was no longer engaged to his ex. The hero could have saved them both a year of heart ache if he would have just stayed with the one who gave him the 'spark' he kept mentioning. but nope. he had to go back to the woman who was good for him in a robotic way. It was his fault entirely that she lost her 'fire' because his cousin drowned it out and she would never had went to the cousin if the hero did not reject her the next morning!!!"
3,"This author has written two really interesting characters with a nice supporting cast. The heroine is down-on-her-luck. but she's no week little victim. Girl's got backbone. Hero is an admirable military man. handsome. reliable. kind. an alpha without the macho. Two lonely hearts.This book sucked me in right away. ADORED the first half of this book. then it just became. predictable. and hokey. Dissapointed with the non-exsistent love scene. After the author built the sexual tension. I was left with no love scene just a morning after thought of their 'sweet loving'. Entertaining enough but it almost felt like two books. The first half tender. and deep. The second half corny and boring. Sorry not a keeper for me."
3,"The Jynx is the 4th novel I've read in my Kenneth C. Crowe marathon.  Once again I enjoyed the story.  A small bit of the supernatural does not deter me from awarding a well deserved 5 stars. A common man with somewhat uncommon intelligence seems to get into situations that can elevate him into  a life of celebrity  Crowe's protagonist is. once again. as in his other books. endowed with qualities that make him likable to this reader.  These are not serials.  Each stands on its own and the characters are fresh and exclusive.  I cannot identify a moral to this story. just as I can't say that there are no similarities with his other storylines; the ones I've read featuring a clean living protagonist whose politics lean a bit to the left and who are not adverse to a roll in the hay with a lusty female.  There's manipulation. greed. lies. and deceit. Jynx comes closest to &#34;he lived happily ever after&#34; ! ! !"

3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
3,"This is a brilliantly executed biography by a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust. He documents unimaginable horrors. He immigrated to Israel after the war. and later to the US. where he led a successful life. Had I know of this book when I taught high school history in San Diego. it would have been required reading. The book also provides an interesting history of the early settlement of Isreal. The comments by other readers regarding the poor formatting must have been fixed. I saw none and found the writing to be highly professional."
3,"I had not read a story of a survivor from Bialystok. Poland.  I had read previously read a story of a Rabbi from Bialystok. but he spent the war in Russia.  Therefore. this account was more descriptive of the cultural climate of the region.I am always amazed at how Holocaust victims survived the horrific events that were forced upon them.I will say that the formatting on the Kindle was not good.  If you are easily distracted by format issues. I would not recommend getting it on the Kindle."
3,"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII. I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save. I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust. but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost."
3,"this is a great short story about Ava and Luke. Ava is best friends with Luke's sister Jen and has been in love with him since high school but thinks he would never like her. Luke has wanted Ava just as long but neither has said anything. When the truth comes out about how they feel about each other there's no looking back. This is how a short story should be written the story line and pace worked great for this novella and though not long I cared about everyone in the book. The Ending of this book was great. I would defiantly read books from Anne Rainey again."
3,"This was a short but very hot read! I'm not going to write a plot summary here because. frankly. the story is so short that I'd be spoiling it by doing that. Suffice it to say that short stories don't always work for me. and this one did. Luke and Ava were very likable characters. and their falling in love was believable considering they'd known - and secretly lusted after - each other for 10 years. Oh. and the love scenes were sizzling hot! ;)Note: There was some light bondage but it was well done. so it didn't bother me. There was also mention of anal sex but it happens off the pages. so anyone who has a problem with that can easily skip those few lines."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
3,"Ava Sweet has had it.  She has wanted Luke McGiffin for her own since high school. When  she overhears him saying unpleasant things about her. she has something to prove.  She will make Luke want her and have him regretting his words.Will Ava get more than she bargained for?Forbidden Fruit is a great read.  Watching Luke come to terms with his feelings is wonderful.  Little did he know that a few overheard words would seal his fate.  I loved that Ava took up the challenge that Luke didn't even know he was putting out there.  Anne Rainey is always a treat to read and Forbidden Fruit is no exception.JambreaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"A little ho hum.  Joanna is a great heroine who really needs a break.  Aiden is her break.  He is a super nice guy but the I can never love again because I buried my heart with my first wife has been done to death.  He comes from a dream family with the exception of one brother who i assume will crop up in another book.  They're all kindness and light.  The good people from the church however are all mean and backstabbing.  Could someone explain to me why in all these Christian books the church goers are gossipy hags who have fun hurting peoples feelings.  Anyway it is nicely written and has some real charm going for it.  But don't expect originality."
3,"This is one of Jillian Harts better books in my opinion. It was a clean well written story that I enjoyed every bit of. The characters were strong and likable. I can not figure out why Ms. Hart feels compelled to write some of her stories filled with sexual description and others without. All of her stories are very interesting. why. then. does she feel she has to throw in the sex stuff that really. in my opinion. adds nothing to the story. in fact ruins it. Case in point. this book."
3,"I got this bundle from the library and knew there was a 4th book Tempting that I just bought and started reading. The first book in this book was sizzle which I was lost most of the time. I read fast and a lot waiting for kids at activities and I love fools gold by Susan Mallery so I kept with it then decided to look into it further and realized that I was reading the 3rd book first. I never usually do that as 90% you can tell and are lost.  I loved the series when I read them in the correct order and went back to read sizzle and it was so much better after reading the first 2 books. I have purchased and read lots of bundles and they are never out of order."
3,"Another amazing installment in the PsyCop series. I'm just going to get gushier and gushier in each review because I love each serving of this series that Jordan Castillo Price dishes out. I am fascinated by Vic and his history. and this book gave us yet another peek into what makes him tick. The characters are all so well developed that I can picture each and every one of them. and I feel like I know them personally.This book in particular kept me guessing and kept me on my toes. It was that delicious combination of sexiness. humor. mystery. and paranormal that lands right on my ultimate sweet spot. I am ignoring all of my books on my to-read shelf to plow through this series. This book was a bit meatier than the one before it and I have ridiculously high hopes for the next in the series."
3,"This one was my least favorite. I was so scared the author was gonna follow the same protocol of the cut and run series and ruin my life in the process.Jealousy and cheating are so not appealing to me. I have hated Crash since he first appeared exactly because of how much he threatens the whole story. And seeing Jacob doing what he did in this book made me hate him with a passion. I didn't think him and Crash were all that friendly towards each other anyway.Our Vic is acting like a brat too. trying to control other peoples lives. More specifically: Lisa. The infamous lisa who disappeared on us and now wants to be a part of the story once again. Make up your mind!The plot was pretty solid though just when I think I've seen creepy this writer shows something even creepier.And the boys are so busy with the new loft and work too. But going strong."
3,"Everyone today seems to be aware of the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz but only because of the film made in the 1930's starring Judy Garland. The film was fairly faithful to the story but differed in some ways. The entire collection of the Oz stories is a splendid read for today's children. All of the characters are amazing and some of the stories would make really exciting motion pictures with plenty of action and some really terrifying scenes. The book. Rinkitink in Oz. is one of these. It would make a great video game! I highly recommend these books to everyone. young and old. It was wonderful to read them all again and I am so glad to have this collection on my Kindle!"
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
3,"46.220 locations - 14 stories.  Active Table of Contents.  Just an incredible value.If you have a Kindle and like to read at all. and why do you have a Kindle if you don't want to read. I highly recommend giving this a try.  I don't recall what I paid for it. but it's 14 full stories about Oz by the original author.  Currently for less than a dollar.  I have to adjust the size down one for this book. compared to most others. but that is a tiny complaint.If all you know about Oz is the original movie. give this a try and find a more complicated world and characters then you thought.  Love the author's notes."
3,"Re-discovering all of Frank L Baum's 'Oz' books has been a hoot.  I read as many as I could get my hands on as a child; and so decided to check this one out on my new Kindel.  It's a lot of fun.  But no illustrations -- which are part of the fun of reading those books -- so that was a bit of a disappointment --  some misspelling and some dropped words from page to new page - but not so much that you cannot figure out what was supposed to be there.  I'd buy it in a hardcopy rather than Kindel edition. just to explore the illustrations (historical and fun in and of themselves)."
3,"Number of illustrations promised before purchase: 10Number of illustrations visible on my Kindle: 0Good part: the Table of Contents works for me.  I can go forward and back to next book (but not next chapter).Bad part: giant lump of text is tedious to read without any pictures.This edition includes the text of 14 books plus one bonus book: Wogglebug's adventures in the real world.  The Wogglebug book is dreadful and not worth reading.This edition is good if you have already read the Oz books and are re-reading them for your own pleasure (i.e. not reading them to someone else).  Otherwise. sorry. losing the pictures really takes away from the experience."
3,"I know that last part of my title sounds weird but it's true. Children will love the simplistic adventures of Dorothy and friends while fan of Tim Burton will wonder why he hasn't requested the rights to make these into movies. Baum imagination truly runs a little too wild at times.With characters such as a sawhorse made of wood. a glass kitten with pink brains (you can see them work!) and the Hungry Tiger who prefers the taste of babies but won't eat them because of his conscience you gotta wonder if Baum and Burton are related in any way.Either way. for only $0.99 it's worth your time.OH. but don't expect pictures! The description promises you illustrations but it's a lie. No illustrations were found in my copy. Just blank pages where they were supposed to be."
3,"I had never read any of the Oz books except the Wonderful WIzard of Oz.  I'd seen the Judy Garland movie several times and frankly gotten a little tired of it.  I'd seen a TV movie with new characters but had not realized there were further adventures actually written by Baum.  These are written for children but everything is so fresh and new they are great fun reads for adults. too.  I'm only part way through the entire collection but am having a great time following Dorothy's adventures in the different worlds.  Not all take place in Oz - so far. I've traveled to Ev (across the great desert from Oz) and a land underground inhabited by people who are vegetables and not particularly nice ones."
3,"the first time i got the books i got all 14 of them for free for my kindles but i kept mixing them up and had to use a cheat sheet to get them back in order. until i found this. i bought a copy for me then i bought one for my mom thinking she would read it. i dont mind that there are no pictures but it doesnt matter. when you read the books you make your own pictures in your mind to go along with the story. if you love the books and want to keep them in order then you should get this book. its less than $1 and worth it. there are 3 more books that you can get for free that tie into the Oz series. if you would like to know what they are i will let you know"
3,"Right and wrong are not always obvious. 'Vengeance' follows Owen Dunham. who is investigating the trail of a figure who is called the 'Grudge Ninja'. With little lead on the Ninja's motives. he is shocked when he does start to learn of the truths. and begins to doubt the integrity of his lead. The Grudge Ninja's methods may be wrong. but could its mission be right? 'Vengeance' is a thriller that dwells in shades of gray with many different characters with different motives and codes. highly recommended."
3,"Suspend belief and settle in for a fast read with this serial killer action/mystery that is relatively bloody/graphic and still manages to be entertaining with occasional touches of humor.It has to be the characterization that does it for me in this one as the storyline follows two serial killers out for vengeance against mob killers and the  agent in charge of the national task force to apprehend them and his wife.I tend to not identify with sadistic serial killers but in this case the author manages to tweak the plotline so the reader hopes they don't get caught. In some ways. it reminds me of the way Thomas Perry manages this with his contract killer in 'The Butcher's Boy'. Different premise and very different characters but all the same you know you shouldn't want them to get away. but you do.Definitely over the top but very well done and entertaining."
3,"When I read the book description. I thought this would be an interesting read. as a story about a married couple discovering their 'forbidden' desires and kinks is right up my alley. but when I opened the ebook and realized it was a short story. I had to lower my expectations. Still. I thought it could be good. because skilled authors can make almost anything work.Sadly. that wasn't the case here. The story's premise was never developed into anything resembling a plot. The book description was the whole story. or better. the setup for the sex scene where Roake's and Jenesta's hidden sexual needs were revealed. I've read and enjoyed stories like that (aka smut) before and I'm sure I'll read and enjoy others in the future. so why didn't I like this one? It all comes down to Roake and Jenesta. I'm afraid. I didn't 'connect' with them so I found myself indifferent to their sex scene and HEA."
3,"I bought this at the Samhain website (had a coupon from the RWA conference) and was extremely impressed. This was my first reading of this author and I thought she did a fantastic job for a short story. In fact I was just up here on Amazon looking for something else of hers to read and saw that this book has only a 3 star rating... shocked me into writing my own review!The other reviews have done a good job of recounting the plot here. so I'll just say that I think the story was very well written. dark and steamy with a nicely executed HEA. It stumbled a little bit at the black moment. but not enough to throw me off.If the story sounds intriguing to you. give it a shot. She's a wonderful writer."
3,"I read this book a few weeks ago and I guess I forgot to write a review.  Shame on me.  Anyway. I loved this book.  Hunter may have appeared to be a beast. however not because of his looks.  It was his beastly attitude. but I loved him anyway.  I was able to see behind the facade and so was Lila.  This was a modern days spin of Beauty and the Beast and Indecent Proposal.  I loved it. Eve Vaughn wove a wonderful story of two people with their own issues and demons who come together for selfish purposes only to find true love.  It was a definite page turner for me and I would most definitely recommend it.For those who are critical of the Hero's dominance. attitude and control over the heroine. I will only this....READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE BUYING THE BOOK....DUH IT TELLS YOU WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE STORY PLOT. WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED!!  Kudos Ms. Vaughn on a job well done!!"
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
3,"When I first started reading this romance. the guy in it seemed too superficial and uncaring to be interesting or likable. I guess that was part of his beast persona. because as I read further and learned more about him. he just seemed human and vulnerable.  I thought the author did a pretty good job of writing a modern Beauty and the Beast story.  It was nice too that the Beauty character in the story was a black woman with the beast being blonde. which makes a nice change from the cliche' ofblack men being with white blonde women.Of course Lila who was 'Beauty' was as beautiful inside as outside.  In the original fairy tale. the beast has a bad temper  as part of his curse. so having the 'beast' in this story be bad tempered goes along with that."
3,"This story was phenomenal.  I didn't know what to expect going into this story.  For some reason I thought this book was about something else. but in any event I loved it.  In a nutshell Lila agrees to be Hunters mistress in order to save her father's business.  Hunter propositions her because he had been disfigured due to an accident and doesn't think he can get female companionship without making them some type of deal.  Lila thinks she hates him because in order to save her father's business she has to bend to his will.  She's ashamed of her circumstances but can't deny she enjoys the things that he does to her body.  Hunter is always in control when it comes to there love making.  It's however and whenever he says.  The sex scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!  Hunter and Lila eventually fall in love and get their happily ever after. Definitely 5 stars!!!"
3,"PLOT: Lila's father is going to lose his business. Lila can tell the stress is affecting her father's health. So she goes off to confront the man who's responsible. Hunter takes one look at her and is immediately attracted. His mistress had just left him because of scars he sustained to his face in a car accident. Hunter proposes a deal. If she'll become his mistress for three months. he'll stop trying to ruin her father's business.PROS: Lila and Hunter are likable. Their chemistry is HOT. The author does a good job of developing these characters so that you really get to care about them. Excellent plot and story development will keep you hooked.CONS: None.5 STARS: Mistress to the Beast is a great romance. If you liked Beauty & the Beast. you're sure to enjoy this modern spin on the story."
3,"I gave this book three stars based solely on the fact that it was well written. meaning that grammar and spelling were on point and that the story flowed fairly well. But for me. I think basing this book on the Disney story of beauty and the beast was a bit juvenile. As were parts of the story. Things came to a head much too quickly for it to have been believable and the heroine going from. &#34;I hate this guy&#34; to &#34;well. I guess I can give him a chance&#34; was too much for me to take in. Overall. I thought this book was corny beyond belief and makes me wonder if other books the author has written as like this one. Honestly. the hero tells the heroine. &#34;teach me how to heal.&#34; Seriously?! It's a bit much to take."
3,"No love here. If you are looking for a quick tale of lust with LOTS of sexually explicit language. go for it! If you are like me and don't mind a good sex scene as long as it means something. than this book will be just as disappointing for you. It was a short book. author's writing style. not bad. Premise not so bad. but for me the lust never really evolved for me. Hero started out as a rich selfish bastard. and did not change enough for me. Not enough love or depth of character."
3,"I enjoyed this book.  I've read reviews on it where some said they were offended by the fact that 'a black woman could be sold to a white man'.  The story wasn't anything dirty like that.  And. that would be a fair argument if this wasn't a plot that has been used many times by writers with characters being the same race and. no one complained.  So. to those people I say don't read IR books if you're against IR relationships."
3,"I'm not fairy tales redux. but I thoroughly enjoyed this book and gobbled it up in one sitting. This was a great turn on the Beauty and the Beast plot.the sex scenes were hot and I actually like both the hero and the heroine.Don't get me wrong I wanted to slap the hero's face a time of four due to immature and often cruel behavior. but the author did such a great job with developing Hunter's character and weaving in his reasons for acting like a tyrant that I forgave him in pretty much the same vein as the heroine.  And he really redeemed himself at the end.Of course it was hard to stomach the heroine's self-sacrifice. but if she didn't then this book wouldn't have been a take on Beauty and the Beast.  So. I totally bought it and her not wanting to have sex with him but liking it because when she firsts meets him she's instantly attracted to him.This was another great read from Eve Vaughn."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
3,"Mistress to the Beast is one of my all time favorite books of any genre.Eve Vaughn created a tale that drew you in from the beginning. The relationship between Hunter and Lila is complicated and beautiful.  Even with Hunter's less than upstanding characteristics. you feel a sort of empathy for him and you want him to come out on top.  Lila provides the perfect contrast to Hunter's brute demeanor by being a loving. understanding partner.  And did I mention the love scenes?  HOT!!!!  I would recommend this book to any fan of ir/erotica."
3,"I have to admit. I figured this book was an erotic version of 'Beauty and the Beast'. but I was surprised that I enjoyed this story more than I thought I would.  Lila. a nurse. compromises herself in order to help her father keep his store.  Hunter is a very wealthy developer whose car accident has left him disfigured and often times cruel.  At first I had a hard time with Hunter.  I have to say. I'm not usually one for stories where the 'Hero' is more of a beast than man. but after reading this story. I realized that Hunter never knew true love. and was never really shown it. It was a little rough in the beginning. but I can't lie...the sex was HOT HOT HOT!! For something different. and if you can have an open mind. I think you would enjoy this story."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"Since I mostly listened rather than read the book. I have no complaint to make about the editing. Beyond that. however. was the absence of any sense of reality with regard to characters and situations. Without revealing specific situations to the person who will read the book. things happen which cannot possibly be the behavior of  Good Guys. other acts cannot be believed of any police force anywhere in the United States. and. the Bad Guys are caricatures with little credibility.Missed most is the absence of any depth in the characters. None are convincing as feature or even walk-on real people. Only two subordinate players are given any degree of life.The action itself is a confused mish-mash of tech-talk and violence with the Good Guys equipped with with super-gadgetry and the Bad Guys stand-ins from old Keystone Cops routines.No doubt it will please some who. in this instance. are prepared to be generous."
3,"I enjoyed this book.  It is not your typical adventure novel. since it takes place in Iowa and Nebraska (not your your typical hot spots of high adventure criminal activity) and the protagonists aren't special operators.  It is a fun read. and I hope Mr. O'Kane makes a series of it.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers. but I would recommend reading it - especially if you get it on a day it is free or you can get it for $0.99.  I love finding gems for those prices."
3,"This was one very good book.  It will draw you in. then it won't let you go until the problems have been resolved.  I will read more by Kevin O'Kane.  His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing.  Besides misspellings and incorrect usage. this one has many compound words written separately as two.  The pictures on the 'milk cartoons' was the last straw; 'milk cartoons' was referred to several times.  Spellcheck is not an editor.  Though I've become much more lenient over the years. constantly rereading a sentence to decipher it is sometimes intolerable.  This detracts from the flow of the unfolding events.  It is sad to ruin what otherwise is a great read."
3,"I have never read this author but I thoroughly enjoyed this story and would gladly read another.The disfigured Hero's fear. pain and pride were wonderfully described and I felt myself wanting to reach out and gently touch his scars to reassure him -at exactly the same times Aidan touched Warwick. Don't get me wrong. Warwick was a brutally strong hot male character-but we were so privy to his thoughts within this story that we began to get those protective feelings Aidan acquired. We saw the extremely handsome man Warwick really was.The passion and romace are well mixed with so much strengh and wit from both characters that sometimes you're not sure who the real Hero should be in this story.For everyone who likes the strong-take matters into her own hands Heroines--this is definately the book for you! She is a one WOMAN rescue squad that is the perfect match for our mysterious- masked hired guard Warwick. The sex between them is hot and wicked as well.enjoy!"
3,"This was a free kindle book that I got a couple of months ago. When I read the product description it didn't seemed like something I would like.  But I love to read different authors and genres. and I ended up surprised.  Don't normally like things that are in this setting - planets and space.  However. the setting doesn't impact the story at all - the only real mention is when they are traveling.The heroine. Aidan. is a pilot trying to help her degenerate brother. an addicted gambler. The hero. Warwick. is an enforcer with only vengeance keeping him going.The author set the two characters up well and the romance between them was well written.  This short story is a great jumping off point - I am looking forward to other installments in this series.  I am glad I took a chance and downloaded this book while it was free - otherwise I would have pass up a good read."
3,"I loved this title!  It's fun. sexy. very entertaining.The heroine is feisty. not falling all over the Hero. her own person.  She's not mooning over oh lover where art thou?  I like a no (or not too much) nonsense heroine that doesn't pout. cry over nothing. cringe. and otherwise wimp out.  She can give a punch and take a punch after all this is an adventure.  A tough cookie who doesn't mind enjoying one hot hunky guy without agonizing over it.The Hero is long suffering and on the heroine's side.  There are lots of bad guys and lots of double crossing.  It's just a good light read.  I did not think there was too much sex. it was appropriate to the story and relationship.  I happen to like space romances and this is a good one.I will read more of this writer."
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
3,"This book is apparently part of a trilogy(Red Hot Summer)that you can purchase all together. I am not fond of stories were the girl has to excessively chase the guy. but it was a nice change. and the guy did some chasing of his own in the end. The steamy scenes were hot enough and the emotion was there. but there was a lack of description about the characters features. I still don't know what color hair or eyes they had? It might have been in there but it was to quick and I missed it. Either way I still enjoyed this short story. Enjoy!"
3,"Shelby Harper is bakery and cafe owner near Naval base. Shelby has been flirting with Navy SEAL John Garrett(Garrett) for the past year. When Shelby over hears conversation between Garrett and Carson Scott that she might be a prude in the bedroom. She sets out to prove both of them wrong. When Shelby declares she wants a threesome with Garrett and Carson. they are floored yet Garrett is extremely nervous. Will Shelby prove them wrong? Will Garrett finally admit his feelings for Shelby? Your answers await you in Heat of the Moment.Out of Uniform Series starts out with a bang. Both Shelby and Garrett have liked each other for over a year but neither has made a move in the romance department. Shelby is sweet and smart and definitely knows what she wants~Garrett. Garrett is alpha male that needs a little push in the right direction but once there all bets are off. I look forward to continuing this series."
3,"Kennedy knew what she was doing when she sat down and wrote this book.  The character John Garrett is just super sexy and to pair him with his Navy SEAL buddy Carson. yummers!  Throw in a woman who overhears that these two men thinks she probably only has `vanilla sex' and you got yourself a steamy book. I don't want to give too much away about this book because it is a quick read but this book made me go out and purchase the rest of the Out of Uniform series that I didn't have.~BookWhisperer Reviewer MC~"
3,"This book really turns up the heat. If you can't handle or don't like books that involve sexual relations. then do not read this book. I really enjoyed this story. it was very interesting to read about. The romance part was pretty good. but I wish there was more. I know it's a novella. but I would have really liked to have seen more from it. There was more sexual aspects to the book than actual romance which I didn't like. Me having read book 2 first. book 2 had a lot more romance development in it. But overall. I did enjoy the story and it really brought some flaming heat! I can't wait to continue on with the series. because I love books dealing with military men :)"
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
3,"When you read Elle Kennedy. you know what you are getting. Fire-starting heat!  What a great way to start a series-- &#34;vanilla. sweet girl&#34; meets SEAL with a reputation for being a ladies man and rumors of kink and threesomes. They lust after each other for a year without the other knowing - and that's when the story begins.  Shelby proves she is not as vanilla and John Garrett thinks by having a threesome with Garrett and his buddy. Carson.Definitely a wonderful love story and the characters are beginning to be developed. I assume they will be in future books in the series. I will feel let down if they aren't.  The sex scenes and descriptions are NOT for the innocent- Elle Kennedy doesn't hold back! Hot!"
3,"Simon he may be the beta of the Pride but that boy is fierce when it comes to his woman. 'if I find yout that you had a hand in helping Livia hurt my mate I will kick your a** so hard you'll s*** out of your mouth after I have you cast out of the Pride. You understand me?' He's just a big kitty where Becky is concerned. 'Simon was purring. She ran her hands soothingly up and down his back. making him purr even louder. She bit her lip to keep from giggling.' The man has no shame when it comes to sharing a bathroom. 'he looks at her. confused. He pointed with the toothbrush. 'Toilet's right there. baby.' I'm excited for Adrian's book."
3,"So maybe I have read too many m&eacute;nage stories but this just story just did not work for me. I realize it is a short story so not a lot of character development or background but to me Cassie just came off as kinda whiny and wimpy....yes you're in love with your two best friends. and yes. you see them getting it on. you obviously were not that good of friends if you ran off with no explanation or confronting them about it (or maybe I am expecting the character to do what I would do which is call them on it...not that I have ever been in love with two people equally or at the same time....) so while I normally like this author this one just did not do it for me. I guess I like my heroines a bit stronger...."
3,"Too many menage stories seem to be kind of wish fulfillment. with the idea that the heroine is so desirable that she's irresistible.  There was a little of that here. but it wasn't overwhelming. and it was very much a love story.  I liked that the two men had clearly built themselves a life together. maybe not completely without regret. but with the idea that they were a couple.  This is nice after reading way too many stories where the male characters are forlornly waiting for a third to complete them. who is always your typical plucky modern heroine.  Usually with an abusive ex-husband.  One gets tired of that."
3,"I am not one to give bad reviews but I could not get into this book.  The sex was hot.  I am not too into m/m sex but in this book it wasn't bad.  you could actually feel for both men.  But Cassie's character I did not like.  She comes into town after being engaged for 10 months and within 5 mins is having sex with Kyle & she was pretty much the one making it happen.  I did not like all her self doubts.  I guess the last chapter was the best in the book.  So all & all it was an okay read but not happy I spent money on it."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
3,"Wow! I loved this novella so much. I bought the rest of Tuttle's books right away. The cover leads you to think these books are more Dresden Files (which I also LOVE to read). but don't let them fool you. Markhat is not Harry Dresden. I have loved Glen Cook's Garrett. PI books for years - eagerly awaiting every new one. Well. now there is able successor in Frank Tuttle's Markhat. A bit darker (what's not to love?). but just as lightly humorous with an interesting cast of fantasy characters living side by side with humans. No spoilers here - go buy the books yourself (make Tuttle some money. ok? He needs to buy more depilatory) and plan to read them all. one after the other. If you like gritty fantasy with a mystery. these books are for you. Frank Tuttle. get writing - we want more Markhat!"
3,"I've had this book since October 2011. It's now mid-March 2012. and I've only just read it today.I have to say. for the first page and a half. I really did wonder what I was reading. but very quickly the quirky writing and the tongue-in-cheek hunour took over. and I was caught!Trolls. Vampires. a man who finds things and a neighbour who is some sort of voodoo witch crossed with a look-out... This was great fun. Delighted to give this five stars. and hope that if you ever have a few hours and need a good short with no pretence of the irony and curious humour that fantasy can sometimes throw at you. this is a great place to start!"
3,"I loved this novella/short story.  I got 'Dead Man's Rain' first for free when it was offered for the Kindle. but I went to Frank Tuttle's website because I wanted to read his works in this series in order.  I got the sample and loved it and since it was only 2 dollars. I couldn't resist it.  Anyone who wants a slightly silly and fun trip through a world where mythological and fantasy creatures really exist alongside people. should read this bok because this is the book for you.  I would say it's even ok for children. at least this one. because there's nothing hugely graphic spelled out except for mention of blood and people getting hit.  I will start Dead Man's Rain shortly."
3,"Very. very funny. with the clever twist of having intelligent trolls that are a part of a functioning society.  My wife (whose Amazon account I am hacking since I do not have one of my own) starting downloading Tuttle's books on the Kindle and we are both in the process of flying through the entire catalogue.  This is one of the funnier books that I have read in a long time. set in a fantasy world that does not conform to the normal archetypes of the various creatures normally found in such worlds.  Get this story and enjoy it."
3,"As I wrote in my review of Frank Tuttle's other Markhat the finder work. Dead Man's Rain. I really enjoy reading about Markhat the detective and his crazy noir fantasy-world of trolls. half-dead vampires. sooth-sayers. and humans.  I got Dead Man's Rain for free but actually paid the $2 for this 'book' after finishing Rain and wanting more Markhat.  I put book in quotations because both stories are very. very short.  Adding to the vexation of getting to the end of a short piece of fiction and wanting more. the last 20% or so of the Kindle editions of both Markhat works consist of previews of other Samhain Publishing books which are not even written by Frank Tuttle.  This was very disappointing to say the least.Still. I would pay full price for a FULL-LENGTH Markhat book if it were available for the Kindle."
3,"So we get to learn more about markhat's past here. and it's a perfect past for him. Also one that had me reaching for the kleenex. thanks a bunch.The usual high quality writing. with a touch more personal stuff about the character. all very well written and perfectly suitable to the story. It can actually be very difficult to find things to say about very well-wrotten books. and that's the trouble I'm having now; there are no flaws to pick apart. no criticisims to be found. It's a solid short about an interesting character with well-done side characters and good imagery. So far. it's one of the best fantasy series I've read."
3,"I felt this story was too short. too short on character development. too short on descriptions. too short on what this guy actually did and what time period it was.  I know a lot of books don't ever tell you when they take place. but I kept wondering throughout.Why there were trolls and other creatures? What did they have to do with the story?  A lot of questions that were never answered.I had no problem with reading the book. and it is nicely formatted for the Kindle. I just think what makes a so-so book better is lush and full descriptions and making sure the reader knows about your characters.  I thought this book lacked those characteristics."
3,"Novella length urban fantasy along the lines of Butcher's Dresden.I like this authors style. It has such a devil may care attitude to it and that is exactly how he has written his main character. With the debonnaire flair of  an outcast gentleman and the sarcastic wit of a person who doesn't give a flying monkey what anyone says or thinks.A few minor errors. one being the use of the word reign instead of reins.Other than that this is quite an excellent read. just a shame it isn't a full length novel. Saying that though novellas often feel 'interrupted' for wont of a better word and this doesn't. it fits snugly and ends well. Like the first cup of coffee in the morning.It just feels right.AVP-UK"
3,"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions. curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter. more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect."
3,"As with The Mister Trophy. I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as 'haint'. which is a ghost.  I really love the characters. but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good. but short. fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."
3,"Disclaimer: I got this for my Kindle when it was being given away for free.  It now is up to $2.80 but my review takes into account what I paid.I like Markhat the finder. a hard-boiled ex-military gumshoe in a fantasy land where trolls. vampires. and other creatures of the night interact with humans.  This novella/short story has some great dialog and I truly wish it had been longer.  I even paid $2.00 for another Markhat book. The Mister Trophy. hoping for more of the same and while it was equally as good as this book it was also equally as short.  If I consider the combined content of both books and consider the $2 I paid for them. I still rate them 5 stars.Apparently there is a third. longer Markhat book out now which for some reason isn't available for the Kindle.  Come on Frank. what are you and Samhain waiting for?"
3,"This book was a surprise for me.  I have had it on my Kindle for awhile but the synopsis did not catch my interest.  I was going to archive it without reading it but decided to give it a fast cursory run through.  It caught and held my attention.  I finished it in one sitting.The butler and the protagonist were the most interesting characters.  During the storm the action was a little confusing but that did not detract from the over all read.  Being a teacher I just had to make note of grammatical/typo  errors.  There were no egregious errors that detracted from the story.Is it me or do the Kindle editions of books have more errors than the paperback/hardbound books?  I have wanted to literally compare a Kindle edition to the paperback version. Guess I am too cheap and/or too busy to do this.  One day I will summon up enough interest/motivation to do this experiment."
3,"'SPOILERS'I just got done reading all three books in the Vaughn series that are currently available and enjoyed all three of them.  My main issue with this one however is how quickly Candice gets over her experience of being raped...in one weekend she goes from barely being able to cope with talking to people at the gym. to sleeping with the hero...and it just seems as though it moves a bit too quickly...but the book was a good read and i'm eagerly awaiting the next one in the series due out early next year about their cousin Grace"
3,"This is the first book I've read by Ally Blue and it won't be the last. I enjoyed this story immensely even if it was on the light side. There was little to no background or buildup. but somehow it worked as a short story about two very sweet people. I like the heroes this author created. they were good and kind people. even though there were some fights and arguments. they worked things out. I was not a fan of the whole developer and corrupt city officials part of the story but luckily for me. that was only a brief part of the whole story. I enjoyed this very much and would recommend it to others as a hot. romantic MM read."
3,"It was an easy couple of hour read for me that was pleasant enough for a free book.  It's the same old story though. a young couple lose their lives leaving an orphaned child to a rich sibling to take care of.  It was just a bit sad at times all the references to the deceased couple but turned out HEA and the child very much loved. The author has a nice writing style. this is my second book by her and I'll be looking for other free ones.  Enjoy"
3,"I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason. he thought. but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read."
3,"By Gwen S. .San Marcos CA... We are finally reading  the tale about Anna G. . the third saga of the Women of Brambleberry House. Sage's and Julia's sagas were well written  with well developed characters  and story plots but in Soldier's Secret. I felt disconnected with Anna's personna so my interest in reading this book to its conclusion waned exponentially as I plodded through  it but I read it to the very end...I did! Max. Abigail's wounded veteran /nephew. on the other hand captured my sympathy as a recently wounded. helio-flying medic/ veteran in recovery phase. And Abigail. even in death. managed to get Anna and Max together as a couple with the help of Conan. the mutt. Anticlimatic story to the trilogy."
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
3,"I bought this set and returned it.  I couldn't force myself to finish the first book. A Touch of Silk.  ( They are bundled out of order. too).  The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!  But the pages and pages of supposedly erotic fantasy stuffing the book to bring up the word count was the final blow.  No character development. not enough background.  What should have been interesting read like a pre- teen fantasy.  Don't waste your money."
3,"This book was a little slow in the beginning. but once the killing started. I had a hard time putting it down.  The kindle edition is a little rough due to some formatting problems. but it was definitely readable.  Williams does a great job with character definition and more than makes up for what the book lacks in plot.  The author's descriptions of violence are so well done that it is easy to visualize the gory details.  For fans of gratuitous violence. this book does not disappoint!"
3,"...with a twist of goth and one seriously bad serial killer!This book really held my interest all the way through. but then the ending came and went in a flash.  With so much build up. I would have thought the ending would take longer to complete itself - not so.The detail given to describe the setting of each scene was incredible.  Also. you were provided deep insight into the characters. even the lesser ones.  There was nothing vague about this book.Formatting was off. but it wasn't too distracting after a while."
3,"This book has a good basic storyline.  However. I found the writing to be of a rather jerky and staccato style. especially in the descriptive areas.  It was rather difficult to follow at times as it jumps around a bit and with the formatting problems (quite a few) I found myself trying to figure out where I was in the story. It took me longer to read than it should have because of that. Reformatting would definitely help you keep track of what is happening. I did feel that there were a few things that could have been left out of the story as they really weren't incorporated into the storyline very well. just seemed to be thrown in because you have to be explicit about some things (x-rated).  Thank goodness for the fast page turnings on the Kindle! Even with all this. I still wanted to keep reading to find out what happened."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
3,"This was an excellent. fast paced story that I didn't want to put down.There is a small issue with formatting that I almost deducted a star for. but I just couldn't do it as it did not hinder my reading much at all. It's only a matter of sentences dropping to a new line in the middle and not having page breaks between chapters.  Annoying. but not debilitating.The characters here are vivid and believable. The writing is succinct and graphic.This was a steal for $.99. I will definitely be watching out for more from this author."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
3,"There were a few things that I liked singularly in this story. especially the friend-to-lovers theme and the fact that Will. who is the quiet guy. had an unexpected dominant streak. but this fact was also what brought me out of the story a bit. because I see the book is tagged BDSM and I didn't really feel it as a theme of the book. There's also something that made me almost mad: Will's colleague is expecting him for dinner to set him up with her brother. he knows he has to go. but then he is caught up in his confrontation with Ethan and that fact is not mentioned anymore. I know one can't expect everything to be tied up. but what was the point? There was something good and intense in the story. but there was also something over-the-top and not deep enough. It's probably more 2.5*. but I liked Will a lot. so I'll bump it up a bit."
3,"I was completely hooked on this book from beginning to end.  The writing is excellent. the story well-told with depth of character. and description that doesn't leave you confused - but doesn't go on and on to the point of boring you.I honestly couldn't put it down except when forced. (funny how they think you ought to work at work. instead of reading... harrumph) and was constantly thinking about it when not reading.I was SO happy with the ending!  It wasn't utterly predictable. it wasn't too easy. and I felt like justice was served.  Beautiful combination. yes?I look forward to reading Collateral Damage by Austin Camacho. now.  Hannibal Jones is a guy to follow."
3,"I enjoyed this book so much!  Loved the main hero Hannibal Jones!  What an Alpha Male Hero!  I was so busy turning the pages that my poor husband had to do all the chores!  The suspense never let's up!  The action is well planned!  It is a taut. fast pace action thriller with just enough of romance interweaved!  I loved the fact that that the author. Mr Camacho. made Hannibal a very human hero. who wins a few and loses a few!  For fans of Action Thrillers this is a book well worth reading!  I am definitely a FAN!"
3,"Dragon Knights. Border Lair. Book 2 in the series. This book can be read alone. but is better if you start with the prequel The Dragon Healer or Book 1 Maiden Flight.  This book follows Belora's. Maiden Flight. mother Adora who has been reunited with her childhood friend and adopted mother Kelzy the dragon.  Adora finds love with her 2 Knights and there Dragon Partners.  The broad story line continues to unfold at a nice pace.  After reading this book. I was engaged enough in the story that I picked up the rest of the series to date. Keeper of the Flame."
3,"I really enjoyed this 2nd book of the Dragon Knight series. This picked up from where Maiden Flight ended and the transition was very well handled. The storyline of Belora's (Maiden Flight) mother. Adora finding love after she has been a widow for 10 years is wonderful particularly when the man she meets is also a widower who lost his family. The meddling of the dragons is cute and very astute.The only fault I found was the story of her lost twin daughters being told several times. yes. it did move the story forward but it could have been better condensed.The introduction of new characters was handled well and the enemy king and his plans was well thought out and a great plot twist.  Well done.... I'm on to the next book Ice Dragon - can't wait!"
3,"Another great read in this series. I absolutely loved the first one and had to have the second and I was not disappointed. If anything it had only hooked me on this series even more. I love the characters and how everything interacts and flows together. It's written really well and I'm able to just immerse myself in the story and the world that has been created and I don't want to leave. even when the book is done. There is plenty of action in this story to keep your attention.  Now to get the next one :)."
3,"Cade wants Mollie and wonders what she is doing marrying the jerk from high school. When Mollie catches her fiance not only putting her down but also cheating she decides she has her own brand of revenge have Cade bring out her inner bad girl. Cade agrees but what he really wants is more from Mollie he wants it all from her. The way these two tear up the sheets is smoking hot but the fact that neither of them know how much of the others heart is involved keeps you with it to see if they will figure it out. not bad for the price definitely worth the read"
3,"I keep buying these books. The last one(sweeter than wine) was a vast improvement. There was a story line! There was character development!! Finally one of the books has some meat!!! I was excited for the next installment! Then I read it.......and it fell flatter than a fifth graders training bra. Especially when I finished it in about 45 min. And we skip about 2 years. And we go from I love you. to vows. to babies. to a year later...in about 20 pages....c'mon bianca. youre better than this."
3,"CONSUMED showcases the ability of Moira McTark (aka Mira Lyn Kelly) to write realistic characters. VERY witty dialogue and STEAMY scenes.Amber Grayson has had a crush on Brian Matthers since high school.  Although they never got together. he represents her ideal man.  This story is about what happens when they meet on the train coming home from work.'So. what`s your stop?' he asked. smiling a little too platonically for her taste.''She said a silent prayer. begging the LUST FAIRIES to accost him at full throttle.''Taking a deep breath. he wondered how he was going to get through dinner without crawling under the table and pressing his face to her...'My one issue would be that the problems Amber has with Eric are resolved in a too simplistic fashion.If you enjoyed this novel. check out  WAKING UP MARRIED. ONCE IS NEVER ENOUGH. and THE S BEFORE EX."
3,"A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line. I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes. with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber. their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian. but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice. hot. hunky. hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?"
3,"It was okay but since it was neither of their faults that they were separated. the story was redundant. They said the same things over and over again. Plus. she says the dress she was wearing at one point was perfect for the summer day it was but it was set at Christmas time. Ms. Darcy needs a better editor. It also bugs me that the hero had been with other women but since he thought he was betrayed. I am not as upset by that then I would be if they were just apart for other reasons. I still like my couples to stay faithful to one another during their separations. He also told her he thought of her when he was with other women because they never made him feel what he felt with her. Ummm... is that supposed to be sweet??? It is not!!"
3,"After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the book. but was disappointed how quickly the heroine fell into her x-lovers arms.  His father was ruthless and even knowing his son was in love he set him up to destroy the relationship.  He didn't even know he had a son - after 6 years!!!  I will say that once he made the effort nothing - even his parents - stood in his way of restoring what he had lost out on - the first 5 years of his son's life."
3,"Nothing better than a rip roaring family stand-off to spice up weekend reading. Luc father. Maurizio is a dinosaur hell-bent on his version of Greek tradition being honoured. though he himself is far less honourable in his methods.Luc is gutted by his brother's  and father's betrayal of his love for Skye. not to mention the son they hid from him and comes in guns blazing to a blistering. scorching confrontation with Maurizio. And bluntly defies his family to woo back the love of his life and their son.Lots of layers to unpeel. more blistering showdowns for this family to work their way through. I love this alpha male. prepared to defy and dis-own his Greek family to put Skye and Matt first. And I love that Skye makes Luc earn the right to her trust and love but she also grows to understand the tenacious pride of culture and traditions. despite being far from home.Very satisfying - one of the few novels to survive another culling from my library."
3,"This book was great it doesnt seem like i could find words to describe how happy I am I bought this book.This book is very emotional it has it all. love. pain. sadness. fear. forgiveness and family.Love of not only of Luc and Skye. but love for family. of a mother to her child. love of siblings and love of tradition. Pain of betreyal is sompalpable in the beginning i honestly dont know how skye could forgive but i understood that her love for Luc was to great that she doesnt want him to loose anything. For me it was very couragious of her to face her fear of meeting Luc's father who caused her so much pain.I know this review is very criptic but i want u guys to read it. It very worth it."
3,"It was a happy ending. He messed up and he groveled a bit for her. He knew what he had done was hurtful to her and he had to build up her trust. I was satisfied with the effort he made to win her back. This is not a cheating book but a family that did not approve of his love for her. so they got rid of her. A deathbed confession and I was hooked. I was just going to read a chapter and go to sleep but finished the book."
3,"Luc believed some photos that showed his mistress in a very compromising position with his own brother.  He then got rid of her believing family over her.  Six years later he discovers that his brother lied and that his own father put him up to it.  He then throws himself full throttle in to getting Skye back.  Believing her in all things and questioning his own father.  Very nice story about forgiveness and getting past preconceived notions of another.  The characters were well drawn but I suppose there was a question to get past though.  If Luc believed that his own brother would betray him like that why did he continue to get along with him?  Why did he continue to have a relationship with him but toss Skye out to the street?  The only thing that makes since is that Roberto was his brother and he could forgive him but not Skye.  Yet one would think that is a line that a BROTHER should never cross!! (therefore the reason for 4 stars)"
3,"I want to start by saying this is a great cover. Sexy man in heart underwear clearly highlighting his 'attributes' I mean what's not to like right. So without even cracking the cover it's off to a very promising start. The story is well paced. engaging and carries you seamlessly to the very last page. The relationship and interaction between the main charcters is natural. realistic and gets nice and steamy without dragging on too long in any one spot. I do wonder if anything will come of Suzanne and Stan seeing as there was mention of them meeting to discuss business and it stood out to me that maybe there could be more there?? Another book perhaps ;) In the end Lacy's adventurous side will balance out Gabe's more reserved side and they'll find their HEA. This was my first time reading Tori Scott and I'm definitly looking forward to reading her other books. cuz if there anything like this one I won't be disappointed!"
3,"I am a huge Debbie Macomber fan. there's not too many books of hers that I haven't read.  After saying that. her best writing. in my opinion is her Cedar Cove series.  With 12 books total. the books follow a cast of characters through life and hardships.  The series starts with 16 Lighthouse road and ends with 1225 Christmas Tree Lane.  It's easy to know where you are in the series based on the title - the first number in the title is the corresponding number in the series.  Debbie Macomber's characters draw you in and make you feel as though you are part of the plot and by the time you have finished the book(s) you feel as though some of the characters are you best friends as with Olivia and Grace.  You meet them in 16 Lighthouse Rd and 204 Rosewood.  If you download this book/series. you won't be sorry.  Curl up in your favorite reading chair and be transported to Cedar Cove.  Enjoy!"
3,"The Cedar Cove Series is written so anyone any age can enjoy the story.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest I could relate to many of the area references.  The story held my interest because there are so many stories going on at the same time.  Unfortunately the TV rendition changed a few of the events and personalities of the characters and that to me detracted from the book rendition.  I read all 6 books and enjoyed picking up the story each and every time I left off and resumed the books.  Good writing and story telling."
3,"Another great book in the cedar cove series. I know some were not as happy with this book as the others in the series. but I liked it. I like the new romance of Teri and chess player. Bobby.  It's a new twist for d. Macomber. Usually her characters are not celebs. And also chess is a different world entirely.  It's a great incorporation. I like catching up with past characters. I've come to love and the settling of story lines. It's a wonderful read. I can't wait to start 74. I hope you hop on board and enjoy a slice of happiness and dizziness."
3,"Boatman's got style and vision. The vast majority of the stories in GOD LAUGHS WHEN YOU DIE are wildly inventive and unpredictable. cleanly written and forceful. Some of them will make you a little... uncomfortable. While the subject matter is deadly serious. there's a strange undercurrent of bleak. bleak humor here as well. the kind of humor you cling to when faced with ugly truths that can't be denied.The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review was the somewhat messed-up formatting. But despite that. I'm looking forward to more from this author."
3,"I wasn't certain whether 4 or 5 stars were warranted for this book.  It's very well written. but the subject matter makes for a very emotional. hard read.  As a cat lover. I hated the premise of this book.  But. it's a subject that needs more exposure; torture in the name of research.  Just don't leave this book lying around for a child to get into; it's not a Disney- or Seuss-style read.  I read it several months ago. and it's still in my memory banks. occasionally assaulting me at unguarded moments."
3,"I have always had dogs and read dog books.  Recently got a kitten - turned big-boy cat and thought I might enjoy this book.  It was extremely difficult to read.  Almost caused me to have a panic attack.  If these things really go on out there - I guess I have been living under a rock.  A colleague was going to get it for his 9 year old daughter and I said NO  Not a book for kids to read.  I am hugging my big boy cat as I write this.  I will be on the lookout for any other Sisypuss vagabond cats out there from now on.AS BOB BARKER WOULD SAY:  SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PET (and anyone else's you can afford to)."
3,"This was the first effort by Mr. Skinner. It's a very simple. lovingly. sweet story about 2 lost souls that find each other. Their union brings a stability and happiness that each have lost. Brock's life is rocked by scandal and Carey's life is rocked by loss. Carey extends a hand of friendship to a disillusioned Brock.Having read &#34;Memorizing You&#34;. Mr. Skinner's second effort. I can see great leaps in his story telling.but don't let that deter you from reading this. It's just what you need for a summer read."
3,"Having read 'Memorizing You' by this author and thinking that it was one of the best books I had ever read. I was anxious to read his first book. 'CoverBoy.' This is a very sweet story of Brock. a man who has had everything and lost it. and Carey. a man who has sustained a loss. Both of these men find comfort with each other. and unlike other reviewers. I found this refreshingly sweet and very believable. I liked the line in the book.'There was no debate that the two of them needed each other. two displaced souls. to simply feel as if they had a place in a heartless world that appeared to have cast them off and forgotten them.'A good book and one that I'd recommend."
3,"Reviewed by Donna at [...]Jessie has been hurt so many times that she has absolutely no expectations when it comes to men.  She knows that all men will eventually hurt her. so she protects herself the only way she knows how.Wade is in love with Jessie. and he can't see himself ever being happy without having her as his wife.  When fate drops a whammy of a surprise in the middle of his seduction. can he adapt and overcome the obstacles that the past and present have thrown in his way?Mackenzie McKade writes seductive stories that are wicked and sexy and funny with hunky studs. wanton heroines. titillating plots and realistic settings.  Of course. the sex scenes are bone melting and the ending is a happily-ever-after.  I would love to read about Clancy's happily-ever-after. too!"
3,"Between political struggles and his being a vegetarian. I was looking for a bit more on the spiritual side. After all. he was called Mahatma. Which means great soul. (This review has to be short.)Gandhi was confronted by Christians who wanted to sell him their twisted idea of Christianity. Actually he was greatly moved by Tolstoy's work; Tolstoy hated how Christians distort the teachings of Jesus. and are so anxious to wage war. Jesus taught 'love thy neighbor' and &#34;turn the other cheek&#34;.He struggled with diet. he refused to eat meat. eggs. and refused even milk. In the end he tried to subsist on fruit juices. Gandhi believed that abstinence was important in realizing God. yet he was disgusted by his own lust and how he treated his wife."
3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
3,"This book was a recent Kindle Daily Deal and I decided to take a flyer on it. While I like anthologies. ones as topical as this one aren't what I usually read. So I had my doubts about how I'd like it.But the gamble paid off well; I thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole. The stories range from touching to humorous. While I'm usually not a fan of 'country humor' (who can compare to Twain?). the humorous stories in this book weren't bad. The non-humorous ones were pretty good.Even though I wasn't raised in the South. all of my extended family was and many of these stories reminded me of my childhood when I used to spend time there."
3,"These are very nicely written with lots of great vocabulary which I love especially since I have the click link for full definition!  The mysteries are not written from the point of view of the doctor. so you get to wait until the testimony to see if your accused will be found guilty! Some follow the &#34;Watson&#34; style character. some follow the innocent person caught in a horrible web of guilt. and some even follow the perpetrator! They are quite wonderful. Slight warning for you to be aware that in those times often the 'gentlemen' and 'ladies' (whites) are considered less &#34;suspicious&#34; than the &#34;foreign&#34; characters. But if you only read books with modern mores you will miss much."
3,"Dr. Thorndyke delves into early forensic science or in the language of his age. medical jurisprudence. He is a mixture of Sherlock Holmes and Gideon Oliver. The books include two novels and two books of short stories. They are all well written and fun to read although I chose 4 stars because they also tend to be repetitive. Thorndyke is always reviewing all the facts of the case meaning we get to read the same information at least twice. I enjoyed the volume though and would recommend it for light easy reading ~ especially if you are at all interested in bodies and bones."
3,"I gave the Craig Kennedy collection four stars. catering to those who like forensic investigations when the science was in its infancy. Actually. I liked the Thorndyke stories better. His cases are more believable. better written. and the characters are developed better. I read all of the books in this volume and enjoyed my time. Still. the procedures are a bit tedious since as a rule they are pretty familiar to most readers. Forensic science has progressed so much more. but if you like this period of history. you will enjoy Thorndyke. --Dr. William H. Stephens. retired editor"
3,"I just love these old mysteries and Freeman's are not as slow moving nor as  lugubrious and verbose as others. For myself. I find they are an easy read; that is. beautifully written. engaging and enjoyable.I especially liked the short stories and Helen Vardon and did not find the typos to be onerous. not finding above half a dozen in the last full-length novel. I am definitely going to be acquiring more of this author's work.  Thank you Amazon for making these pieces available and at such reasonable prices. In fact. many are free!!"
3,"This is quite a bit different from Volume 1.  The first few stories were written from the perspective of the criminal committing the crime which was somewhat different.  But enter Dr. Thorndyke and justice is served.  The author is somewhat of a loquacios writer in that 10 or 20 words are used when 1 or none would do.  But he really does set the scene.  The authors of mysteries always need to create the  crimes and clues to match the expertise of esoteric knowledge of the protagonist but some of the these stories are over the top. However they are still very interesting and impart facts that I wasn't aware of.  They are extremely fun and interesting reads and I will continue to search for more like them."
3,"As with any &#34;frontier&#34; the American west had its share of opportunists. dreamers. hard working folks. bigger than life characters. and dangerous misfits.  The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid.  Pat Garrett's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was.  For anybody with an interest in America's frontier days this is a great read."
3,"I found Vol 1 to be well written blending both the old and the new.  It was true to a singular focus and the characters were unique.  I enjoyed the banter between Maggie and Link and it reminded me of the 'Moonlighting' TV series of years past with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd.  I admit I wanted to strangle Maggie many times but that was part of her charm (I guess).I don't have any idea of the authenticity of La Malinche or Montezuma's Treasure itself and that is not important.  The author made it all believable to me in a fictional way.  I give Vol 1 5 stars and commend the author for a job well done."
3,"Griffin is a man on flight. His family wants him dead and he has no one and no where to go. He is young and smart but in an post apocaliptic world he is alone. And one night. in an alley. he is shot dead. Or he thinks so. But then Jarrah arrives to help him.Jarrah is a vampire. A former doctor he cherishes the human life above all. And he hates himself to be a vampire. And like Griffin. he is alone.Griffin is immediately drawn by the vampire. better by the man. although it is the first time he feels sexual desire for a man. But it is not a gay thing. it is the need of a lonely soul to share its feeling. And doesn't matter if this soul is of a man. Love is above the gender.A very beautiful novel. very intimate and close: for the most part shared between the two characters. it has also very well written sex scenes."
3,"This book didn't really go the way I thought it would.  For one. I expected more action overall with the fact that Griffin is being hunted and I also didn't expect him to find out about Jarrah so quickly.  The dystopian society was a nice touch but I would have liked some more detail about it to make the backbone of the story a little stronger.  Overall I liked the story but. honestly. I think it would've been better if there had been more conflict; really the entire thing was just too EASY and that's a shame because I could see the potential for a more in depth story."
3,"Alma Owens narrates a very interesting picture of life in the days without running water. indoor plumbing and having baby after baby and loving each and every one of them (the children. not the hardships).  Its written in a way that if you close your eyes and listen to her words you feel as though she is speaking just to you. regarding her life when times were very very hard. Not driving she had a very limited means of getting around places until she was older and then she learned to drive.  Her husband was not encouraging in her getting out and about on her own. and in some way. not real supportive. but that was the way men were in those days.  I loved this book and highly recommend it to anyone wanting an very interesting peek into America's history."
3,"This love story is delightful.  Ryan and Mariah . a workaholic father and a genius child.  are living a life devoid of real happiness.  Ryan wants to secure Mariah' s future. by making a fortune and having Mariah' s intellect developed.  Being at work and not spending time with Mariah. causes her to look for a mother.  Chance brings Kelsey into the father and daughter's lives.  Bringing these three people together makes their story an enjoyable and interesting  read.  The author.  makes each character  realistic. This was quick read because I could not put the book down.  I hope everyone will enjoy this much as I did.  True romance will always win with me."
3,"If you would like to save your money you can simply go to the authors website and subscribe to some kindle blogs as there is nothing and I mean nothing that cannot be found easily by taking the review list on this page (list of &#34;whats inside&#34;) and cut and past into google with the added words ON KINDLE. Youre now done. While the author clearly means well. this how to is a big let down. Full of links to elsewhere instead of explaining within its contents. Very very very very short book. I hate to give negative reviews but this should have been so much better. I feel kind of ripped off even for paying such a small amount of money. The author is talented enough to do a real job and live up to what we as Kindle people need and expect."
3,"I love how Dave Emberson breaks down Kindle procedures into clear steps. just like making an omelet. Do this. then do that.  If you follow his steps. you'll serve up a tasty banquet of new ways to enjoy your new Kindle. It's well worth the price. and his is a guide which I still consult often.  Dave is also updating his book frequently. which is an additional benefit of buying it. as well as a great example of the benefits of Kindle reading versus print.I interviewed Dave by telephone for the October 31. 2008 episode of my weekly audio podcast. The Kindle Chronicles. If you'd like to hear how he came to write the book and his thoughtful perspectives on the Kindle. here is the link: [...]"
3,"GREAT ADDITION TO THE LEARNING CURVE OF THE KINDLE.  Just finished reading the third edition of this book. I was surprised about the little tidbits that I didn't know about!!! My Kindle is used only for downloading books via either my computer or Whispernet from Amazon and of course reading them. I am not interested in using the Kindle for anything else so a lot of the book does not apply to my uses. But those that do are worth the small amount charged for this book. It is a bargain. Even my dogs are happy that I have converted over to the  Kindle since the pathways they use were growing smaller with each new book brought home."
3,"I wrote a 'downer' of a review yesterday...then realized that I hadn't read the entire book! Silly me...This is a very good 'cookbook' with clear directions and quite a bit of good help that isn't in the basic Kindle User's Guide. I know I'll have more fun with this new best friend of mine after I finish the cookbook and start trying all the things listed that one can do. Just the thought of being able to access my Gmail while going down the road in our RV makes my mouth water. Add to that the ease of reading with larger type...well. this Western Reader is one happy gal. Thanks. David. for all your hard work!"
3,"Mother and daughter and daughter's younger friend. Apart from being well --- if a little old fashioned ---written this book is one remarkable journey that every woman MUST read and every man must experience. It's a grand romp in the best tradition and nary a deviation into the horrors of modern day handcuffs and whippings and similar. It stays sexy and it stays erotically on track. It takes place at the farm where the servants are sent out of vision and earshot and the main players ....play! Sex in the best tradition. Read it and if you don't get a serious twitch every time you do...I feel sorry for you."
3,"I had the feeling based on the title that this was not going to be a piece of fine literature. but ...well...it still disappointed me.it has potential.  there is an intriguing back story of the 'hero' belonging to a group of powerful spies known as the Archangels. but that aspect is barely even fleshed out.Speaking of flesh....That's basically all this book is.  There are much better offerings.  I equate this to a Cinemax after dark video when it so easily could've been so much more."
3,"The storyline was very unique.  I am not going into the plot. because others have described it.  What I DIDN'T LIKE. was our H was nothing but a bully and was very demeaning in the first half of the book towards our h.  What I LIKED about the story. was the sex.  it was raw. very imaginative. and hot.  There was somewhat of a  story. in between the sex.  I didn't feel a connection to any of the secondary character's to read the rest of the series.  The next book is only 96 pages and is $2.99. at least this one was free. (ljb)"
3,"In these stories everybody smokes.  The courtesy of offering a pack of cigarettes is common. The characters are classic 50s people. as are the social proprieties. The illustrations are highly representative of the 50s science/fiction dime novel. and the magazines of that time. Although he was not the first to deal with the principle of multiple time lines. I think he was the first to base a series of stories on the concept. These have not aged well. but the science behind these stories are still valid. I will have to admit I read these stories after Fuzzy Sapiens. his masterpiece. and one of the top books of all time. certainly in this genre. We lost a great storyteller prematurely when he left us."
3,"I wasn't familiar with Piper until I happened across this 99 cent kindle compilation of five short stories (although I had read the first story 'Genesis' at some point in the distant past).  These are great examples of true classic sci fi stories. originally published in '50s pulp magazines.By and large. the stories hold up well but there are a few 'future' technology details that seem dated.  And like much pulp sci fi from the fifties you can see the unfortunate influence of McCarthyism; but. as with much older fiction if you can get past that and accept it as a reality of the time it was written. the story is very enjoyable.This inexpensive kindle editon is very well formated.  This little book serves as a great introduction to Piper or just as a quick read when you are in the mood for classic pulp stories."
3,"H Beam Piper will stand as one of the greats of sci-fi/fantasy for as long as the printed word exists. whether you are a mystery/thriller. detective novel or space opera/alternative universe fan. Piper delivers. In H B's writing you will find the forerunner of many who followed in his ginormous footsteps. (federated terran space. space vikings. even his place names have been copied by later writers! Aldebaran sound familiar)? Great reading. great fun and a must for anyone who really wants to be lost in another space/time continuum!"
3,"I have read the first two stories in this book and will not continue with it.  It does not read at all like science fiction. rather it reads like every day life in the 1950s with scholars studying Martians rather than Egyptians.  Really boring.Little Fuzzy looks to be a 'paid by the word' novella.  It could have been written in about one quarter of the words and space used.  The story is cute and well meaning in that what do we consider sapient.  I have learned that this is an author I will steer clear of.  It seems they sure did a lot of smoking and drinking in those days.  I find that this type of busy writing is just not my cup of tea. if you will."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
3,"I was eager to read this novel and downloaded it at the time it was 0.99. Big spender I know but I am glad I did not spend more. I was intrigued by the concept and some of the scenes of college life are both surreal and funny. Though that is all the positives I have for this meandering book. I mean there is no Jekyll Hide scenario. no ON/OFF if you will. Its like the whole book is more off than on. there is one speed and it is slow. Jamie Pepper undergoes an experiment to battle a disease of the brain. At first it seems effective. but is it really? Are these strange dreams he is having or is he doing things he is unaware of? None of it seems believable enough to me to warrant the climax. I will say that the life in the dorm aspect is entertaining and funny. but the novel as a whole was a big disappointment to me."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
3,"Such a shame that leaders controlling people elders etc are still wounding the body.Numbers of Christians that leave churches because they haven't. Found a way to cope with the pain of betrayal by those who are suppose to love them.Trusting in the power of God to change the situation until you know it's time to change churches take courage.This book maybe the answer to staying open to Gods purpose for you helping you work through the feelings and anger(at times) don't leave God don't stop loving God just because the waters are muddy in the church."
3,"What a dead end book! I not only struggled to read it as it was so boring yet forced myself to finish it to get the most ridiculous ending possible. It may be free but don&#8217;t waste your time as you&#8217;ll never get that back I sure wont. To make it worse the female lead was a split personality that went from a battered. scared introverted woman who was petrified of her husband to an independent. confident woman who could take on the world from the smile of a complete stranger she immediately fell in love with. The silliest book & biggest waste of my time & don&#8217;t expect much Native American storyline added in. the name and cover were about as good as it got"
3,"I love romances that are 'real' and this one is so very real. The characters are not larger than life. they have pasts. things they regret and dreams they have forgotten. They are real everyday people with everyday problems.When they find each other. their feelings re-awaken who they used to be and help them stand up and be that person.I loved this book. it was beautiful. sweet. sad in places and oh ever touching. watching the changes that true love brings to their outlook on life."
3,"This book was just okay. The story line was predictable and unmemorable. I couldn't even remember what the storyline was when I would pick it up in the evenings to read another chapter. I don't know about the print version of the book. but in the kindle version. there are many misspelled words which for a &#34;wordy&#34; like me. makes the book seem less than legitimate. I gave it 3 stars because it was better than some novels as far as content but is a far cry from being on anyone's best sellers list."
3,"I wish I could give half stars. If so. I would give this 3 1/2 stars. but I can't so I will be nice and give it 4. It's not a bad book for the price (I got mine for $0.99). I will say that the editing was simply atrocious. but if you can get around that. it is a quick read. The characters are likeable and the story moves along pretty quickly. However. there were a few parts that I felt were too contrived and not overly believable to actually happen in real life. BUT. the love scenes were HOT and steamy. very well done. I finished this in a day. so go ahead and read this if you are a fan of the author (which I am) and are interested in escaping reality for a few hours."
3,"I was pleasantly surprised by the real-world perspective McCray brought to this story. The female lead demonstrates growth without being whiny and the male lead is developed with an interesting Native American flavor. Indian Moon will satisfy readers that enjoy romance but it also appears to other readers that crave more than just a love story. I found the theme of commercial development vs. environmental preservation interesting as well and that added yet another layer of interest for me as someone that does not typically read romance novels.And any book with both a Rob Zombie AND a Motley Crue reference in it are cool with me ;)This a great beach read. You won't be disappointed."
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
3,"These two have a relationship gone bad and he doesn't know why. She pushed him away because of her fears but he is determined to not let that come between them.  He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one. but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."
3,"This is the story of Devin. a skittish diva who is running from love and Erik. the man hell bent on chasing her crazy behind until she admits she loves him and is ready to move their relationship to the next level. I LOVED this short story to pieces!!!Erik is in love with Devin and has asked her to move in with him. Devin. afraid of living the hellish life her parents lived. is gun shy when it comes to commitment and decides moving in with Erik is going too far too fast so she dumps him.The chase and capture is funny as all get out! Devin finally relents under what I can only describe as the sexiest. most sensually erotic siege it has ever been my honor to behold. I wish I could give this more stars.Well done!**BEST READ: with a glass of Blackberry Merlot and chocolate dipped strawberries! Have your little black book handy. you might need to call in reinforcements LOL!!!"
3,"I loved this shorter story about Zadist. Bella and Nalla. I had no idea that they were having troubles in their marriage. I couldn't believe that things almost didn't work out for them. My heart was breaking for Bella and Nalla. and Zadist too because of everything that he was going thru. It's like a normal every day marriage - there was lack of communication and I was so happy that during the read they were able to figure out what they needed to figure out. talk about what they needed to talk about. and work it out. Oh I just love the whole series and can't wait for March 2013. Once again J R Ward outdid herself with this short story about the now happy lil perfect family!"
3,"While I wholeheartedly agree that the lenghth of the book is disceptive that should not detract from an excellent story.  Give the publisher hell they deserve it.  Back to the story. it was great.  The author explores the fact tha HEA does not come without set backs and challenges.  The love of Z and Bella proves worthy of these challenges.  The story of the plastic surgeon and his wife was beautiful.  They are characters worthy of the series.  Inspite of its length the story rates a great read."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"Zsadist is one of my favorite brothers----oh. who am I kidding. they are all my favorite because JR Ward is the BEST---so I was really excited to see that we get a continuation of his story in this novella.I was disappointed to see that it was only 96 pages. but as usual. JR Ward made every word count and it was an emotional. heartfelt 96 pages.  I think I teared up three times. and my husband kept asking me what was wrong.I'm no fan of short stories or novellas but I loved Father Mine.  I think it is the best novella I've ever read.Just One Gripe:It was just too short!The Best Thing About This Book:I liked seeing someone working through their problems in therapy.  I liked that the problems weren't magically solved by love."
3,"Zsadist is my favorite brother.  He won my heart in book 2 'Lover Eternal'.  He can be stubborn but so why so many threats. Bella?I am disappointed with Bella.  She has her fears and they are true concerns. but she knew Z was not much of a talker when she mated him.  Instead of talking to each other. they let their thoughts build up and neither one of them can read minds.  So Bella is left with threats and ultimatums.  And that just broke my heart.  All ends well but it was 'much to do about nothing' if they only talked to each other.Any Z & Bella fan. this is a must read!"
3,"This is a sweet book about Zhadist and what he does to put his past behind him so that he can have the future he truly wants with his mate and child.And what a mate he has.  She is perfect for him.  Understanding and loving and willing to do whatever is necessary to protect her child and assure the future she deserves.  She is strong and determined and yet loving and accepting for Zhadist as he is as well as the horrible past that has molded him into the person he is now.And what love Zhadist has for Bella.  He is willing to do whatever must be done to exorcise his demons so he can give her and his child the life they deserve.  A truly touching story of love.This story is a must read for any BDB fans."
3,"As usual J.R.Ward doesn't disappoint with this Novella of Zsadist and Bella!! The only thing that upset me was that I wished it was as long as her other Black Dagger Brotherhood books but I realize this was a Novella so I get it! I have already recommended this series to many of my friends and they love them as much as I do!!! I can't wait for the next book of this series that comes out in April...Thank you J.R. Ward for making me so happy just by reading your amazing books...You're a true talent!!!"
3,"I was looking for a book to download to my Kindle when I ran across this extra story on my favorite characters from this author - Zsadist and Bella. All I can say is that I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by just how much plot and dialogue we got in this continuation of one of my favorite couples.The story covers the difficulties for Zsadist and Bella when they had their first child. I really like how it explores just the pocket of time when fatherhood was pretty new for Zsadist - and how the couple worked through it. It really just gives us 15 minutes more with our favorite JR Ward characters!So if their story was your favorite book in the series. then I recommend that you read this story. You will enjoy it."
3,"Father Mine is a short story that is a continuation of Zsadist and Bella's story. It picks up sometime after Lover Enshrined. but going on at the same time as well.This story starts after Nalla is born. about three months after. in fact. Zsadist is still having a hard time dealing with his past as a blood slave. and it's taking a toll on his mating. and with his relationship with his daughter.This is a sweet. romantic story that I was hoping for. having finished Lover Awakened and almost feeling cheated by the ending. This book gives Bella and Z their HEA. and it really makes me love Z more. Great short story. and a must-read for any BDB fans. :)"
3,"This novella was super cute. Zsadist and Bella are one of my favorite couples in this series and ever since we saw she got pregnant. and how dangerous these moments are for vampires. things changed a little in their relationship. We can see Zsadist more concerned with Bella but talking less about their life. Nalla was born in the end of the previous book and everything looked perfect. but reading this story is clear to me that Zsadist needed more time to understand the new reality and his fears are still very close to the surface. so it took him some difficult moments.I loved this new glimpse in their life together. I think we could have more insights like this for the other couples. since we lose touch with them as this series grow."
3,"I downloaded this book right after I read Zsadist's story in the series.Needless to say. I loved this book.  While I didn't like the beginning because of the turmoil that was going on with Zsadist and his unacceptance of his daughter.I sped through the book because I needed to know that he overcame his obstacles and as usual the book did not disappoint.I was happy for Zsadist when he finally worked through his issues and was delighted to see the family dynamic between him. his wife and his daughter.Great read.  I would love to read about Rhage and Mary as the author hinted in this book that Mary wanted to have a child.  Also. and update on the King and Queen would be nice."
3,"I read and enjoyed the prequel to this book. Lover Awakened. so I thought I would try this shorter e-pub. It was good!As a new father. Z must come to terms with his past so he can embrace fatherhood. and baby Nella. without fear. Tender scenes with Z. Bella. and Nella. Sizzling sex. too.SPOILER -----I was expecting the visit to the dermatologist / plastic surgeon to end differently. Usually. in most romances. everything gets tied up in a pretty bow. but that gets old. This seemed more authentic."
3,"I usually enjoy books by Ms. James. but this book I found to be boring.  My attention kept drifting elsewhere.  I thought perhaps if I closed the book. and returned to it later. that this would solve the problem.  Nope...it wasn't that I wasn't focused...the story was just boring.  Even the sex scenes were blah...I skimmed them!!! I also don't understand why this is labeled as an anthology...there's only one story in the book. unless the excerpts of other works are included under the definition of an anthology.  The story ended at 88% of the kindle content."
3,"I loved that Megan's got a mate...it was a needed end to a series. The angst of her journey was well written if a little more intense than I liked. I would've let Lex beat the snot out of him! Because  Shane was not any kind of alpha hero but a selfish self-centered snotty momma's boy. Lauren did not ease me into liking him...he was spoiled and shallow from the beginning as a written character and she never corrected that impression thru his words and deeds ...so the end came and I didn't believe in the change of heart. Megan ...and the series as a body of work... is the only reason this one gets even 3 stars. Warning: the hero is a good looking wuss!"
3,"I'm not sure why some of the reviewers were so hard on this book- I wasn't expecting a great work of fiction- and it's eroticia- so my expectations weren't great.  However- this book is well written and the characters are well developed.  Unlike most eroticia- where the characters are faced with a serial killer. a stalking ex. or a bank robber (none of which ever seem all that real to me). the big issue this couples faces is realistic and typical.  Does that make for an exciting escape for the readers?  Probably not- but it felt real to me.  This was the first f/m/f book I've ever read.  I was leary of it. but it was done tastefully. I would gladly read this author again."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
3,"What do you get when you mix sci-fi and romance? Well if you're Cathryn Cade you get a compelling mix of the best of both genre's.In Tyger. Tyger Burning Bright we are introduced to the crew of the The Orion. the space ship version of a cruise ship. We meet some of the crew but this novel centers around the ships navigation officer Tyron Jag who goes through the mating shift while trying to navigate the new ship through an area of space that needs his expertise. We also meet Calla Fellura a novice crew member and the ships interpreter.The heat between Ty and Calla is intense. this is a total panty wringer. it is also amazingly well written with characters that are funny as well as sexy and with a plot that keeps you turning the pages and reaching for the next book. The world that has been created and the species that are developed are both fun and imaginative.While each novel is self contained it is best read in order so the sub plots in the novels are more understood."
3,"What an amazing disappointment this short story was.  (And believe me..it's short.)I was hoping for what the product description promised:'a story full of passion. intrigue. humor and good old-fashioned romance'What I got was poorly written smut. cheesy sex scenes and zero plot.  The characters were flat. lifeless and completely drab.  This belongs on an erotica forum site for people to post their sexual fantasies.  It is not even remotely close to being worthy of being called a book. short story. or even ebook!My only consolation comes from the fact that I downloaded this while it was free on Amazon and did not waste my money on this badly written smut fest.Do not waste your time or your money.You will regret it."
3,"This is a fun read. like a fantastically cheesy Sci-Fi channel movie. but with a lot more sex.Basically. you've got a ship imperiled by the dual threat of an eco-terrorist on board and the main navigator being rendered useless by his &#34;tyger mating shift.&#34;  Apparently these things are controlled by the moon yet also somewhat unpredictable and now he's got to have a tyger female to mate with.  Oh. there's a cute young female tyger on board?  Well. awesome.They frolic in the garden.  That's the only reason to read the book (the plot is very basic) and the author delivers.  If you like lite-shifter alpha male scenes with a less experienced female. I recommend.  I don't recommend this for anyone who might be downloading this for the sci-fi (the sci-fi is simply the setting. the sex is why the story exists).  It's a really fun read. but not much more."
3,"So amid all of the intentional spelling (tiger = tyger/tygre. bright= bryght) and tiger references (tyger-honey or tyger-pussy or tyger-mate.....we get it! they are 'tygers') there was a solid story here that was very sexy. However it got a bit repetitive. It was also a bit short (but thanks to the other review I was sort of expecting it. thanks!) The only things that bothered me aside from the spelling and repetition was that it was short. I mean. not physcially short...but if you ignore all the repetitiveness there isnt very much there. So. 3 stars."
3,"I read this entire series and really enjoyed them. This last book was better than I thought. based on the reviews I read. Wasn't really necessary to go along with the rest of the series. but I enjoyed it and usually. I like to read all the books in a grouping. I read books so fast that sometimes by the time I write a review I need to go back and jog my memory. This is definitely worth the read and especially if you have read the rest. I cant say its the best of the bunch. but try it."
3,"The first thing that stuck out for me in The Unmasking of Lady Loveless was the great characters. The author did a wonderful job in such a short piece of writing and I felt her talent really shone through for the genre.With an orginal storyline and interesting twists along the way. this historcial reeled me in and kept me enchanted right to the end.For those who rag on the length. you do realize this is a short? That's the whole point of The Undone Line. If you somehow feel ripped off. I suggest making yourself aware of that before buying."
3,"This is a very short novella . Lord Alexander Beaumont goes into Whites and notices everyone is treating him oddly.He finds out his estranged wife has written an erotic book.It is written under the name of Lady Loveless and  has set the ton on edge. The book is all about their sexual escapades. They are saying it is Lady Milecent since her madiden name is used to send it to be published. He decides to go and seduce his shy and cold wife he hasn't seen her in two years.He plans on using scences from her books. She is living with her alcoholic brother and hypochondric mother.I won't give you any more details of the story you will have to read it to find out if they can get together after this time. It is short but a nice  read."
3,"I admit. being a Harlequin Mini. I didn't expect much. but this was so much fun to read!  It starts out with Lord Alexander Beaumont learning that his wife (who he hasn't seen in years) writes erotica novels under the identity 'Lady Loveless'.  Because of this. he decides to pay her a visit.His wife. Melicent. is taking care of her ailing mother and is shocked when her husband arrives out of the blue.  I can't say anymore to the plot without giving it away. but it was a lot of fun and some unexpected surprises popped up which had me laughing.  I thought there was the perfect blend between plot. characterization. and sex.  And to add. the sex wasn't like most of the sex scenes you see in books.  The author used some great creativity in this area.Definitely worth the price and the 5 star rating!"
3,"This story is very short (think novella). but it it's very well-written and the plot moves at a nice. quick pace. This is a great. easy read for a few hours (especially for the beach or that plane trip).The story revolves around an estranged couple. a misunderstanding. and a cute and funny revelation at the end.I don't really understand the negative/mediocre reviews. because I personally loved this story.  I get that everyone has their own opinion. but if you're a fan of adult historical fiction. you will definitely enjoy this!"
3,"The book was OK. There was little development on the characters. It was like walking into a room where the movie is half over and only watching like 10 minutes. There really was no background except the constant reminder that she was abused. You don't even know what she does at work except sit at a desk. It could have been developed more. I enjoyed Make Mine Midnight better. At least those characters had some history and was slightly developed in the story on why they wanted a lifetime commitment. These guys just start right off wanting this lifetime commitment but you are not told what has inspired them to go after Christine."
3,"This story was more a rough draft than anything that should have been published. First thing. the two men. we know they're ex-Seals. but we have no idea what they REALLY do for a job in this book (security?). how they came there. and what POSSIBLE interest they have in Christina since she is skittish and phobic. Off the bat. theyre trying to get in Christina's pants for a life time relationship... are you kidding me? Serious? All of a sudden they're flying from an unknown location to Chicago in their personal jet with a king size bed? Kidnap her dog? Its frustrating... this book was scattered in thought. execution and information."
3,"This is a sequel to Two Sighted. I suggest you read that first to get full understanding of the story. Christina. TJ and Jon were featured in Two Sighted and this story picks up shortly afterward.Christina has been fighting her attraction to TJ and Jon for a long time. she doesnt' trust men and from their physical size. she's sure the can't trust them. In addition she can't decide which one she's attracted to if she can overcome her trust issues. She's heard rumors but they couldn't possibley be true. could they?TJ and Jon have been waiting for Christina to show some interest and finally they feel she's ready. They have been ready and now is the time! But Christina's family is once again coming between her and her future.I love Ann Jacobs sensual romances because they tell a story. you don't just get continous sex."
3,"This book confused me from the beginning all the way to the end. It starts without any pre story. You dont know anything about any of the characters. all you get is this woman who is scared of men. these two 'hot' guys that work with the girl a best friend who sets something!!! up. it doesnt really say until it gets hot and steamy. So its 0 to 10 in all of 3 seconds. This book lacked details that developed the characters and not knowing details made it seem very unbelivable."
3,"We know why we read these books. the not sex.  But I do want some feeling as to why these people are so in love.  For them it isn't just about the sex. it emotional.  But the problem with most short stories is that the reader is plopped down in the middle of these relationships and we have no time to feel what the characters are supposed to be feeling.Then there was the heroines family.  Not well done.  I think the author is capable of writing a good story but she make it impossible to believe the situations because it had to be rushed.  Not well done."
3,"I liked this one. It wasn't all about the sexy times together. It was really more of a story. which I enjoyed.Christina doesn't trust men. Her father is an abusive alcoholic and her brother turned out exactly the same. So. she left but it's left her scarred. She wished more than anything her mother would leave. and can't understand why she doesn't. You sort of knew what was going to happen but it was a bit more surprising than that.I liked it. It was sexy. sweet. and enjoyable."
3,"Can a woman from an abusive background find love and a lasting relationship. Apparently so. Can she find the love she needs in a menage a trois? Apparently so. Chris is able to overcome the trauma of being raised by an alcoholic abusive father and a mother who was completely submissive to him. Throw in a brother who has grown up to be just like the father and this poor girl has a lot to overcome. She did with the help of her lovers Jon and TJ. This is a short read can be done in one evening. While not out standing was entertaining. Chris is to be given a lot of credit for her strength in overcoming her horrible background."
3,"Right off the bat I have to say the character development is epic!  My emotions were all over the place with this one.  The main characters made me angry. sad. and frustrated but yet I want them to work and be happy!  Crazy huh?  Because Kalleysten has taken the time to develop these interesting characters. it was easy to purchase the next book in the series.  (I was given a copy of Blurred Nights in exchange for an honest review.) Although I have to admit I would like to see certain characters end up together. I can't wait to see how the rest of the story is written.  This was a great start to the series although I think a prologue about vampire/human pacts would have been helpful.  After you read this one be prepared to order the next!"
3,"This story was not like the other books I've read from Kallysten in the past. I found it difficult to engage in the story at the beginning. However. once I stuck it out past the first 5 or 6 chapters. I was pleasantly surprised. I found that instead of the instant sex appeal and gripping tensions with characters that immediately immersed me in the past. it was a story that read like a slow burn. gradually building up layers of complexity. and personality in all the players involved. By the time I was half way through the book. Kate's issues were personal to me. and I was rooting for them to find a way to make it work. I actually cried towards the end of this book. and that's an incredibly rare thing for me as a reader. So although it took me longer to get into the characters and their story. it was well worth it to keep it up. and see it through to the end."
3,"In world that is invaded by demon like creatures. humans and vampires are fighting back using a variety of methods that they can use but in the end...This story goes deeper than that. it is about acceptance and forgiveness as well determination to know what you want and going for it. It is for believing things that you may not want to see...The book was captivating like many of Kallysten's books are but the descriptive about the different elements were fascinating and it was an enjoyable book to read.  Overall I would rate this book a solid 4 stars.If you like paranormal elements as well as futuristic sci-fi books then this is one you may enjoy as well.I am looking forward to the next installment in the series.I received a copy of the book from the author. thank you."
3,"Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available."
3,"If I had to use just one word to describe this book it would be. Awesome! I absolutely loved it! I only put it done when necessary. and finished it in one day (which is hard to do when you have two daughters lol). I'm an action kind of girl and this book is full of it.Even though Marc hurt Blake in the past. Blake is still loyal and cares for his sire. though he still harbors some feelings of rejection and hurt. When they meet Kate they are quite surprised by her. Through a game of conquest to gain the affection of Kate. they not only both fall for her but they also settle some issue from the past. There is a little m/m sex and some erotic dreams. not much. but what is there is totally hot!"
3,"Complimentary Review Copy Provided by Author. Demons. Vampires and Humans at war. Check. Vampires on the side of humans. Check. Plenty of action. Check. Romance between vampire and human. Check. Hot sexy scenes. Check. Tension between Sire and Childe. Check. All the boxes keep getting checked but. seriously. this is one great story that keeps the reader on the edge with action and sexual tension from page one until the end and leaves me. for one. eager to read books two and three in this Blurred trilogy within the Demon Age series."
3,"In Blurred Nights Marc is Blake's sire to become a vampire. Blake is a unique vampire in the world where they join humans to fight the demons that come from the earth to kill humans and spread terror. The immature Blake finds fighting demons a game. although a deadly game. while Marc is committed to the ancient ideas that vampires were put on earth to protect and help humans.The conversations full of wit between the two vampires. the underlying love for each other that they will not express in words and the competition for the attentions of the beautiful human woman fighter. Kate makes this a great story. Blake keeps coming up with new ways to keep the story flowing and interesting along with the well written sex scenes as they keep hunting the demon's breech.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review; the opinions expressed are my honest opinions. If you like paranormal and vampires. this is a very good story that I highly recommend."
3,"3.5*This is a very good start to the serial series. Vampires and Mages help humans fight the Demons. Marc and Blake are vampires. Marc is Blake's sire. one night while fighting Demons they come across a small group of humans also fighting Demons. Among the group is Kate a well seasoned fighter and one of the groups leaders. Marc and Blake take the group back to there base camp where they end up not being allowed to leave until they prove they have not killed any humans. Through close quarters and fighting together Marc. Blake and Kate start to care for each other. I'm looking forward to reading the next story. There is a very nice excerpt at the end for the next release. It will suck you right in."
3,"I have read a few of Kallysten's books. and I have to say she never disappoints. Loved the storyline and the action in this book. Kallysten's words give you the feeling as if you are right there living the story. I found this future world very intriguing. where humans and vampires are fighting together against their enemy demons. Kate. a human fighter and strong woman finds herself attracted to Marc and Blake. her vampire allies. Even though she has this strong feeling for both men she tries her best not to come between them. Marc and Blake have their own special bond as Sire and Childe and I can't wait to see how all three character's relationship progresses. Kallysten is a great story teller and her descriptive details in all her stories are worth reading. She has become one of my favorite authors."
3,"Although this isn't the usual kind of read I expect when I think of Kallysten it's definitely got her touch.  I'm used to more erotic vs. sensual romance although this story lacks in the erotic it doesn't lack for emotion or conflict.Kate is an extremely strong female. Marc is a Vampire and Blake is his Childe.  The three make for amazing chemistry and witty banter.  From first meeting there is a spark and although Kate is put off by Blake's cocky attitude she's extremely intrigued by Marc and his relationship with Blake.  Kate has lived as a soldier for quite some time. she's bonded as a warrior with her fellow teammates. Marc and Blake bring the woman back out in her.  They all give one another a different perspective on why their fighting and exactly what their fighting for.I enjoyed this book and will definitely be finishing the trilogy. I can't wait to find out more about these characters."
3,"I bought a Kindle 1 from my friend. It allows me to enjoy books and preiodicals again with its large print and clear e-ink. It frees me from reading large print only on the computer.I subscribe to USA Today's e-Edition. It looks like the printed paper. I can save it as a pdf and enlarge the print. The problems are: there is more information in each daily than I can absorb. and I'm stuck in front of a computer.I prefer the Kindle edition  of USA Today. It is more concise. thankfully. It's easy to navigate through articles and sections. and so is a quicker read.It would be nice if the publisher allowed downloading editions I might have missed. Until then. I must keep the online e-Edition subscription for past issues.I am totally happy with USA Today's Kindle Edition. Thanks!Arthur."
3,"I've been reading USA Today for over 5 years. I love the content. the features. the pictures. It's my favorite newspaper.Trying out the Kindle version. you get the articles but sometimes they're not formatted correctly. I did notice some black and white photos. Even if they had the photos that accompany the article in black and white that would be good.I tried it for a week while on vacation. I was able to keep up to date with the news but after that week. I decided to cancel it. I can't see myself canceling my print edition to read it on  Kindle.Hopefully. they'll improve it in the future. But now. just try it out for free to see for yourself."
3,"The USA Today via the Kindle is well done. We normally subscribe to the USA Today and the Washington Post. Yes you lose the color graphics but that is not a detriment if you want to read the news while traveling without having to find the paper on sale. Navigation around among the sections and the articles is very easy and intuitive. My husband had never used my Kindle and I gave it to him to read the paper and he had no problem with it.  Don't compare the USA Today with other newspapers. for the USA Today gives you just the facts and you provide your own opinion as it should be. Reading a story in the USA Today is about  the size of the exact same story in the Post but the Post provides a lot of opinion which I don't need. I form my own opinion after reading the paper. The Editorial page along with the Letters to the Editor are on the Kindle along with the sports. life. and all the world news. Great paper!!"
3,"First of all let's look at what makes USA Today readable in its print version:It is concise.well written and tries to cover all the major international.national and domestic news stories in an easy to read. user friendly format. It may not offer the intellectual brooding of papers like the NY Times but it also does not trivialize news like the New York tabloids.The USA Today just gives us the basics.In this regard it is ideally suited for the Kindle since the paper's format makes it easy to catalog and present news in its simplest form.The only reasons it gets 4 stars:1. The price needs to be lower since it is not published on weekends.2. I still am reserving the 5th star for the day when technology can make Kindle incorporate graphics.comics.crossword puzzles etc;"
3,"I see that some people did not rate this high.  'BUT' I have read the whole series.  This series is about 6 women who met in college and became fast friends.  They have nothing in common.  You really need to read the entire series to find out why they were pulled to each other.  I have read the entire series 3 times.  I loved it.  There are 6 Vamps too.  They have all been friends for thousands of years.Each book bings in new characters and of course keeps the former characters too.These books are full of action. adventure. 'SEX' and strong women and men.'WARNING' These books are 'R' rated.  No 'holes' barred in this series.  LOL!!!!!!!LOVE MY VAMPS/SHIFTERS/STRONG WOMEN/AND BEASTS OF MEN.  LOL!!!"
3,"I though the book was really good I liked how they got together and didn't play games like most romance novels will sometimes do I hate that now the only thing that I feel should have been done to this book is the ending needs to be changed did she move in with him did they get married what happened and when her dad said he was going to clean house I think we should have known what ever came of that since it was dealing with what happend to Cyn's dress other than that I found the book to be really good I read it in 3.5 hours the sex between them will have you thinking you are there with them great hot love"
3,"Aside from some formatting errors and the need to place breaks where some scenes change this was the cleanest text I have come across recently in a WM/BW e-book romances. This author must have an editor and this reader appreciates that.Loved the story and the cute take on the Cinderella story.  The characters were fun. sexy and well developed. I disagree with those who disliked the ending.  You know where Cyn and Parker are going to end up and you know Dad what her Dad is going to do no need to spell it out. I am looking forward to reading more books from Lena Matthews"
4,"This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of 'A Christmas Carol.'Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade. a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.His visit by the spirits. the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him. leads to a very sentimental ending.It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past."
4,"The first time I saw &#34;An American Christmas Carol&#34; I immediately fell in love with it.  I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story. acting. directing. camera work. costumes. sets. locations. music. and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor. but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.CA Luster"
4,"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur 'The Fonz' Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts. he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it. as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection."
4,"When this first aired in 1979. I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS. I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD. this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago. and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away."
4,"How coincidental that this program. aired by ABC in 1979. is set in the USA during the Depression era and here we are 30 years later. in 2009. experiencing an economic malaise of our own!  I remember having seen this on TV but viewing it again now on DVD made me realize that I'd forgotten about how downright mean and cold-hearted Henry Winkler's character. Benedict Slade. really is!!!  Politically-correct viewing in the 21st Century has really insulated from harsh emotions such as those portrayed by Mr. Winkler.  The production has that 70's look to it but it is well done and the actors and actresses all bring an unpolished genuine-ness to their parts.  Being a fan of 'A Christmas Carol' by Charles Dickens. I am pleased to have this rendition alongside other classic versions as well as the 1984 IBM production."
4,"Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic. One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy. The general feel of this movie. though. is grey. That's the best way to describe it. But then. it was a bleak grey time in American history. with the Great Depression and all. When Dickens originally wrote the book. it was a grey time in England's history as well. so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story.A nice twist (sorry. Oliver!) to a true classic.By the way. for my money. the finest original version out there is the George C. Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim."
4,"This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character. although well known by most. is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale."
4,"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However. it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit. and partly to my own blame. I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in. but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called 'must have Christmas movies' then pass it up for another title."
4,"Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona. but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued. not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved. and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies."
4,"Nice drama- based on the original Christmas Carol movie.  This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America.  Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.  But most people can.t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has &#34;sold&#34;.  Soon &#34;ghosts&#34;- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past. present. and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his &#34;value system&#34; .  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.  Dramatic with poignant scenes.  Held my attention throughout!"
4,"&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;. At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all.but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better. that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge. even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
4,"When this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television. at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries. I was skeptical because I had been disappointed in the stories of Abraham and Jacob.This film. though. is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph.  It is truly astounding with a stellar cast!  Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance.  He tears the heart right out of you!  No less superb is Lesley Ann Warren as Potiphar's lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails.This film is incredible and not to be missed!  I always cry buckets of tears at the end!  A true masterpiece in every way!"
4,"I would have to say that this is one of the best 'made-for-TV' (on TNT) biblical films I've seen. The acting was phenominal. the scenery..EVERYTHING. This movie is dead-on when it comes to accuracy from the Bible. which is pretty rare..almost unheard of in this day in age. It's a refreshing movie that has an honest. uplifting theme that will inspire you and your family. It could have easily been released in the theaters and it probably could have been bigger in popularity with a wider-span of audience around the world. Even so. I'm just glad that I can now buy the DVD! :)"
4,"As the title says. unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him. which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife. Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through."
4,"I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean. what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!For fans of this movie. look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses. Abraham. David. Jacob. and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham."
4,"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet. sorry."
4,"This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph. the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.Joseph is the favored son of his father. a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery. he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor. and Joseph's steadfastness. he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him. seeking help. they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first. it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well."
4,"Though it's been a while. I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that 'disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent. even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex. challenging and convincing. it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection. Patheos(dot)com. 1996)"
4,"I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done. is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books. I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies. true to the Bible."
4,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but. if there weren't. the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that. even though this is a family story. there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting. really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing. you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
4,"If it weren't for the seduction scene with Potiphar's wife. this movie would have been excellent.  That scene was so sensual that it was borderline 'R' rated in our book.  I almost shut it off at that scene.  Before the actual Biblical account of Jospeh running off. leaving his garment behind him. there is a scene in which Potiphar's wife joins him in a bathing room and (while he is in a pool) clearly and very erotically reaches her hands under the water and strokes his private parts.  He doesn't flee that time!  This scene ruined the movie for us. and though we've enjoyed other movies from this series. we couldn't keep this movie because of that one scene.  Too bad!"
4,"As most movies. this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out. it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph. his family and those he met in Egypt.  A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences)."
4,"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well. even Potiphar's wife.As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but. have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby"
4,"The series are amazing! Thank God such biblical figures are protrayed with the  Lord God as foundation.I was expecting those usual blurry versions. but this is entirely different. Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.  The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy. anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory.Watch it!"
4,"Of all the TNT movies. this one is actually the weakest. But it is still a good movie. The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau.The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel. The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about. but not focused on. The non-Scriptural parts. though. were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way. it was very good.If you choose to watch this movie. you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced. Just be sure you don't base much theology on it. ;-)The movie is a solid PG movie."
4,"I thought that this film was really good. i just wish they had made it sutible for children by cutting out a few things and putting some clothes on the egyptian women.  I really liked the  end. it was so good. best part  in the entire movie and worth buying just for that. This movie made the  story so real especialy when Joseph's brothers throught him in the pit. it  makes you realize just how hard it was for him. that his own family would  betray him.  And to the person that said that Joseph's brothers didn't like  him because he was a proud arrogant tattle tale that is so un-true.  His  brother's hated him because he obeyed their father and because Jacob loved  Joseph more than them.  Joseph was ALWAYS faithful and obeyed God. He was  sold into Egypt not because he needed to be straightened out. but because  God had a plan to save all the land from famine including Joseph's family."
4,"This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs. never the less. it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be. for the most part. some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film. with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram. the movie Joseph coming in a close second. and this movie. Moses. coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others. but the effort is exemplary."
4,"TNT has put together a surprisingly good account of the Biblical story of  Joseph. betrayed into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers.  Martin  Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate  performances. with the role of Joseph also well-acted.  Leslie-Anne Warren is  the lustful wife of Potiphar. who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph.  and lands him in the Pharoah's prison.  This film offers a very credible  depiction of life in the ancient Near East. from the desert tents of the  Hebrews. to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem. to the lushness of  civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court. The film is faithful to the  Biblical account. and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen.  A  well-acted. well-scripted. and entertaining film.  END"
4,"This four hour video looks a the familiar &quot;Joseph&quot; story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First. it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say &quot;brava&quot; to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally. the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However. my &quot;four star&quot; rating refers to the &quot;flashback&quot; section of the film.  Yes. why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the &quot;B&quot; grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden."
4,"'Joseph' masterfully brings the pages of Genesis alive with the same grit. power. and passion of the Biblical narrative. The acting is of the highest quality. being highlighted by Ben Kingsley's brilliant portrayal of Potiphar. Despite some Hollywood license. 'Joseph' remains true to the Biblical narrative. even including the sorted accounts involving Tamar and Dinah (which should mark the movie with a PG rating). It is an epic motion picture. lasting over 3 hours. but there is nothing I would have been left on the editing room floor. 'Joseph' does have its weaknesses. yet the movie receives my very highest recommendation. In fact. it is so good. I consider it one of my all-time cinematic favorites. It left me inspired. encouraged. and in awe of God's faithfulness. You will not be disappointed!"

4,"This delightful 1969 animation based on the popular song is a holiday treat that many of us grew up watching. and now we can share it with our children.  By today's standards. the animation is crude. but the story is heartwarming and the narration and singing by Jimmy Durante make it a priceless treasure.We are introduced to Frosty. a snowman made by some school children with a corncob pipe. two lumps of coal and a magician's hat that brings him to life.  When the temperature starts to rise. Frosty hitches a ride on a freight train bound for the North Pole.  However. the evil Professor Hinkle is hot on his trail to try to melt Frosty and get his hat back.  Finally. Santa Claus saves the day.My son is almost three years old and he loved this video.  No doubt your child will too."
4,"Frosty the Snowman is a true Christmas classic. While my favorite Christmas special remains Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.I have a special place in my heart for Frosty the Snowman and I watch it 2-3 times every December.including every Christmas Eve night. The beauty of Frosty the Snowman is that it's about imagination. How much fun is it to imagine building a snowman and having it come to life. And just around Christmas too! That's the real beauty of Frosty the Snowman. Another strong point of this show is Jimmy Durante's singing of the song Frosty the Snowman. I bought an mp3 version of Jimmy Durante's Frosty the Snowman from this show last November and it is definitely the best version of the song Frosty the Snowman that I've heard.  I highly recommend this show as it is a true Christmas classic."
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
4,"Christmas is a time of tradition. whether from food. family. or fellowship.  It is also the season when Hollywood tries to create their own traditions with the numerous 'holiday specials' that clog the airways throughout the month of December.  'Frosty the Snowman' is the cream of the crop.The story is simple: A magic hat brings 'Frosty' the snowman to life. after which he must travel to the North Pole to prevent being melted.  Meanwhile. an evil magician is trying to redeem the hat for his own nefarious purposes.Since 1951. children and adults alike have enjoyed this half-hour special.  Kids will be sucked in by the magic and music. while adults may just find even their eyes welling up a bit when Frosty is threatened near the end.Along with Claymation Rudolph. this TV special should be required watching around the holiday season."
4,"&quot;Frosty Returns&quot; is the epitome of why classics from the 60s and 70s need not be remade.  Although Jonathan Winters does a respectable job as narrator. the story suffers from &quot;politically correct&quot; environmentalism and de-Christianization of Christmas.  None of it was necessary and detracts the story.Furthermore. there is no artistic continuity with the original &quot;Frosty&quot;.  None of the characters are depicted in their original form and the computer-aided animation doesn't really add anything. either.I was disappointed that this episode was included with the Frosty DVD.  The true and worthy sequel to the original Frosty is &quot;Frosty's Winter Wonderland&quot;.  Watch that instead as it is MUCH better than this one."
4,"This is with out a doubt is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen!  My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it. but that's the only reason.  The movie is filled with overdone. unrealistic. trite political issues of the 90's.  It was too complicated for a small child to follow and there was barely even a plot.  Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues.  There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd.  The original Frosty is so wonderfully simple. buy that one instead."
4,"Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable. I cringed when I watched this with my son. I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic. rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes. This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless. Oops! I said Christmas. I meant Happy Holidays!"
4,"This is a fairly short Christmas special but it was made in the old days when a half hour on TV contained only four minutes of commercials. The best part about The Little Drummer Boy is its wholesome simplicity. The fact that it is so unabashedly religious is its strongest point in my opinion. Chasing the hate out of your heart and replacing it with love is a valuable lesson for all children. so I agree with another reviewer about its being a timeless family classic. It begins rather slowly but the last five minutes are absolutely outstanding and worth scanning back to watch a second time. The quotations from scripture give it its oomph but this also means that it would never be televised today on any of the big three networks. This might be a good DVD to buy because you probably won't catch it for free."
4,"I have a three year old. and a five year old. They got this movie today in the mail. and have watched it twice now. They love it! It makes sense on a level that they can understand. The story clearly describes the birth of Jesus Christ. and the true meaning of Christmas. I love the fact that the dialog and narration include actual Biblical scripture.(KJV) Wish I had seen this movie when I was a kid. Grew up in a Christian home. and understood the holiday. but not at the same age as my girls now do. Movie was made by the same company and in the same style as the Burl Ives Rudolph movie with the puppets. Already a Christmas favorite to be watched with all the other holiday favorites years from now!"
4,"I was pleased to see this video when it first came out and I recommend it very much. I watched it with my sons. who were born in 1965 and 1966. all the years they were growing up.  They are now fine parents themselves.  I  believe it expresses very well the true meaning of Christ-mas. The review  from T. Liptak says it very well.  It puts Christ back into Christmas where  He belongs.  It was and still is one of very few videos that tell what  Christmas is about - the greatest gift of all to a sad and needy world -  the gift of Christ. that's why we celebrate Christ-mas."
4,"Compared to today's standards. this little cartoon is a bit old-fashioned. although I wouldn't use primitive as one review suggested.  It's an oldie. for sure. dating back to 1968. and it used to be one of those films you saw every year.The story is great. and the little drummer boy has to suffer many things before he comes face to face with the Holy Family and the Christ child. and he learns that his gift - the drum - is equally treasured.A marvelous film!!!"
4,"This is a sweet story. about a poor little drummer boy who can only offer a gift of song to the baby Jesus. Even toddlers are quick to notice the stop-action animation and the distinctive soundtrack that was recorded by the Vienna Boys Choir. Our toddler called it 'Camel' as he loved to see the dancing animals which of course included a dancing Camel.The cast features voices you will recognize;Jos&eacute; Ferrer  - Ben Haramed [Voice]The Vienna Boys ChoirPaul H. Frees  - [Voice]Greer Garson  - Storyteller [Voice]Ted Eccles  - [Voice]Jules Bass ad Arthur Rankin. Jr.  - Directed. Produced. and wrote this christmas classic.BOTTOM LINE: A Christmas Classic for the whole family that never wears out!"
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
4,"Despite one reviewer's comment. I think it is for children. as well as adults. because it brings back the true meaning of Christmas.  There's nothing 'scary' about the movie.  It's just a beautiful story that everyone. including children. can relate to in some way.I saw this movie when I was a young child and I never forgot it.  It had a huge impact on me in a great way.  It's a true Christmas classic. which is a rare thing."
4,"The collaborative work of Katherine Davis. Henry Onorati and harry Simeone. 'The Little Drummer Boy' is delightful retelling of a classic Christmas story and song wonderfully combined with the glowing. full-color illustrations of Ezra Jack Keats and the iconic music and vocals of John Jennings in superbly produced. flawlessly recorded. six-minute DVD format. A very highly recommended addition to family. school. and community library Christmas DVD collections. 'The Little Drummer Boy' is also available from Weston Woods in a Paperback/CD format (NPCD124. $18.95) and a Paperback/Cassette format (NPRA124. $14.95)."
4,"The Little Drummer Boy deserves a place alongside Rudolph and Frosty as one of Rankin Bass's vert best holiday classics. and where it may lack in eye candy and whimsy compared to other holiday favorites it more than makes up for it with a truly powerful and touching story. Now here's the sad part: the print master used for this DVD is absolutely horrible. especially in comparison to all the other Rankin Bass DVDs that have been released. I was shocked to see a picture quality that's inferior to even VHS recorded in SLP mode. Images are dark. murky. and full of scratches. I was even more shocked to see credit given to 3 people at the end for supposed 'film restoration.' How horrible must the unrestored print have been to get it up to sub-sub-par level? Sorry. but I don't buy it. This film deserves to be restored properly."
4,"This is one of the BEST RANKIN/BASS Specials!  It is heartwarming and shows the true spirit of CHRISTMAS.  Don't let anyone tell you that the material is too harsh for young children and it is still on TV during the Holidays.  This newest version of the DVD does not have the name RANKIN/BASS on the front cover as it should.  CLASSIC MEDIA should be ashamed of themselves.  This particular DVD also does not have the 35 mm print BUT this 16 A & B roll will have to suffice for now. since they have not found the 35mm print.  I Highly Recommend this DVD and I Highly Recommend that CLASSIC MEDIA/SONY WONDER give the proper credit on the next edition of this DVD."
4,"Just as the creators of HR Puffnstuff left a legacy to the children of the 60 and 70.s.Rankin Bass forever left some of the greatest treasures ever created.This Little Drummer Boy is not only a classic but can make you cry and get a lump in your throat every time you watch it.When the little Boys donkey is hit by a wagon he is rewarded by our lord who brings the donkey back to great health.if children today would watch these classics instead of watching the crap on tv or being on there cell phone at age 7 the world would be a much better place to live."
4,"This has always been and still is my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  I had it on VCR but had to switch over to DVD (probably have to switch again a decade or two from now).  I am in my 40's and still love to watch this very short movie at Christmas time.  With all of the advancements in animation these days. it is hard to convince my daughters that this is worth watching but it is the STORY that gets me every time.  They actually are learning to enjoy watching it with me."
4,"This is the 1968 by Rankin/Bass television special. The story is based on the Christmas song. The young boy Aaron. left orphaned when thieves invade his home. lives a life away from people. He has three dancing animal friends. the drum his parents gave him. and not much else. A greedy traveling showman exploits Aaron and his animals as a musical act. This dark story eventually turns and leads Aaron to the Three Wise Men and the journey to Bethlehem. Voice talent includes Greer Garson who narrates. Jose Ferrer as the showman (he sings too). Paul Frees as all three Wise Men. and the Vienna Boys' Choir singing the title song. one the best versions I've heard. I think with all the Frosty. Rudolph and Heat Miser your kids can watch. this would give them spiritual balance during the holiday."
4,"I remember watching The Little Drummer Boy on television as a child and was pleased to see that they are showing it on television during this Christmas season. The story is inspired by the evergreen Christmas song and the central character here is a little boy. an orphan who has lost his family in the most horrible way. This has resulted in his hatred and resentment toward others. and it is only through his musical abilities and his experience with the baby Jesus that his life changes for the better. The Little Drummer Boy learns that he does have something to give after all. in spite of his poverty. Greer Garson's narration is serious for the most part. yet also gentle. and Jose Ferrer also does a commendable job. This is a short animated feature and though its old-school animation may be out of date. the story remains a classic that is worthy of being shared with children and adults."
4,"Honestly. is there any holiday movies being made now that are better than these old classics?  I just love this one and I'm so thrilled that someone out there had enough sense to put these older ones on dvd and video for generations to come.  It's a real bummer during the holidays if you accidentally miss one on television - it doesn't come around again for another year so this definitely is a must.  I love Fred Astaire's narration of this and now you can even buy the matching toys to it!  How neat!  I about lost it when I found Fred Astaire and his little mail truck in the local Meijer's store the other day.  Way too cute. along with the snow monster. Mr. Warlock.  It's just a very cute way of showing how Santa first came about and even Mrs. Santa.  You can't miss with this story and it belongs in everyone's Christmas collection."
4,"I caught this on ABC-TV tonight as I was flicking the channels.  Every year at this time this airs.  I've seen it countless times over the years.  What else can be said?  It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better. more authentic. and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials. which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway. everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a &#34;prequel&#34; of sorts. telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle. the dungeon. and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.I highly recommend this Christmas classic over any CGI-animated piece of garbage they make today."
4,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Santa Claus is Comin' to town. It's a heartwarming story with tons of good & memorable characters with lots of great songs to boot. The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall. despite.some silly moments & plot holes.it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10."
4,"I loved this as a kid.  So I figured I'd get it for my kids.  And they liked it too. despite the hilariously hokey special effects (hokey to them). so that's why I gave it 3 stars.But for me. for all the christmas specials. this is the worst.I couldn't believe the 'Sit on my lap' song.  Really. Some strange creep comes to town and trades kisses and lap sitting for toys - he should have been arrested for that alone.And then the way they tied everything to the song was really irritating.  Plus. why did the young man have an old man's voice? Annoying."
4,"This is an enjoyable telling of how Santa Claus became who he is today. Keep in mind that this story is completely fabricated by the minds of Rankin/Bass. not the real history of how the myth of Santa Claus evolved. With that in mind. it is quite inventive.Where did he get his red suit?Why does he go down the Chimney?What about his reindeer and his 'Ho Ho Ho'?These questions and others are all answered as a young boy grows to manhood while a despotic mayor forbids toys of every kind in his town.It's not quite the same storytelling level as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. but it is done well enough."
4,"Wow. this Christmas classic answers all of the little ones' inevitable questions about the origin of Santa. the use of stockings. the use of a chimney. how reindeer fly. etc. In the middle of the main story is a villain. the Warlock. who is transformed from an evil figure to a good one as a result of Santa giving him a toy. Meanwhile. the mayor of Sombertown is determined to uphold his ban on toys. much to the chagrin of Jessica. who is falling in love with Kris Kringle (Santa). As always. the Rankin Bass specials aren't complete without a message; in this case. it's good defeating evil. goodwill and love over hate and persecution. The story is narrated by Fred Astaire. who does a fine job. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town stands as one of the true classics. and belongs in everyone's animated Chrustmas collection."
4,"The film has it's own value. but some people underestimate the work by the team that made all of these films. todays CGI animation is great but the quality of such recent CGI hits in theatres wouldn't be there if this team never existed. The blazed the trail the same way Lewis and Clark blazed the trail across the united states and the work in all these films proves it because of how the stand the test of time. Besides. the cast of these films in beyond stellar they are legendary. Not &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF TTHE BOARD&#34; was in one along with other ledgends and if it's good for &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD&#34; it perfect for my household."
4,"This is probably the best animated Christmas story of all and definitely one of the most remembered. Who can forget about Sam the Snowman. Herbie (I want to be a dentist). Yukon Cornelius. the Abominable Snow Monster. and of course. Rudolph. I have watched this every year for at least the last 25 years. But now I don't have to check the TV Guide to find out when it's coming on. I can watch it whenever I want. When I was young. I used to wonder if my toys talked (wonder if this is where Toy Story got their idea). A perfect family movie that will make you laugh. cry. and be a little frightened. Excellent is all I have left to say."
4,"If you like Christmas movies besides 'The Nightmare before Christmas'. you should add this one to your collection. If you don't like Christmas movies then buy 'The Grinch' or 'The Christmas Carol' and see what you act like Grinch/Scrooge. In my humble opinion this is the best telling of Rudolph's story in a musical. Many added side stories with Hermey the dentist. Yukon Cornelius. Abominible Snowman. and the Island of Misfit Toys adds to make a great story. The animated figures are excellent and smooth motioned. Excellent narration by Burl Ives. The music is first rate and will have the family singing along."
4,"WOW this is a DVD?!?The show is as it was in the TV release and the extras do bring it to the modern day but I think they (Sony Wonder/Golden Books) could have packed all the shows on One DVD instead of making you buy  3 of them... Look to Warmer Bros. Year w/o Santa Claus...Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Frosty could have made it all in this DVD... Well I got it in the collection and saved some over buying them one at a time...Enjoy the show and worry where the popcorn money will come from later..."
4,"What makes this little film so special is so varied and precious. that it's hard to identify one area.  Of course Rudolph is the main character. as is his little girlfriend.  Then there's Burl Ives. who narrates it. and the wonderful music of Johnny Marks.  I perform his music every year. it's so upbeat and inspirational.  That he was asked to write the music for this movie was no surprise.The animation is a little dated. but the kids won't mind.  You won't find this kind of movie made anymore.  It has so many nice qualities. not to mention Santa and his elves. and the Isle of Misfit Toys. and the 'Bumble.' and Cornelius of the Yukon.I laugh as I think of all this. and it's a sweet smile. and a great film for Christmas!!!"
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
4,"This is one of those Christmas movies that you can't get through the holiday season without seeing at least once. The animation is charming and the story a classic one... This movie is a sad/sweet Christmas story that usually makes me want to cry. Why couldn't they just accept Rudolph?All about the greatness of Santa's most famous reindeer and how his 'UNUSUAL' abilitys came to use one Christmas Eve you can't help but love this small misfit little reindeer and neither can Santa.Their is something magical and charming about this classic Christmas story that makes kids believe and adults wish that they could. This is definately one of those Christmas movies that WILL never go out of style and will be around for generations. Definately a movie that you should buy if you have children or grandchildren- they'll enjoy this Christmas classic as much as you will..."
4,"'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' is an enchanting classic narrated by Burl Ives that kept my full attention as a child and is still wonderful to watch. Rudolph encounters rejection from friends and family and runs away from home when he is fortunate to meet Hermey. an elf who longs to be a dentist. and Yukon Cornelius. a gruff miner looking for gold. On their way. they sail to the Island of Misfit Toys promising to let Santa know of their neglected existence. After a horrible storm threatens visibility. Christmas is almost 'canceled' until Santa discovers Rudolph's shiny nose.Catchy Christmas songs and animation makes 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' a wonderful addition to anyone's movie collection!"
4,"As I watch this movie for over the 50th time. have to laugh more and more. The movie is fun. yet have to wonder how Santa tolerated the elf and reindeer bullying. Reindeer tease poor Rudolf because of his nose. The elves tease poor Herbie because he doesn't want to make toys. and the head elf makes him work through his ten minute break. a true labor law violation.The Land of Misfit Toys is quite the site. can't help but to blame the elves for such mistakes. And why santa never knew about this place. since he knows everything and everyplace.The Abominable Snowman is more funny than scary. and is very entertaining.Always a classic and the flaws in the plot have holes bigger than the Grand Canyon. but that adds to the fun.A great way to enjoy a night by the fireplace with the family and friends."
4,"We were finally able to put the RANKIN/BASS name w/ a photo cover THANKS to Alexander Drosin and the kind folks at GOLDEN BOOKS and SONY WONDER!  The Extras on here were much needed and give the consumer much more for their $.  You would think that companies that release DVDs of this kind would naturally include extras BUT sometimes your assumption could be wrong....THANKFULLY not here.  Hopefully. we will be able to add more material (Check part II of my TVPARTY.com article) and I will certainly discuss all the material in my new book &quot;The Making of RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER:  The Longest Running. Highest-Rated TV Special in History.&quot;  Visit us at RANKINBASS.com for more info and BUY this DVD!  This will send the companies that make these DVDs a message.....MORE EXTRAS! and PHOTO covers!  Rick Goldschmidt"
4,"I spent many Christmas seasons of my childhood waiting for Santa and watching this movie.  Having it in my collection now will rekindle all of those happy thougths and make the Christmas season all the brighter as I will not have to wait for it to show up on my television.The story is a simple. sweet tale of frienship. trust. and overcoming problems.  It shows how to have confidence in yourself and be able to help others in the same situation.  Everyone has a place in society regardless of how they look (Rudoplh. misfit toys) or what they do (Herbie. the elf who wants to be a dentist).The animation is amazing when you realize that this is not computer generated.  It had to be done by hand. frame by frame.  That alone makes this a classic in the art of entertainment."
4,"The 'mother' of all classic kids Christmas tales. and this series just moves at the brisk pace of Santa's sleigh on Xmas eve. While other similar shows seem to have parts to allow time to run errands in the home between 'good scenes'. this show snaps it's melodic fingers. and makes you drop the tablecloth. A very warm. engaging. and wonderful cast with songs that actually hit the charts by other famous singers. make this one and only of it's kind. A family adventure for the ages. and then some. Burl Ives makes his grand entrance ala singing snowman. and ties the story of Rudolph's troubles all together. One more thing. for a puppet. that Santa is pretty darn convincing. Rudolph's friend. and fellow misfit elf Herbie. is also a unique character all his own. The sets are nothing short of dazzling. and the effects just add to the atmosphere. without distracting or looking out of context. Excellent all the way-ho. ho. ho!"
4,"I was 12 years old when Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer had its premiere. and there have only been a few instances where I've missed the annual showing of this holiday classic. The DVD version I purchased--which incorporated several edited sections. as well as a &quot;variant&quot; song--literally brought tears to my eyes.  Not only was the print pristine in every way. I hadn't realized just how heavily edited Rudolph had become! To see it in its original form is a real treat--and I highly recommend purchasing this remarkable DVD to anyone who appreciates Christmas nostalgia.  Why wait till the Yuletide season? With this gorgeous DVD. it can snow year-round!"
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
4,"Yes. it is I. the Edit Avenger!!Here to protect freedom and original art from plunderous corporations and soulless individuals!!!!If you are considering purchasing a 2004 or later release of 'Rudolph'. think twice. It is edited.I just ordered the original 2002 UNEDITED/no Destiny's Child 'Rudolph' DVD from eBay express. I got it sealed for $6.99 + $3 shipping.Do NOT buy edited DVDs when you can avoid it. Let's send the message. If you don't think that you make a difference remember this:Consumer complaints about the edits in 'Beavis and Butthead Mike Judge Collection Vol 1' were 100% of the reason that volumes 2 and 3 were released with absolutely NO edits whatsoever to the material.Good for us!Edits are for losers!I have spoken."
4,"As I sat with my precious 4 year old granddaughter and watched this video one more time. I smiled.This is one of those movies that you share with each little one that comes into your life.Watching her eyes glow as the story unfolded brought me such joy; and listening to her trying to remember all the reindeer names brough a chuckle.How could anyone not love this classic? It will be a tresure to share with every generation.  If you have not seen it. which would be hard to believe. I highly recommend it.  Wonderful"
4,"Okay. so I'm reliving the past with this classic... And classic it is. If you're a sap over the holidays. and still expect the jolly big dude. to be coming down your chimney on Christmas eve. then this is a video for you.As a matter of fact. three of recent Santa Clause movies that really get me into the spirit are the Tim Allen movies by Disney: The Santa Clause 1. 2. and 3. Great movies (along with this classic) to watch on a cold Winter's night...The Santa Clause"
4,"The story: priceless.  Rudolph the outcast becomes Rudolph the celebrated.The songs: timeless.  Burl Ives crooning in his warm voice makes this winer wonderland a cozy place to hang out.The animation: creative.  Eclectic.  They don't make them like this any more and that's too bad.  From the salt used as water fizzle to the black gum drop used as Rudolph's temporary nose this movie has more charm that a 100 CGI flicks.The characters: relatable and wild.  From the elf that wants to be a dentist instead of a toymaker to that great. white terrifying furball to Yukon Cornelius and his taste for snow.Nice extras on the Golden Books/ Sony distributed DVD.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas and let Rudolph's nose help it be bright!"
4,"Let's face it: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer has been an iconic symbol of the American-made stop-motion animated Christmas special. This 1964 classic carries a special message of forgiveness and kindness. as a tormented Rudolph finds his place in the world after having run away from his peers. Seeing what their actions did to poor Rudolph. they come to accept him as an equal. and perhaps admire his gift of a shiny nose that saved Christmas. Burl Ives is the perfect narrator. who sings two signature Christmas songs. SILVER AND GOLD and HOLLY JOLLY CHRISTMAS. This special has all the right sights and sounds for its kind. Do yourself a favor and purchase this DVD for a nostalgic look at the origin of the stop-motion television Christmas special."
4,"A tape or DVD of this show should be owned by every family in America. The level of care and loving craftsmanship seen here is something we are likely never to see again in the production of a film or show for children.This is demonstrated most of all. of course. in the music.'Silver and Gold'. 'Holly Jolly Christmas'. 'We Are Santa's Elves'.'There's Always Tomorrow'. 'The Most Wonderful Day of the Year'(whose eyes can stay dry through that one?) - all original compositions with full orchestral and choral accompaniment for a single TV show!For generations now. 'it isn't Christmastime until 'Rudolph' comes on'. Even if the networks give up airing it. I know my family will be cueing up this video every year the calendar's page is turned to December - I hope your family will be too."
4,"Underdog was one of my favorites when I was five years old. and watching the DVD reissues brought back wonderful memories. I ordered these for my son who is five years old as a means of obtaining quality programming in the English language. We are living in Germany where Underdog is relatively unknown. My son was fascinated by the episodes. watching them with wonderful childlike awe. not bored at all. And I enjoyed the occasional references to the adult world (Lucitanic. Hopeless Diamond. etc.). I'm glad I ordered this set.Before ordering I checked the Amazon customer ratings of the individual DVDs. I. too. think it's a shame that the cliffhanger episodes were spliced together. This takes away some of the series' charm. for those familiar with the original format. But there's so much charm going around in this that it almost doesn't matter. Therefore I chose to give five stars. If another packaged set comes out next year I'll probably order it. as well."
4,"I grew up in the 1970s. and I have a lot of great memories of watching &quot;Underdog&quot; on TV.Unfortunately. the people who made this DVD have chosen chose to deliberately ruin the cartoons. Apparently. the cliffhanger endings that were in the original require too much of an attention span for today's Ritalin addicted audience. and so these segments have been deleted. Other parts of the cartoon have also been tampered with. And what happenend to Tennessee Tuxedo and other characters that I could have sworn were part of the original show?I love classic animation. but because of the various alterations that were made for this DVD. I cannot recommend it to anyone. in any way. for any reason."
4,"When I was just a little boy. my heart was filled with glee whenever my friend Underdog appeared on my TV.  From lovable. humble shoeshine boy to dynamic flying hound. no better television show for childhood could be found.  Now that I am older. I find (oh happy glee) that Underdog can once again be seen on my TV.  This Collector's Set Edition. so carefully restored. can once again be purchased. to view or just to hoard. But I have a niece and nephew. ages four and six. just about the age to love this canine's cartoon tricks.  I think that they will be amazed and find it quite sublime to make friends with an Underdog who lyrically fights crime.  So let's lift a toast to Underdog. a hero for all time. and I hope you will forgive me for reviewing this in rhyme."
4,"Did I miss something that the other reviewers saw? Or did I get a defective DVD set? This set would have been alot better if Classic Media kept Underdog as the original TV series. Each Underdog episode was initially shown as a serial with cliff-hangers. In between each cliffhanger was a short like Tennesse Tuxedo. What Classic Media did was to run each episode in one complete uninterrupted showing. This takes away from the original series' charm. The &quot;Cliffhanger episodes&quot; are banished into the features section which is a shame because the cliffhangers are classics in and among themselves. The features would have been better if they interviewed some of the actors such as Don Adams or even some of the people involved with the production such as Howard Stern's father. Ben. Instead you get co-creator Joe Harris' creepy account of a never before seen Underdog episode written for two girls."
4,"WOW!Underdog is one of those shows that doesn't get nearly the attention it deserves.  It's been decades since I've seen or heard anything about the show.  As such. I was surprised at all the little gems hidden in these classic shows.  I loved seeing things like Simon Barsinister 'The meanest man in the world'. creating machines to help him 'rule the world'.  Do you remember some of them?  Like his machine designed to shrink everyone in the world to 6 inches tall?  'With my new shinking gun. I'll be the tallest man in the world!'It was great re-living those great memories again."
4,"ANOTHER American cultural icon from the 60's has beendeemed unacceptable by those who would prefer to seemalice where none exists.Not even Underdog can escape the slings and arrows ofthose with the same mentality as the book-burners of1930's Germany.Why do we allow such obvious Orwellian 'Newsspeak' toedit our past? Come on... this IS a cartoon. for Pete'ssake. NOT some social/political statement.Nothing here needs to be edited or 'cleaned up'. Theseare simple 'good vs. evil' stories with a happy ending.and should be offered in their entirety... music/songs.credits and all.And. if one is offended by ANY of this... then one mayexorcise one's freedom NOT to purchase such!Nuff' said..."
4,"Love seeing these cartoons in PERFECT re-mastered condition and bright colors.  Over the years. they have aired on channels including CARTOON NETWORK in washed out 16mm prints.  I would have preferred that the original titles remain. BUT at least they did put the original open to the series for each UNDERDOG episode.  All in all...a GREAT DVD set!  For this box set. CLASSIC MEDIA also re-did the covers for VOLUME 1 &amp; 2 and they are much IMPROVED!  Rick Goldschmidt  RANKIN/BASS Historian"
4,"It's a bird. it's a plane. it's...UNDERDOG!Wow. I had forgotton about this cartoon (except for those special appearnces at the Macy's  Thanksgiving Day Parade).  so imagine my delight when it was anounced that  UNDERDOG would be released on DVD.  This disc features a compilation of  Underdog episodes including rarely-seen episodes thought to be long lost.  And. for those dedicated UNDERDOG fans only. I heard a rumor that a $49.95  edition limited to just 1.000 copies will include a lithograph created by  Joe Harris. the original illustrator. especially created for the DVD.  For  the rest of us not willing to spend the cash. this regular edition will do  just fine."
4,"Julia is delightful. as always. However. the cooking here is very basic and rather repetitive. In the meat section. you learn how to pan fry a steak and how to deglaze the pan and make a sauce. Then you have essentially the same thing for a pork chop and a veal cutlet. You learn how to make a pot roast. followed by the same instructions but with chunks of meat to make beef stew. In the vegetable section. you learn how to boil various vegetables and finish them off with a dab of butter. Very basic. Lots of butter. heavy cream. and wine or vermouth added to almost every dish. The videography is not very well-lit for close-ups. so some of the food looks rather unappealing. I think this would be useful for someone who wants to cook basic American food and only knows how to microwave. But if you are already buying fresh ingredients and putting meals on the table. this will not really teach you much."
4,"This is a very basic cooking dvd. which I think is good for everyone. even if it's just a review.  I don't consider myself a novice cook. but I even got some techniques and tips from it.  I think just being in the presence of Julia is a good thing. like her teaching continues even though she is still not with us.The quality of my dvd's are just fine. not sure why that other reviewer had issues with the quality.  I wish Julia had done a series of vidoes.  Now you can only get a few of the old episodes of her French Chef cooking show.  Guess they didn't think of it back then.This is a great video for beginners and I think a great price. under $11."
4,"Cooking was a haphazard skill for me until I read Julia Child's 'The Way to Cook.' There are thousands of books that teach recipes. but very few about techniques. That is where Mrs. Child breaks from most cooking instructors and where she leaves an important mark.By explaining. quickly and simply. the most useful methods in the preparations of foods. she makes clear. with positive attitude. enthusiasm and reassurance. how the novice cook can prepare meals expertly.The accompanying video series. now on DVD. does not have all the recipes listed in the book (that would take years to go through). but the techniques are all here. well organized and easy to master. I recommend both these videos and the book itself. for the latter goes into deeper details on how the theme-and-variation approach to recipes helps demystify cooking.Julia Child made a significant difference in my life. I am forever grateful to America's First Lady of Food for patiently teaching me the way to cook."
4,"As a devoted Julia Child fan I am very impressed with this DVD of Ms. Julia cooking EVERYTHING! The DVD is very user friendly. easy to navigate and beautiful in it's simplicity yet astounding in the amount of basic cooking techniques demonstrated! There are nearly 60 recipes on each of the Discs. The recipe booklet included with the 2 DVD Set is fantastic. Seeing each recipe come together- step by step - 'live and in living color' is extremely helpful along with knowing what the end result is supposed to look like! I can only wish I had had such a resource when I was a novice cook over 40 yrs ago! What a wonderful gift idea for a bridal shower. new college student or housewarming for a newbie starting out on their own.The Way To Cook DVDI never tire of listening to Julia's distinctive voice and watching her friendly. non-fru-fru mannerisms coupled with her impeccable class as a lady. a chef and an instructor. Once again dear Julia- Bravo. Bravo. BRAVO INDEED!"
4,"I think it's great that the popularity of a recent film (Julie & Julia) has once again brought Julia Child into the spotlight.  When this series first aired in the mid 80's. I remember watching it to learn the essentials of food preparation and short cuts.  The very day I found out it was available. I immediately preordered.This two DVD set comes with an instructional booklet.  On the first. you will find Poultry. Meats and Vegetables.  On the second. Soups. Salads and Bread. Fish and Eggs. and First Courses and Desserts.  Both DVDs are well chaptered. so if you just want to watch one particular sub-chapter. you don't have to sift through an entire topic in order to do so.  As always. Julia is instructive. professional and completely enthusiastic.  Buy this now (together with the companion bookThe Way to Cook) and. if you haven't already. also get the newly releasedBaking With Julia"
4,"This is not a teaching; this is an act as in action. The film's base on the Stations of the Cross; creates a Passion Play of great power. It's as close to a time machine as you might get; being plunged into another time zone. Sweet and rougher than usual; it's a great film to see. More horrific also; but redemptive.Blu-ray shows the great design and photography; as well as a powerful soundtrack. Two versions and chapters that reflect the stations. plus a DVD"
4,"The acting was fine. but I fail to see the point. We've got a guy with a thorny crown. covered with blood. hauling a cross. He falls down. Evil Roman soldiers beat him for falling down. He gets up and hauls it some more. He falls down again. They beat him again. Etc. I just don't understand why we need to see anyone. Jesus Christ or anybody else. taking such an ass kicking. What was it. 90 minutes out of 100? We need some more story here. Mel. I was glad when Jesus died so I could change the channel. Oh. there was a brief resurrection. Two seconds. sunlight through a hole in his hand. Michael resisting the urge to make a horrible joke about eating M&Ms this close to Easter Sunday."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
4,"I wanted to watch in the privacy of my own home instead of a theater with others.  This is a private thing and an individual faith issue.  I was very curious and wanted to be impartial. I heard about the graphic's and a lot of reviews against MG and wanted to see for myself first. TOTALLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!! I talked to a fellow congragation member just tonight because of all of the questions going thru my head & heart.  Then I found & printed the Catholic mystic from another viewer & I TY very much.  I'm gonna look that up!  I was under the impression it was all from the 4 Gospels & now I know better. Now I'm waiting for the collectors edition whenever it is released!!"
4,"'The Passion of the Christ' is a deeply moving masterpiece. It is entirely faithful to the spirit and. within the bounds of artistic license. the letter of the Gospel narratives. It contains not the slightest trace of anti-Semitic influence or message. Charges that it does are not merely false; they are slanderous.  Focusing narrowly and excruciatingly on His passion. this may not be the right movie to lead someone to Christ. but it is the right movie to lead a Christian back to the profound. piteous. inescapable truth at the heart of his faith: that God endured unimaginable suffering and death for my sins. and for yours."
4,"I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously. because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time."
4,"Well this is one of the best gore movies I have ever seen. Pretty much that is what this movie is. 2 hours of a man being beaten and tortured. Ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and any Romero film. I actually was laughing near the end of it because of how over the top this movie is. How anyone can get a religious experience out of this is beyond me. Not to mention how hypocritical the religious nuts are to say they condemn violence yet they love this movie. Well if you are a horror film fan who appreciates good make up and gore then this ranks up there with some of the best. Who would have thunk that Mel Gibson would make one the goriest violent films of all time that would appeal to two different groups. As far as content goes and story line. this is not the movie for you. There is nothing of substance here. nope just two hours of beatings and torture."
4,"I'd like to give this movie a dozen stars. While I can not say I enjoyed it as entertainment. I've never seen a more powerful movie. GOD LOVES ME. screams from every second of film. It left me wishing I was less of a sinner. so that maybe just one less lash might have fallen. There is violence. but the love that made the violence necessary offsets it. It's life changing. I hate violence. I hate subtitles. as a protestant. I didn't get the Marian symbols. but I loved this movie. I prefer vhs to dvd. but this is one I want to dvd to get every bit of everything about the movie. Don't read the da vinci code. watch this movie. That's what Christ is about. not some half witted attempt to make Him less of who He is."
4,"It was a bummer finding myself looking at subtitles.  I also did not experience in the fervent passion and zeal that the movie was supposedly causing.I think the hype is a bit much for the product.I'd advise you not to have 'treats' or a meal as you watch this movie.  We need to remember that Caligula was mad for eating and watching gore at the same time.  This movie is pure ancient Roman gore.  This can't be too far of a cry from what Caligula enjoyed watching as he sat in his personal home eating and munching.A decent parent would never allow their child to see this movie.  It is the stuff Caligula had watched as a child and we know how he turned out.  It's unnerving to think of how many 'Boots' sat out in those movie theaters. and how many are now sitting in the livingroom with  'mummsy and dahdah.' I mean we're talking graphic angles of torture devices on the skin as never before seen etc."
4,"I was raised Catholic and still am a Catholic as I go to mass now ever Sunday even though I didnt go for awhile in my early 20's. I left the theater feeling like a bad Mary Magedeline. It was a great movie though but not great that you want to watch it over and over. The androgynous Satan was really creepy. I felt like the bad Catholic that I have been after watching this. As a kid I used to like going to 'The stations of the cross' events at the church during Easter but this is so graphic all it did was make me feel like a bad Catholic and that I need to go to confession really bad."
4,"The TRUTH is that Christianity offers a solution to those who have problems in life. Christianity is not the same as catholicism or related with the bad things done for over the centuries by the catholic church - like the evangelisation and slavery to the native people of different continents such as Africa and America's and the Holy Inquisition!It IS Universal! The Laws of Christ are the laws that we - who live in a democratic and free country - still use! If Jesus have died to save the problems of mankind we should be must be thankfull in the year of the Lord 2005! Still His Birthday for us to remember! Always!The meaning of this Mel Gibson's masterpiece is based on the universal message of Christ!"
4,"This movie was very hard to watch because His death WAS very ugly. yet I personally believe it to be accurate with what the Bible says.Although I don't know all the beliefs in all the Religions.I have read the Gospels in the Bible. and it seemed the movie played out just as the Bible read.The movie only focuses on the last 12 hours of Christ's earth life.And although it is hard to watch. It's a great reminder of the Gift that was given to us all.The performances are nothing less than spectacular. and I found this movie to be deeply touching."
4,"Mel Gibson's movies often involve torture. usually of Mel himself. It's pointless to speculate on the source of Gibson's self-loathing and contempt. but being raised as a fundamentalist. anti-Semitic catholic may have something to do with it. Mel's psychopathology is taken to its ultimate extreme in this lengthy. plotless. graphic depiction of torture. There is no plot. no spirituality. no message. just an innocent man being flayed. It is blatant Sadean voyeurism using a mask of religion to conceal the fact that its creator is sick. sick sick. It is revealing that this movie was so popular in a country that would elect another sick. ignorant fundamentalist for its President."
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half-deluded gospel scenes.Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church.Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
4,"Without a doubt I was totally shocked.  The scenes involving Christ being whipped and smacked around were just... too much.  To be completely honest. I thought the amount of violence that poor Jesus had to go through during his final moments was too much to withstand.  The movie is basically one scene involving lots of pain for Jesus right after another. and it gets to the point after a while where it all becomes extremely disturbing.The wide screen picture quality is perhaps a bit *too* wide (since there's more black above and below the actual picture on screen compared to most movies) and having to read text throughout the movie because none of the characters spoke in english was another small complaint (but I understand the developers were going for absolute realism here. hence the controvery surrounding the film).Just shocking the way Jesus was treated."
4,"There was so much speculation before 'The Passion of the Christ' opened. and I truly believe the naysayers were just blowing smoke.  Yes. it is a very violent movie. but not gratuitous Hollywood violence.  After all. bludgeoning and cuxifiction are both extreme acts of violence and suffering and this is what is depicted in the movie.  Mel Gibson did an excellent job.  I would not recommend this movie for youngsters due to the violence.  Very mature young teens may be able to handle it."
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
4,"This is a 'graphic' portrayal of the last 12 hours of Christ's life on Earth. It is inconceivable that any human could endure the physical trauma/torture/abuse inflicted by the Romans. Perhaps that was a major point intended by the film-maker(s). It is hard for anyone to know exactly what all transpired during those twelve hours. but this movie does a good job of mixing speculation with scripture creating an intense 2 hours of entertainment. Great sets and performances. Speaking in Aramaic and Italian added a bit more credibility but required the viewer to read subtitles which interferes with watching the action. It would be great if there were an English language dubbed version to watch. Jim Caviezel's performance was awesome."
4,"Many hate it. many love it and never will everybody agree to disagree. So. here's my view which only means something to me. You can say what you want about Mel Gibson but he really nailed it here. This story. so simple in it's broad. cinematic release simply tells the tale of Jesus. a simple spiritual giant who came. taught. and was killed because of these teachings. More importantly. throughout the movie we are shown how to pray properly and the true battle of good and evil (which is really harmless if we know this). All through the movie. we see the demons. Satan. the snake taunting Jesus and the important aspect here is how Jesus handled this. He gave no thought to evil and gave it no power. hence giving it no life. In the end. the metaphysical message is clear. if only we open our eyes."
4,"The passsion is the best movie about JESUS. It is far better than those syrpy bible movies insstead of ignoring the cruelty of the time it shows it in graphic detail. Jim cavezi is better in theJesus role than any one. the beatings are grusome  the crusifiicsion  is brutal with every detail shown. one inaccuracy is the damage to the templle the Bible says the curtain between the people and the highpreist was torn nothing else. the passion is the best if you havent seen it get it or rent it."
4,"Mel Gibson is an ok actor but his real talent is directing and movies like THE PASSION OF CHRIST or APOCALYPTO prove it. BRAVEHEART was quite good. too. but he's outdone himself with THE PASSION OF CHRIST.First of all. using Aramaic instead of English - thank you! Brilliant and brave idea!Secondly. casting Jim Caviezel as Jesus. stroke of a genius. this actor is absolutely believable in his role.And finally not shunning away from EXCESSIVE and prolonged violence. Think what you will of onscreen violence. but in this film it's a must. Christ's suffering and his sacrifice do not come across as well without these violent scenes. which is why other movies about the crucifixion are not as powerful as Gibson's film.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is definitely not for children and without the religious context this would have most definitely been an NC-17."
4,"So many well-meaning Christians have found something to like about this film that I. a lifelong film buff but also a Christian. hesitate to express my views. Alas. I find little about this film that is likeable or meritable.First. the makeup and prosthetics were lamentably bad! The film had the feel of a concoction. For me. it lacked depth. gravity. artistic impact. rather like watching someone paint by numbers. or else place ingredients into a jar and shake them up. hoping they will come out arranged in some artistically rewarding order. Where was the inspiration?The one scene I liked- and I liked it very much- was when Jesus was at home and working as a carpenter. It boded so well...Alternatives? 'Jesus' starring Brian Deacon. or even the silent 'King of Kings'- neither of which is unimpeachable. but both of which are preferable."
4,"Full of blood and gore but lacking any real sense of majesty. glory or spirituality.  Obviously the intention was to show the reality of what Christ endured. giving us a better appreciation of his sacrifice.  For devout Christians. I can understand how they might bring their own sense of faith and &#34;passion&#34; to the intensity of what's being shown.  But as a film. and as a historical account. it expressed a lot of pain and agony but not a great deal of depth.  I don't believe for one second Mel Gibson was inspired by God to make this. and that kind of talk is just crazy fanaticism.  Visually. the movie looked very closed in and confined. when there should've been a feeling of expansiveness.  &#34;Braveheart&#34; was more inspiring and epic than this. which shouldn't be the case.  In fact. I was more moved by Jesus Christ Superstar than &#34;The Passion.&#34;"
4,"First I would like to say thank you to Mel Gibson.  You have delivered the most powerful movie that I have ever seen.  Even with all of the controversy. you have stood by your film and I salute your commitment and passion for your work and your faith.This is an amazing movie.  Yes. there are very many appalling scenes of Jesus being beaten and crucified.  This movie made me tear up in many parts. especially when Jesus saw his mother Mary and gained strength. after a brutal lashing. to continue carrying his cross to his eventual death.  This movie really made me realize one thing.  Any time that I feel as though I am sacrificing alot. I will think back on the punishment Jesus recieved for our sins and realize how ridiculous I am."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
4,"I just saw that Amazon is starting this new group of reviews. while it changed the other DVD reviews (to VHS - even though it was for a DVD too...come on. it was only a little over a year ago...). For what reason? There are almost 2.000 great reviews of this movie (on average). but that is not represented here. I think the public will want to know. also.It's a shame people are so ready to tear down a person who has made a mistake. rather than trying to show understanding and forgiveness. 'He who is without sin. cast the first stone.' Lots of stones being thrown here. and I for one. do not appreciate it."
4,"Since I have accept Him as my Lord and Savior. This movie was able to remind what He went through for me. How great His love is. Even when I have people who hate me. I should be thankful that I don't have to go through what Christ went through for me. Its starts at the garden where Judas betrays Him. to his trial where their is an emotional scene for me. to him carrying to the cross. to his death. I cried so much more than I cried watching the movie in theaters. I love Jesus.John 3:16 ' For God so loved the world that He gave His only son so that whoever believes in Him willn't perish but have eternal life.:"
4,"this movie. in a very graphic way. shows how CHRIST died at the hands of violent people who did not  know who he was. but JESUS  was willing to endure his fate..when i think of my children it is so hard to understand GODS deep love for his children. that he gave his only BEGOTTEN SON. i am so glad that he loves us that much.....a wonderful movie. it is very heart wretching and someone with a heart condition should be very careful when they watch it.....mell gibson is my most favorite director................"
4,"As someone who has read a few books about the physical suffering Jesus went through. I was amazed at how real the physical events were portrayed in this movie; almost like Mel Gibson took a time machine and filmed the crucifixion as it took place.  Now if we could only build a time machine to send the critics back in time.Even non-JesusFreaks should admit this movie was filmed to perfection.Every actor was great.  Every scene captivating.  Every word. needed.  Not only was this a great movie. it is fact.  The most real FACT there has ever been.  The man (God) on that cross took those nails for all of us...even those that dare reject His sacrifice.  Buy this movie and share it with friends - believers and non-believers.God Bless!(...)"
4,"There's so much debate about the violence of this movie that it may scare some from watching it. But Mel Gibson makes it known that he doesn't want to elaborate on the physical suffering of Jesus as much as he wants to elaborate on the courage and strength of Jesus to do God's will. Seeing him tremble and Pray to God made me feel closer to Jesus in that we know what torture and suffering he would face. The fact that we see Jesus as Human in those last hours is what makes the whole Movie moving. There are scenes that will make a person cringe. But the last scene of Jesus resurrection gives hope and almost purges those feelings of despair. This movie depicts true Love and Hope through even the most darkest hours. Other than some rather cheesy scenes and some overdramatic irony the movie should remain a classic for it's indie aspirations and block buster accomplishments."
4,"This depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ is certainly powerful.  For many. myself included. the crucifixion of Christ had become little more than a part of the window dressing of Christianity.  The familiar images of a Caucasian Christ on the cross had lost their power to horrify. and in turn had lost their power to communicate the suffering and sacrifice that lie at the heart of the central event of the Christian faith.  Director Mel Gibson restores its terrible. gritty reality.  This is a fully human Jesus that experiences unimaginable torment. not a primarily spiritual being existing above the mortal plane who is merely going through the motions for the benefit of mankind.  I am not a Christian. but I feel that I have gained a greater appreciation and understanding of the Christian faith for having seen this film.  This is not a film to 'enjoy.' but it is a powerful experience that has something to offer to anyone with an open mind."
4,"I needed strong drink to wash my mouth out after sitting through POTC. the most distasteful film I've ever seen.  The only benefit from watching it was the sense of duty to warn others off. Like incinerating an insect under a magnifying glass. Gibson accentuates a few verses in the story of the last week of Jesus into a gruesome. disgusting. gratuitous gorefest.  Maybe it helps one's appreciation to believe that Jesus died for our sins (which I don't). but even in that case. I don't think that Gibson's relentless portrayal of violence adds much to the magic."
4,"AT FIRST I DID NOT WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIEIT WAS NOT IN ENGLISH AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BORINGWHEN I SAW THIS MOVIE IT DID NO ONLY TEACH ME ALOT BUT OPEN MY EYES TO ALOT OF THINGS.THE MOVIE IS ABOUT THE LAST DAYS OF CHRISTCHRIST IS PUT THREW SOME HORRIBLE THINGS THAT NO MAN ON EARTHCOULD STAND UP TONOT ONLY DID HE GO THREW THESE THINGS HE PRAYED FOR THE MEN THAT WAS DOING THEM TO HIM.WHILE I WAS WATCHING THIS MOVIE I DID NOT FEEL LIKE I WASWATCHING A MOVIE IN SUB TITLES IT FELT LIKE I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING WITHOUT READING THE SUB TITLES.FOR EVERY ONE THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ALL"
4,"Mel Gibson's epic masterpiece is the feel good hit of the summer! Tina Turner shines in her role as Mary (especially in the memorable scene where she defiantly sings 'Better Be Good To Me' while pleading her case before Pilate (a never funnier Adam Sandler!) and the casting of Bobcat Goldthwaite as Jesus is pure genius. Gibson's decision to have the cast speak the entire dialog in Esperanto points to his trademark attention to historical accuracy and detail! The DVD is jam-packed with extras...an entire brownshirt uniform and a miniature replica of 'Mein Kampf' that you can read to the kids before bedtime! Hands down the best anti-Semitic propaganda film since Leni 'Oh c'mon. it's just a movie!' Reifenstahl's 'Triumph of the Will'! An excellent distraction from the war in Iraq and the 2004 election! Two steins up!!"
4,"'The Passion of the Christ' was one of the most controversial. famous. talked about films of the year 2004.  It was the cause for a lot of stir even before it was released.  Most people fail to realize all of that doesn't matter because Jesus Christ never existed!!  Jesus Christ is a mythological figure the church has exploited for hundreds of years and now the filmmaking industry has for almost a hundred years.  There is absolutely no archeological or historical evidence that Jesus Christ existed.  Even if he did exist. it would be highly unlikely he would have received that kind of punishment.It is a shame a con artist like Mel Gibson is using this mythological character to make millions of dollars.  People have to start swaying away from the manipulations of the church and the filmmaking industry and start looking at the hard facts.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ never happened and the so-called messiah never existed."
4,"I can't find this film moving in any degree. It is disturbingly graphic but not in an entertaining way (e.g. Pulp Fiction) or in a way that shakes the viewer's consciousness (e.g. the Grey Zone). Instead it presents a deeply dogmatic and outdated view of the final days of Jesus.  I am non religious yet I have seen films that opened the minds of viewers on the subject of Jesus from The Last Temptation of Christ to The Gospel According to Saint Matthew to Jesus of Montreal. What we have here instead is Mel Gibson's Birth of a Nation with a disturbing ideology that was savagely and appropriately lampooned on South Park's 'The Passion of the Jew' (kudos to Blockbuster for putting the two titles for rent next to each other)."
4,"I found the first half of the film to be very interesting and well done. Fine acting and production values.  Then it turned into an S&M porno movie.  The whippings with both the canes and the metal tipped whips caused me to fast forward through most of that scene.  It was gratuitous and I could just see the S&M set buying this dvd just to pleasure themselves while watching it. The other thing that bothered me throughout was the fact that the score from Jesus Christ Superstar kept running through my head as I watched it. I would give the movie around 4-5 stars if the quality of the story telling had lived up the the first half for the entire film."
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
4,"My review will not be nearly as sophisticated as some of the ones ive seen here. I will just say that as a lover of the epics i have seen most if not all of the movies dealing with the Passion. This one is the best by far in depicting the violent times in which this occured. I too have seen many Fulci and Argento movies which are very brutal in their own right. this one affected me much more due to the fact that whether you believe or not this is the type of torture Jesus. and many others endured in those times. 5 Stars for Mr. Gibson's masterpiece and 5 for the DVD quality."
4,"This is the best film I'm ever seen. It is more than a movie. seeing 'The Passion of the Christ' is literally a spiritual experience that will not leave you the same. You will be changed one way or the other after seeing what Jesus suffered. The realism of this portrayal captures the historical context of the days Jesus was on earth. Use of the original language adds to the authenticity. Similarly the ethnicity of the actors adds another layer to foundation of capturing history on film.This is an instant classic indeed. Any objective viewer who sees it cannot deny this fact. It is 'other.' i.e.. it is in a category of its own. Yes it might be listed as a 'religious film.' but it is so much more. The artists. producer. writers. creators who put this work together had the help of a Power beyond their abilities."
4,"Did Mel want do resell this video or was it because he wanted the art to speak for itself. then over time say his part?I didn't even know this was out until someone on the radio was discussing watching it. It seems like there was always a 'making of' planned for the DVD but with the controversy surrounding the film. it seems like he put this on the shelf until time had passed by.There was little to no promotion regarding this special edition as I mentioned. so I don't think this was about reselling as it is giving the fans of this film what they want.Time has passed to be able to watch the film. listen to the commentary and now get a peek behind the curtain.Braveheart is still my favorite of his though."
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
4,"I think everyone should see this movie at least once. Then never again. There is this cool book. the Bible. tells the whole story without all the blood and tears. I saw this movie with a group of my friends and we were all crying by the end. Even the ones who aren't religious. It is a very powerful movie. But not a movie I would want to see over and over again. Not only because there is not a lot of replay value. but also because of the sheer violence."
4,"I'd rank this movie right up the with the best of the slasher films. It is The Texas Chainsaw massacre or Faces of Death 5 of our generation. Just when you thought horrible fanatical death was only the perveiw of the cable news networks Mel Gibson gave us this gem of a gorefest. If you like blood. flaying. misplaced entrails and seeing a man brutally murdered this is the movie for you. Like other movies in it's genre it has no redeeming qualities but unmitigated brutality all there for you to see. What more could you ask from a movie. Now that we have this on DVD we can all sit back and enjoy the ride at home. Grab a 6-pack. a pack of smokes and turn on the surround sound and let every bone crunch and death scream remind you that movie greatness still exists in the new millenium."
4,"As a man. a prophet. the son of God...or any other way you see him. no one in their right mind would argue the greatness of Jesus Christ.  His philosophy. teachings. and sacrifices are beyond comprehension.However. i was not impressed with this movie.  The graphic detail that showed what he went through was moving. yes. but that was the whole movie.  Everyone knows what Jesus went through. so I didn't see it as necessary to drag it out for 2 hours with occasional flashbacks.I think it was like watching Braveheart. but having the movie begin where Wallace was captured. and covering for the most part his trial and torture. and ultimate death.  Then adding intermitent flashbacks of other parts of the movie.  I appologize to anyone this may offend. i recoginize that this is a sensitive subject. but I'm unimpressed.*Final point: this may be some of the best cinematography I've ever seen.  from that aspect I would give the movie six stars."
4,"you will love this movie its so real like and will move you. you will sit and cry all the way to the end. you will see howmuch of pain that christ went though. be careful about small children watching this movie. it has alot of  bad parts in itit show how christ was beat and his body with blood all over him. and when they nail him to the cross. these parts are so bad. not for children to watch. this movie will make you stop and think how much pain he went though for us. it changed my life."
4,"When I was younger. phrases like 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' seemed like ad slogans and I ignored them.Now that I'm older. it strikes me that the tale of Jesus Christ is indeed the greatest story ever told.  Whether it be true or false (historically) it has certainly attracted an enormous number of believers -- and. as an amateur historian with a large library of books about Christianity. I have little doubt that the main outlines of the story of Jesus are true.Which leads me to echo another reviewer: Is this the way we human beings treat God?  You might want to take a look at Dostoevski's tale of 'The Grand Inquisitor' (in his novel 'The Brothers Karamazov') for another perspective on the idea that human beings cannot live with the idea of God -- that we cannot tolerate it.Mel Gibson's terrific movie presents that horrifying idea in a way that will not be forgotten.  A cinematic masterpiece."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
4,"OK. I have to first admit that I'm anti - religious and I've always held the opinion that a religion-based nation is one that hasn't realized that we're living in the 21st century and not the 16th.  But that really didn't affect my reaction to this film. which is a brutal. trashy piece of Christ-propaganda.  Christ was not the only person of that time period who suffered through this much torture and brutality.  It was commonplace for people who had differences with those in authority to be beaten and executed.  Mel fails to explain what singled out Christ as a symbol of good because a)he is a shallow and poor filmmaker and b)he doesn't care. he just wants an excuse to show people lots of sickening violence to spark their guilt.  Don't allow yourself to be roped in by this exploitive nonsense; Jesus Christ himself would have taken offense to it."
4,"I know it was a great film but I did not want to see how brutally  they scourged Jesus I know I would cry and did not want to watch.Those that had to see it went to the show to view it I never felt I needed to see it to prove I believed because I did not need proof I believed it and never ever was in unbelief.Jesus is my Lord and Savior.I bought it used and it was perfect in every way I checked it out and the disc had no nicks in it.came on time. everything excellentI am glad I have it if someone wants to see it I will share it with them. I like to help others that want to know more about Jesus and who He is and what He did for us."
4,"5 Star'sThe film was very epic and showed  the suffering Christ absorbed for the children of God. The Pain of Mary seen through the eyes of her love for her son captured my heart. She as for Christ forgave everyone who tormented the only man that the only crime for spreading the Lord God message was crucified on the cross. The people that wanted Christ put to death condemned him because they were afraid and ignorant of change. Mass hysteria created by ignorance fueled the hotheaded masses to put Christ to death. Fear of the unknown at that era was the Justice the church & people wanted.  Christ knew he had to leave this mortal life on earth to a higher purpose. But his Love for mankind shunted his existence. For God for seen Christ end on earth and took him in his arms to  a higher existence where he could worshiped in the hearts of everyone who believed in him."
4,"Besides the religious backdrop. the main crux of this movie is to depict as much realism and authenticity as possible about the corporeal punishment during the Roman times. From the religious view point. the movie wants you to feel visually what your Lord has gone through.If you think that the 39 lashes were just mere whips. you are quite misinformed. Read Josh McDowell's book on Crucifixion and  you will get the written version about the instruments used during Jesus' time. Again. the crucifixion itself was shown under full light with no turning away of the camera.In my opinion. the movie has achieved. in stellar proportions. what it had set out to do. The additional depiction of Mary's love for her Son was well constructed. although not documented the way the movie has shown. All in all. the theatrical effects are moving and they are a good reminders for believers.Good work. Mel!"
4,"This movie is too much about the screenwriters interpretation of religion and their obsession with violence and not enough about the glorious creative & loving God of our world. There is only one God of our world. the creator. Yet. there are hundreds of man-made church organizations. Looking back through history one will see that the conflicts of man-made ideologies are a major source of war and other types of violence. We do not need this type of violent movie to have faith in our God.A movie composed of violence is exploitative of its viewers. There are no exceptions. Violence breeds evil and should not be depicted in any excess just for storytelling."
4,"There is nothing 'real' or 'realistic' about Gibson's portrayal of violence in this movie. It is. quite simple. an orgiastic celebration of pain and suffering. See the bad guys sneer and laugh as the blood splatters their faces with full Dolby sound effects! In many ways the violence in 'Kill Bill' is more subtle than this. Regardless of its historical accuracy (who cares?). this piece of celluloid is nothing more than one opinionated director's desperate--and unintelligent--flagellation of the audience. For the time capsule called. 'The Dumbing of America.' save room for this ridiculously overblown religious treatise that cheapens. not celebrates. the life of Christ. Pure drivel."
4,"I watched The Passion at my church saturday night.  This was the second time.  The first was when it came out and it was a lot to take in.  This time it was different.  It was far more spiritual the second time - a year later.Being done in the language of the day is HUGE.  Both times I saw the movie I got the feeling that I was actually witnessing the day Christ was crucified.  Now when i see movies about Christ that are in English I have trouble connecting with them and somewhat even taking them seriously.I suggest that anyone. who thinks that Christ did not take on the sins of the world. should see this film with an open heart and mind."
4,"Passion of the Christ is a must have DVD (or video)It is horrifying. graphic. detailed and yet enlightening.I cried through the entire movie. That's how much impact this movie had on me.Though sub-titled. it is easily followed. And since I just finished reading the Bible again. the scenes you can recall from the KJV Bible.Christ endured so much torture and agony for us to take away our sins. And this is not fiction. It is the TRUTH!Even if you don't believe fully in God and Jesus Christ. watch this movie. It just may change your mind on how His life was and what He went through for all of us.I love Mel Gibson as an actor. 'Maverick'. 'Lethal Weapon' series. etc. But as a director. I saw a true artist. This was his vision of how he saw what Christ endured. And he followed the Bible closely. Pure talent. Exceptional movie.A collectors item. definitely!"
4,"If you want to view an interpretation of Christ that reduces him to little more than a helpless idiot. watch this movie.  If you actually respect him. avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing. then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here. he is portrayed as a victim. dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there. just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message. love. pacificm. or teachings. it's a sensationalist view of his suffering. which doesn't fit well with the Christ story."
4,"I hated it from the beginning to the end.  The plot was too predictable with very little surprises.  The lines were weak and uninspiring.  You come to a point where you literally want to see Jesus die so that the suffering would end for the viewer. Talk about flogging a theme. this one wins. palms down!Again I got caught up with the hype and controversy. regarding this film.  I made a promise to myself that this would be the last film that I shall purchase. before I see it first. so help me God!"
4,"While to some the scenes of violence may be seen as excessive the emotional impact balanced it out it was never violence for the sake of violence but to show or attempt to show some of christs enourmous suffering. The scene with Mary picking Jesus up will soften most of the most hardened hearts. I love many of the 50's type bible epics but this one was the first to promote a real emotional connection. the fact thats its no in english will not bother you it actually enhances the film Mel gibson has hit the bash train latley I enjoy the majority of the films he directs the music the emotion and the fire i really appreciate about the guys films."
4,"In a world where most movies have a Hollywood twist and pervert the truth of the scripture. Mel Gibson has does a wonderful job showing the pain that Jesus Christ went through for all of us. James Caviezel does an excellent job playing Christ and showing the human side and physical pain! The location of the film (where it was shot) is absolutely realistic. the characters of the film are realistic and it felt as if I was there. Without the Spirit of God. you won't enjoy the film ... you'll call it a horror film. but this film so much more. Even if you don't believe that Jesus Christ was the Christ. it is still a powerful movie ... and the question that comes to mind is how another human torture another human can like that? It is just unbelievable that we can be that cruel!"
4,"If this movie was about anything else other than the passion of Christ the very people who support it would be screaming to ban it.  This is an incredibly violent film with needless buckets of blood. Seeing the son of God turned into hamburger did not inspire me or increase or decrease my faith.  Truly awful acting from secondary and tertiary actors and blatant homophobia in the Herod portion of the film add to a nasty mix.  Good acting from primary actors and superior cinematography are the few saving graces. The bold decision to make this multi-lingual and subtitled also deserves to be tried again.  Only for fundamentalist Christians and devout Roman Catholics and not be viewed by anyone under 17."
4,"I knew when I first saw previews for this movie and started hearing things about it. that I would not want to go see it. and if. for some reason. I did end up watching it. I would not like it. I was correct.First and foremost. this movie was incredibly boring. A good majority of the movie is spent watching Jesus get beat. hit. cut. or stabbed. I see no reason why anyone would enjoy watching this unless he is a sadist.The movie would get much lower than a five if it weren't for the scenes where it shows flashbacks that Jesus has with him spending time with his apostles. These scenes are uplifting. interesting. and sometimes humorous. The rest of the movie is just a bloody mess that seems to focus more on making you cringe than making you feel sympathetic."
4,"'The Passion of the Christ' is an extremely graphic motion picture that depicts the gruesome torture & death of Jesus Christ. I'm not going to give a summary about this film because everyone should already know what it's about. This movie was very dramatic. very emotional. and extremely unsettling. The film contains the most graphic scourging scene in movie history!!! I wouldn't let your children watch this. Wait until they get a bit older. The acting is superb. the story. script. and characters are incredible. The soundtrack is depressingly atmospheric. Whether you're a believer or not. this movie is well worth a look. You'll walk away a changed person."
4,"I saw the Passion of the Christ several months ago when it was first released in theaters. however it's message of unconditional love and selfless sacrifice remain indelibly etched in my mind. As any who have caught wind of the film well know. it is visually. the most graphic depiction of Christ's final hours ever conceived. Unlike many others though. I feel as though the its graphic nature only acts as a catalyst to enhance the viwer's grasp of the magnitude of the sacrifice Christ made to absolve us of our sins. Granted. it may be too violnet for others. especially those who are used to the archetypical. bloodless version of Christ's crucifixion. which we've become so accustomed to from movies past. My best advice to those who are debating on whether or not they're willing to see it. is that Christian or not. everyone can benefit positively from what this film has to say."
4,"The movie was based on the Bible which is historically correct.  This is the most powerful movie to date. A visually stunning cinematic experience.  While watching you should have a box of tissues handy because to know that Jesus suffered for us in that way you will not be able to help yourself from crying if not weeping.  I would recommend that everyone watch the movie even if you don't believe in Jesus.  The directing was done on an expert level by Mel Gibson and I commend him for putting this film out to the public."
4,"I'm a Christian and from day one I thought I have to go and see this. I went last night with a couple of friends and I'm telling the film was overwhelming. The film was so different yet excellent and you could feel what Jesus was going through. not just physically but emotionally and psychologically too. The film is basically about the last 12 hours leading to Jesus' death but there are a lot of messages portrayed in this film. It's one of those films where you watch and analyse for yourself. This film really makes you think and is so challenging not just for the Christian but for everybody. When the film was over none of us could speak. I was just in floods of tears. This is a warning to all mankind that Jesus is coming back soon....we don't when but he is so we all need to fix up and realize that life is not just on Earth here. This film is deep and should be seen by all....well done Mel Gibson may God Bless You....."
4,"I was amazed and brought to tears many times by this movie. it really showed the depths and breaths of Jesus' love for me and for the world. He's worth serving with all my heart. that is for sure.Mel Gibson did a fantastic job with this movie. Hopefully many lives will be changed. Go see it today!!Ignore the critics. it's not anti-semetic. it's not as violent as I thought it would be. For thoses who say it's a 'snuff film' you are barking mad! It's all make-up people. it's not real!! But His love and  word are."
4,"This was and is a riveting movie.  When I saw I at the theatre. it kept the audience quiet through most of the movie.  The brutality was not held back and matched the biblical description.  Reading and seeing are two different things and is the reason it's rating was meant to keep children from watching.  The one debatable scene was one regarding St. Veronica's encounter with reason which is a catholic belief and not necessarily biblical (Gibson is or was catholic).  If you want to relive Christ's crucifixion. this is it."
4,"I can sum it up in one sentence: The Worst Movie that I ever saw. I know that Christs last hours were horrifying. but this movie. the way it is cut. goes way beyond what the Bible says. It is like he wanted to make the goriest movie of all times. not a factual account of Christs last hours. It was so bad that I couldnt watch the whole movie. I wish the Mel Gibson had made a 'REAL' movie of his last hours. Save your money. and read the bible for the truth."
4,"The passion of the christ is a very moving. realisistic view of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus of nazareth. Never before has a movie rendered so much power and intensity and selflessness as this one does. If you haven't seen it yet- you will be amazed! And it isn't the jews that crucified Jesus. it is everyday people like you and me that sin against God. We are the reason he had to be nailed to a cross. And if any of you object to the violence and gore shown. walk a mile in Jesus' shoes- then you'll know what it's like."
4,"This wasnt about the Jews. or the gentiles. It was about the Son of Man coming to earth to redeem us. all of us. We had all sinned. we had all fallen short. Certain Jews & romans just happened to be the catalyst that fulfilled the prophecy...They could have been any denomination. but they happened to be in power then (all be it. thru the courtasy of the romans) and that was what was used.I do not in anyway hold the Jews responsible for the crusifixion of Christ. nor do I hope. do other Christians. People were used throughout history to forfill a destiny.Even Judas fate was sad to me as it seemed to fullfill the phrophesy and yet was regreted almost immediately upon reflection.Part of the confrontation however. I believe. was to bring the gentiles band in to the fold. Through Peter and Paul. The think we must remember is God workd on a bigger plan than you and I.Sorry if this is preachy. its just what I felt."
4,"Christ's compassion is there in a certain sense. but the love. and not the violence should be glorified here.Which term would Christ approve of more?  The glory of love or the glory of violence. I think it would be the former.Gibson should have concentrated on what Christ did to teach love in many different examples. not to let the violence go on and on and on and on and on.Three stars for effort...that's it.I still think Mel is a brilliant actor."
4,"I have this version and to tell you the truth have only watched once or twice since this version came out cause it is just way too violent even for a re-cut version. I understand it has to be realistic but Jesus whipping goes on what feels like for days. For a believer. it really does make you feel the extent of what Jesus went through in front of the Jews. If you don't mind the gore. then you will enjoy it. However. I kind of think I didn't need to purchase this movie a long time ago. Great to watch around Easter."
4,"This movie was great. my wife and I decided to go see it last Saturday night. Jesus was played by the young and attractive heart throb. James Caviezel. Jesus was taunted ruthlessly. Jesus was beaten mercilessly. Jesus was whipped until every inch of his body bled. Jesus was kicked. spit on. and humiliated. Finally he was crucified.Needless to say my wife and went home and I had the best sex of our life after later that night after the flick.The only thing I was disappointed with was that it wasn't Monica Bellucci who did the whipping."
4,"Do not understand the charges of anti-semitism leveled against this film. In my lifetime I've seen this story filmed countless times. From the 1961 KING OF KINGS to George Steven's gargantuan THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD to THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW to JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR to Zefferelli's JESUS OF NAZARETH and Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST all telling the same story with the same cast of characters. While some of them created controversy over political or creative thinking. others generated criticism over casting choices. none of them had charges of anti-semitism hurled at them. All the good guys are Jews. all the bad guys are either Roman. Jewish high priests or non-believers. What made Mel Gibson's film so different? And why did so many people jump on the bandwagon? Except for the violence. Gibson doesn't do anything the other films didn't already do. So what lies behind all this?"
4,"This movie is supposed to be a real life depiction of Christ in his final hours. Mel Gibson seems determined to show the viewer just how much suffering Jesus went through.Mr. Gibson has stated that 'The Forces Of EVIL' were at work during the making of this movie and conspiring to stop him from making this piece of Christian Propaganda.Perhaps somebody should spend 30 million dollars of their OWN MONEY(!!!) and make a movie about The Inquistion or all of the so called Holy Wars where people were tortured and killed in the Name Of Jesus. Just a thought. No doubt movie producers will now cross the road when they see Mel coming and I would not at all be surprised if this movie spells the end for Mr. Gibson's acting career not that I think he cares about that.If you really want to see the results of over zealous Christian Devotion  then this movie is for you.I give ths movie 5 stars because I kind of like the scenery in it which looks pretty authentic."
4,"I have never been to a movie where no one got up to get refreshments and no one talked during the movie.  At the end everyone including me just sat there for a few minutes before getting up to leave.  This film was so real and so moving that I cried steadily from the very first time Jesus was struck in the Garden of Gethsemane until he died on the cross.  To think he went through such torture for us.  I especially felt for Mary who had to watch her son suffer and die and I can understand why she wanted to die with him.  Everyone should watch this movie."
4,"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this movie. as it is one of those movies that are well made. but simply unenjoyable. I say this because watching the torture of a righteous man. the son of God. is simply hard to see.As a movie. there isn't much to this. However. this is a historically accurate movie that portrays the death of Christ very accurately. as well as the suffering he went through. Much of it is horrific and hard to watch. thus the 'R' rating.I strongly discourage younger viewers from seeing this movie. If you're looking for enjoyment. don't watch this either. I do recommend everyone watching this at least once though. simply to understand it's content and what Christians believe."
4,"Shiva Damienson has got it all wrong.  Every other movie about the New Testamont has been inacurate in their dipiction of Christ's crusifixtion.  If you've seen movies like Jesus of Nazereth and others from that era. than your eyes will be opened when you see this film.  If you consider the film to be overly violent than stay away from it. even if you are a Christian like me.  I am a Christian and was disturbed by the violence. but that was because it was commited against my savior: an inoccent man.  The movie is rated R for a reason. so this movie is not appropriate for a younger audience. but for anyone who has the stomach to handle it. than see it."
4,"This is not a DVD. this is a world-wide experience. Everytime I watch this DVD. I realize exactly what Jesus did to save me and.as painful and hard as it is to watch. I love HIM even more. It's not for the faint of heart. it's not the traditional family movie. It is however a very essential DVD to receive as your own personal copy because it teaches you things through words and actions no other movie can teach you. I hope all who gets it appreciated all the effort taken to keeping it authentic in language. events and the message being told. Contrary to what happened to the director. this is his finest work. A masterpiece and a classic."
4,"Nice artistic rendering of the last days of Christ. Not really violent. but it had a taste of old horror films like RoseMary's Baby and The Omen. in the scene of the Devil? with a devil's baby? and also scenes of children turning into devil's faces. that to me was the scariest part. Violence? not really nothing horrendous like most movies out today. no real violence in this. Movie done artistically. and apparently Gibson has a real belief. because of the ruining of the Jewish Temple at the end of the movie makes sure of that. Other than that. you are not sure whether Jesus is a criminal or truly the son of God. All in all not a bad movie. If I sit through it enthralled. then ok. its a 4 or 5 rating. In this case a 4 rating. because there may be some racist attitudes towards Jews slightly in this movie. but all in all good well done watchable movie."
4,"Of course it is! it's the story of the son of God. so obviously it's not for little kiddies.people into heavy metal and rap or Executive producers. The story was good. although. I did feel Gibson did exploit the religious congregation a bit. just to make a lot of money (unexpectedly?); which just means. he's a normal Catholic man - just kidding dude. I liked the film. It was brutally honest - and if you're going by the bible. historically accurate. I much point out. that the whole story is in Hebrew. so if you're going to watch it. get the bifocals out to see the subtitles!"
4,"I held off watching this movie because I had heard so much about the blood and gore. But I knew that I would eventually see it. I embrace the story of Christ and the power of his teachings. Though this film contains only a few scenes of his life and ministry. the depiction of torture and the crucifixion aptly conveys a message of love - that is. what Christ was willing to suffer for all mankind. The imagery of the devil was well-placed. And. to me at least. the story moved at a good pace - not too fast. not too slow. Moreover. James Caviezel's performance was outstanding. However. I was not moved emotionally (or. spiritually) the way I had anticipated. Perhaps it was the hype. But I'm glad that it got so much (well-deserved) attention."
4,"I don't really want to talk about the religious aspect that everyone is arguing about... I just think that this is a great movie. It is done very well and looks stunning. The acting was great. It is a violent movie and I don't think anyone knows for sure if Jesus' death was that violent... in fact I don't think anyone knows for sure if God even exists (that's why they call it faith right?) People who say they are 100% certain that God exists are always whack jobs. People who say they are 100% sure that God doesn't exist are just as whacky. But one thing is certain. this is a very entertaining film that is done well and really should be considered one of the best movies of all time."
4,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend in the theaters as soon as it came out.  This is not really a very religious movie. but rather describes the last 12 hours of Jesus before he was crucified.  The content of the movie is very strong though.  Throughout the whole movie. I was bothered by how many times Christ was punished...was just in about every other scene!  I think. that the director(s) abused a little of the punishment. but that's my opinion.  We didn't get to live those times to find out how it really was. but it was very hard. lots of punishment and suffering.It shows clearly all the suffering Jesus went through. and how he stayed strong the whole way.  Like another reviewer mentioned. the Satan character and deamons that haunt Judas were well done.Overall. the movie is very good. with lots of strong & violent scenes and sad moments as well. Go watch it and/or buy it and renew your faith!"
4,"This movie is more like a propaganda film. None of us will ever know for sure about the historical Jesus. since he lives more in myths and beliefs than in historical chronicle. How did Mr Gibson know about the level of cruelty shown? Moreover. Jesus was depicted more like the conventional iconography--caucasian male with a beard and long hair. How did a hard working carpenter look in 2000 yrs old Middle East? Certainly not like the one shown.However. this movie did one good thing for me: reminded me about the necessity to cultivate compassion for fellow human beings. On the other hand. for the simple-minded. literal believer. this movie will generate hate. vengeance. and totally undeserving surge of emotion.From that standpoint. I must say. this movie fell short as a visual art.Watch it. but please 'watch out' about what you feel."
4,"The movie is very vivid and emotional. I don't like to watch violence. but I think in this case it shows exactly what our Savior went through so that we can have salvation. It adds meaning to it. It's very difficult to watch because of how awful they were to Him. but it depicts the love of God for us. thus strengthening our love for Him. He made that ultimate sacrifice for us. so now it's our turn to make our sacrifices for Him. even unto death."
4,"I have to admit. I cried in the movie theater. at least twice. The guy next to my boyfriend wept like a repenting sinner. people cleared their noses and throats. They clasped their mouths.The brutal portrayal of Jesus's last 12 hours were gory. unhuman. bloody. tragic. and filled me with sorrow and love for him.It was an amazing movie. and the cast was perfect for it. A must see for anyone appreciating the deep topics.I think in a funny way. this hollywood production made me feel closer to God. it did not make me think any less of Jewish people. and it made me cry deeply when I got home. to let those emotions that I bottled up during the showtime. free.Go see it. I think everyone should."
4,"I can understand Gibson wanting to do something different but I wasn't crazy about the final product. The sets. the actors. and the music were all beautiful & amazing & artistic. I even loved that it was done in the ancient languages. What I didn't like was that Jesus' message was not even included in this film. It seemed to be all about the crucifixion which made it a rather joyless. excruciating viewing experience. I wish the film had been mainly about the message of Christ. because I feel the artistry and beauty of the film will be wasted because so many people will only want to watch this film once."
4,"We all know the story of Jesus Christ. He lived as a human and committed no sin. He was the perfect man. Because of this he was able to settle the debt we have built with our sins buy acting as a human sacrifice. This movie gives us a look at how his final hours may have transpired. It's very powerful and very upsetting.This is an incredible movie. It is passionate. as the title suggests. and very realistic. The acting is perfect and the message is timeless. Whether you believe that Jesus was the son of God or not. you can appreciate the passion and love he had for his fellow man. It's amazing to think that he endured what he did as a human. when he also possessed the power of God. If you can handle the brutality and emotional toll this film will take on you. I strongly recommend it. Be ye warned! It's extremely graphic and hard not to look away from at times."
4,"People who don't like it because of the gore. Let me tell you something. The gore scenes in this film are extremley grade school compared to the way it really happened. There has never been or ever will be a civilization as decadent and barbaric as the roman empire. They were masters of torture and what the Jesus Christ suffered in this film was nothing even close to what the real Jesus Christ endured for us so we wouldn't have to go to Hell. The Non Christian who watches this film can not truly appreciate the love Jesus had for us going to the cross like the Christian can. Watch it not the gore scenes. You want to see gore watch Dawn Of The Dead or The Burning Moon. You want a true love story watch this film."
4,"This film leaves so much to be desired by the time the closing credits roll. you wonder why you sat through it in the first place. It appears to have absolutely no purpose... just meanders along violently... never giving... and there are few stories whether true or fictional that are better more exciting fare for good film-making than this -- so the plot was thick and ripe for an amazing movie experience... but they just didnt pull it off unfortunately. If you love the Jesus story you will be sadly dissappointed by this strange twisted desultory mess of a film."
4,"Outstanding. Not only did Mel Gibson show the suffering that Jesus endured on his final hours of life. but the compassion and loving kindness he has for all mankind.When I went to see this film. which was on the very first release day. when the film ended not one person left the cinema. We all sat there and watched as the credits and music played. I am not sure why we did this. Maybe we saw what life is truly about. and we didn't want it to end there. Or maybe we were shocked that this happened. and we have taken it for granted for all these years.What I do know is that this film is outstanding. It is the best film I have ever seen. because it impacted me in such a positive and good way. Highly recommended."
4,"i may be a metalhead. but i know that Jesus died for my sins and He comes first in my life before any metal band does. this movie is awesome. but there are a few things that don't happen in the Holy Bible. like satan carrying around a baby. Judas Iscariot being tormented by a bunch of kids.and one of the criminals getting pecked in the head by a crow. if this movie moved you to accept Jesus as your Savior. remember these three things: Jesus died. Jesus rose. and Jesus is coming again."
4,"Mel Gibson's film of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus focuses on his torture and crucifixion.  There is little dialogue. and it mostly consists of passages from the Bible.  The spoken Aramaic and English subtitles were not distracting. as the story is so familiar.  The brutality is unrelenting. but it was realistic.This movie is not for everyone.  It is not 'entertaining.'  Those who liked the old movies 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' and 'King of Kings'  will not be surprised by anything here (only the degree to which the torture is shown). because it is the same story.  It is an intimate. in-your-face. almost real-time reenactment of the crucifixion.  Due to the very personal and intense reaction people have to the movie. I think it would have been better shown in churches than in the theatre."
4,"Very important to see so to understand more deeply the oblation of Our Lord on good friday and it's beginning at the last supper. This film is a terrific meditation primer for the sorrowful mysteries of the rosary. the stations of the cross. and the sorrows of our lady. It is something amazing which has been given to the church and to all souls as a gift. to know Jesus better and that He loves us most piercingly.When this film came to the prisons there were many conversions. This shows us that God's work can be in the media and that we should pray for more of that work to be done."

4,"If you enjoyed Stanley Kubrick's ClockWork Orange. you'll like this film. It was nothing more than a long winded film of the good old 'Ultra Violence'. Yes. it was anti-Semitic. or biblically accurate whatever suits your religion. whether you're a Jew or a Christian or if you're into that sort of thing. I viewed the movie for its face value which was nothing more than a mere long video of Jesus getting his A** kicked. which was not only unrealistic because the frail actor that they chose for the movie would have collapsed within the first thirty minutes of the brutal beating he was receiving. The most interesting character in the film was Satan who was portrayed by Rosalinda Celentano who just kept lurking around in the background with those eerie androgynous looks. However with all the hype about this movie. it is a must see. and that's why I waited until it was in the video stores because I already knew what to expect."
4,"I just saw this movie with one of my younger sisters for Easter. and we were both very moved by it. It is definitely a realistic portrayl of what Jesus had to go through for us. Watching this movie. in a way. has brought me closer to Jesus. and it really left an impact on me. It's a very heavy movie. however. and very difficult to watch. I don't like to see people getting hurt. so seeing Jesus get hurt was especially hard for me. But it really shows you how much Jesus loves and cares for us all by taking the burden of sin for us. I think this is a movie everyone should see because it is a real reminder of the wonderful love Jesus has for all of us. The movie was all in Hebrew. too. with subtitles. so it was very realistic and quite faithful to the Gospels. Mel Geibson did a wonderful job sharing with us a very realistic glimpse of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus."
4,"Dr. Satan. you seem to think you know Mel's motivations. I think you're speaking through your jaded perceptions. When Mel started work on this film. he ponied up his own money. He didn't even have a distributor for the film. but he went on with the production. He filmed a movie in two dead languages. He has spent another $10 million of his own money to build a church building in his hometown. His actions show him to be a devout man.If he were only concerned with profit he could have churned out another Lethal Weapon movie. His films and him personally have already made a mint.I saw The Last Temptation of Christ. aside from the final sequence when He comes off of the cross. the movie not very risky."
4,"In the film Gibson adds the scene where Christ tells his Apostles 'There is no greater love than to give one's life'. Now that I'm an adult. if I could watch how much my own parents have endured with unselfish sacrifice. sleep deprivation. worry. and suffering to raise me in the best unselfish way they could to make me a better person. I guarantee you. I would be thankful. In fact any child would want to run to their loving parents with a tearful embrace asking their forgiveness in taking them for granted. To watch what another endured for me inspires me to be unselfish in raising my own children and in going out of the way for others without complaint. This is the essence of Christianity and this is the message The Passion delivers."
4,"Although I will never watch it again. I was glad that I went to see this powerful movie.  It accurately portrays Jesus' last tortured hours on planet earth.  I give kudos to Gibson. who was brave enough to finance this movie himself. amidst much controversy.  I would encourage all to watch this movie. at least one time. to understand why throughout the ages. thousands have been willing to die for their belief in a man called Jesus Christ.Yes. this movie is violent. but this world is violent. and Jesus did not come to escape the realities of this world. but to share in our sufferings."
4,"I am not a 'religious' person. however. I felt it was important to see this movie.  If nothing else. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.After sitting through a very quiet showing. my wife and I got up and walked out without saying a word.  It took a while for the movie to sink in.  Nobody was talking as they left the theatre.It was a moving experience.  Graphic and disturbing.  Something I am glad that I sat through. but can't see adding this to my movie collection.More interesting than the movie itself. is the reaction of those who liked or disliked it.  Reading the reviews of this movie is a great way to see the cultural divide in our country."
4,"Of all the movies i've seen about the crucifixion and resurrection of the Christ. this movie has the most accurate portrayal as I've seen so far even though in the bible Jesus had suffered a far more gruesome beatings than what was shown in film but it's as close as it gets. The movie also has the characters speaking in hebrew instead of english unlike other films about the crucifixion. However I suggest that people watch this film with caution. it shows alot of graphic stuff including blood and it's definately not for younger children.  It's a great film overall."
4,"Master.Things are going very smoothly. Undoubtedly.Emmerich's pervasive presence has allowed meto persevere on the set; it's the same spiritualforce I believe that will catapult this film to thetop of the box office. In my ponderings. I can'thelp but wonder if these same forces are what aidedher in her levitating and astral projecting. Itake devilsh delight in believing so.If you would kindly send me another copy of 'TheDolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ' I wouldbe indebted to you. Unfortunately. my copy wascovered in blood. It seems to be everywhere. I justcan't help myself sometimes. And I can't help butfeel wholly nostalgic as I'm transported back tothe blood-drenched fields of Scotland and SC.The Director"
4,"'The Passion Of The Christ' is a towering example of what motion pictures can be. It takes the 2000-year-old gospel narratives and brings them to life in a way that is shocking in its realism and power.Mel Gibson has been true to his intention: to make a movie that will stand the test of time. one that can reinvigorate the faith of some and perhaps cause others to find theirs.The acting. cinemetography. and score are all Oscar-caliber. The special effects bring the Passion of Jesus to life. so real they enduce cringes and outpourings of sympathy. Jim Caviezel should have been nominated for the Academy Award for his protrayal of the Son of God.This is a movie that everyone should see. and any practicing Christian will want to own. Five stars!"
4,"This movie sets a new standard for subsequent Jesus films. I must confess that I was disposed to 'like' the film no matter what. but having seen it. I find it truly remarkable. It was not entertaining... It is a film for reflection. Gibson captures perfectly the sentiment that the 'Christ should suffer and die' (the Gospel according to Luke). And for who? All of us. One cannot expect to appreciate this movie if all one wants is a good flick. This film challenges Christians and non-Christians alike to reflect on the sufferings of Christ.As an aside. I would not take small children to this film (in fact. the crucifixion scenes in most films are too much for small children). And I would recommend that viewers read one of the gospels. if not all of the gospels. before viewing it. As it covers the last 12 hours of Christ's life. much can be gained from a close reading of the biblical texts."
4,"I have many blu-ray's and was excited when i saw that The Passion was finally coming to blu-ray! I was not disappointed. although it looks mildly different. you can see every nook and cranny. It looks amazing. It is a little grainy at times. but it doesn't steal the show like other blu-ray titles i have! I would definitely recommend this title to any one wanting to see a great movie on their big screen tv's. Definately don't pass this up!"
4,"So many reviews are expressions of one's beliefs that they fail to pay tribute to James Caviezel. a young man whose faith and strength of character is reflected in the depth of this role.  Every actor searches for a role that will define his skills and be a part of his being.  The role of Jesus will be such a role for James Caviezel. This is a movie that causes us to look at the history of the time and how politics. greed. and fear combine to create suffering for an innocent Jesus.  Whether one is a believer or not. one has to look at the screen as a canvas where Mel Gibson as an artist uses Caviezel as his instrument to create a masterpiece.  It causes one to be humble in the presence of such power and glory.  Thank You Mel and Thank You James for sharing your commitment and passion with the world. You said to the world 'the battle of good versus evil is still the same'---here it is ---this hasn't changed in over two thousand years."
4,"'...'The Passion of the Christ' has caused plenty of controversy. just like the ministry of Christ did and still continues to do to this day. When a faith-oriented film has such an emotional impact on so many lives and creates so much discussion between millions of people with different religious backgrounds. you know a must-see feature has been made.' -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder'It's the same story the Bible's been telling us for years. but Mel Gibson did a truly awesome job of bringing it to people in such a real way.' -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films. check out cruciflicks.net where 'We don't judge people. just the movies they make.'"
4,"No word can accurately describe this epoc produced by Mel Gibson.  This is the first time any movie production has made an effort to depict the true gruesomeness and agony that Christ suffered on that last day.  Yes. this makes for an incredibly gory film. yet at the same time. the gore isn't for the sake of gross. it is to try to be true to the very real event in history.For the believer - it should be impossible to sit through it without being totally and completely overwhelmed by Christ's suffering.  If you have a dry eye after watching this - you need to re-evaluate your relationship with Christ.For the unbeliever - THIS is how much God loves you - that he gave his only Son to pay such a horrible price that you could not possibly pay yourself - for your sin.Watch this movie.  It will change how you look at Jesus Christ."
4,"I don't speak ancient aramaic. and I'm probably being uncool to admit that I hate to read subtitles.  But my problem with this film is the violence.  I think it's way too much. and really bruises the viewers unneccessarily.  I understand that part of the Christian experience is to understand the sacrifice and pain. but I felt like I was watching a Tobe Hooper Chainsaw massacre at times.  For the violence. I give the film 1-star and WARN PARENTS before scarring their children.  For Gibson's good intentions. I give the film 5-stars.  It averages to 3 stars."
4,"Excellent film has many gripping and brilliantly realized scenes throughout.  I am sure many people are going to be divided about this film although I do not believe that it is anti-semitic in the slightest.  It will be very violent to some.  I thought that Gibson directed the film amazingly.  The acting by Jim Caviezel is astonishing.  Well shot cinematography and musical score.  But I can't say that it is the best religious film I have ever seen.  That title still belongs to 'Ben Hur'."
4,"Beautifully acted and filmed (by the son of noted Holocaust denier Hutton Gibson). obviously made with 'passion' for the (literal and figurative) self-flagellation crowd. After the poor guy gets the lash for the 114th time (yeah. I know it's only 39; it just seemed like 114). with all that red-dyed corn syrup splattering all over the place. it just starts to get a little silly. kind of like the flying entrails in ANDY WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN. Capital punishment is. of course. not very funny. especially when the punishment is Death By Torture. so I did my best not to laugh.If Evangelicals. Opus Dei Catholics. sadists and other moonbats want to go all swooney over this sort of thing. they are most welcome to. To the curious. but more sqeamish. of my fellow nonbelievers. I would not suggest watching this after a heavy meal. If you must do so. keep a bucket handy."
4,"As everyone knows. Mel Gibson's film focuses on the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus.  From the Garden of Gethsemenie to turture to crucifixion to resurrection. Mel Gibson's movie is a emotional journey through the heart of Christian belief.  Is it bloody?  Yes.  Is it violent?  Yes.  Does that diminish its value?  Not in the least.  This movie is an unflinching view of Jesus' final hours that is powerful and moving.  mes Caviezel. Maia Morgenstern. and Monica Bellucci give stunning performances as Jesus. Mary. and Mary Magdeline respectively.  The emotions that they convey on their faces is heartbeaking.  As for the anti-Semitism. I did not see any.  I think that you will see what you want to see in this regard. although I do not believe contains any anti-Semitic views.  I recommend that everyone (Christian or not) take in a viewing of this amazing film."
4,"This movie takes the rather sanitized version of Jesus' crucificion and brings home the fact that the reality was far more brutal than any of us could imagine. Understanding what Jesus endured so that the rest of us could be saved is by far the most important aspect of christianity. People who just don't 'get' this movie are people who have no belief in the christian faith - I am not criticizing them. I am just suggesting that they may not truly understand the impact of this movie.There has been alot of criticism levelled that this movie is anti-semetic. It is not. It is telling the story as it was. If someone walks away from this movie with anger. then they have obviously not understood the message."
4,"any film that deals with Jesus is bound to stir up some kind of controversy and this film had alot of people split. the depictions and the Blood and intensity kept you on the edge.  the film was captivating in the directing and overall story telling and the various perspectives that capture your mind set upon digesting all that is taken place.  I found the pacing of this film to be very incredible and it just moved me. the Cross scene and the nailing parts were deep and very Profound. the film is two hours and i felt it flew by. it asnwered alot of questions and also made you see things in a completely different light. very Powerful and a very Good film."
4,"I sat in a sold out theater in complete silence along with everyone else. I don't see how anyone can enjoy this film of suffering. but you can learn from it and appreciate this sacrifice shown in brutal detail. Jim Caviezel beautifully played Christ. and I really felt his suffering jump off the screen as if my own soul was being tortured. The film was much more violently graphic and gory than even I suspected. and I have seen almost every splatter horror film ever made (Dead Alive anyone?). But the real diffrence is that 'The Passion of the Christ' has an emotional impact that goes hand in hand with the violence portrayed. This really happened and the violence was extreme. probably more so than the movie even shows. Thanks Mel Gibson for making a film that shows the ultimate Passion of the Christ as close as possibe to the true suffering."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
4,"The movie is punctuated by unfortunate series of continuous beating. Any human being with massive strength would not have been able to sustain such number of flagellations using whips with pointed hooks and nails.The holy Bible does NOT refer to the degree of such ill-treatments. for example the 'scene' when the Cross was 'trundled' on the hill and fell on the dusty ground. with Christ face down.Even the 'abduction' of Christ was transformed into a frenzied activity with exaggerations when they hit Him repeatedly so as to inflict pain until He fell over the road side. chained.We know the Camera can do marvels. but behind it there ought to be reasonable interpretation of events that should take precedence over smart technology."
4,"Wow. I saw this when it came out and wasn't really affected.  I thought of it as a horror movie with a lot of suffering.  Now that I saw it again and have accepted Jesus as my savior I feel differently about this movie.  Its beautifully done and captures what Jesus could of gone through to be our savior.It illustrates very clearly Biblical scripture into the movie.  You have to be moved to see this if not the first time. then the second.  Jesus suffered for our sins.  Through him we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews murdered him and thats why they don't want to accept Jesus as the savior.The Jews were the chosen. BEFORE Jesus came into their life.  Now. if they accept Christ. they will also be redeemed.This movie is powerful and please see it with an open mind.  You will be moved."
4,"Though I may rate it as a 5 star movie. but the truth is that it is unrateable. There are scences which were full of violence and sadistic environment. and there are scences of great pain and emotions flowing. but this does make a difference in making the movie captivating. Personally. I have seen what Chrsit has achieved being a Man and after the resurrection as God. This movie will make you cry even if you are a Believer or not.The very touching scenes of the movie was pain of Mary. Mother of Christ.As far as the flogging scene is concerned. it wasn'st very gross. Even though I have seen many violent movies I couldnt tolerate the flogging of Christ because of the sadistic way the Roman soldiers were torturing Him.The fiction of having Satan (sometimes a man or a woman) around was quite good.I would recommend this movie to everyone. if you are Christian or not. This movie will grow on you very quickly."
4,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me. it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal. poignant. moving. and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion. my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
4,"Honestly to say the least i thought this movie was going to be an ok movie. something to watch when it comes out on dvd or cable. but my cousins had invited me to the movies. who were going to pay for me so i went. this movie was so emotional. anyone who doesnt feel any emotion to this movie. is absolutely heartless. i recommend seeing. but not constantly. maybe once in a long while. its not a movie to keep watching over and over but a good movie to own. I without a doubt give this movie 5 stars. Great job Mr. Gibson on a directorial accomplishment."
4,"I can't understand how people can see this as a recruiting film for churches. Frankly. I worry about people who liked this having custody of children or pets. If anything. it made me want to avoid churchgoers as I avoid Nazis and Klansmen. If I were a Martian arriving on earth and this was shown to me to explain this major religion. I would recommend having the earth vaporized before this dangerous insanity spread. Jesus said some admirable things about mercy and forgiveness. but you won't find them in this sick piece of trash."
4,"I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD.  I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now.  Watch the movie if you have not seen it.  Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins .... when He was innocent of all sins.  Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind. All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul. He made that possible for us by taking on our sins.  Watch the movie.  Please !"
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
4,"I don't see Christ but brutal violence. This seems a documentary film to me. Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways. finally died. Yes. you will see how Jesus suffered and died. vividly to your eyes. Period. The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however. quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle. Do not expect any delete scenes. extra features. casting. or director's commentary. Nothing. Period.Be honest. say if the man in the film is not Jesus. would you rate it the same? If not. because he's not Jesus? Hmm......*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for The Passion of the Christ ***1. Film Rewatchability: LOW2. DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT4. Sound Quality: EXCELLENT(Reviewed by Otto Yuen. 1-Oct-2004)"
4,"That is right. God bless Mel for making one of the most loved and profound depiction of Jesus' crucifixion.Let's face it. there were people in this country who've had it in for Mel sice production on this film began years back. When the worst they predicted failed to materialize they looked like the alarmist fools they are. Mel's tirades just gave them any excuse they needed to attack him all over again.Where is the condemnation for Gary Busey and Billy Zane for starring in an outright antisemitic movie depicting Jewish doctors as ghouls lusting for the body organs of Arabs?Where was the outrage for Marlon Brando when he called Jews 'kikes' right on the Larry King Show?Or what about Russell Crowe who not only once referred to the Maoris of New Zealand as 'niggers' but hit somebody with a telephone?Mel did a really stupid. horrible thing with what he said.But you know what? Suck it up. Accept the asology and let the man get on with his life and the great flicks he makes."
4,"This is the most accurate and inspiring of the Passion Plays ever done on film.Those who find it alarmingly brutal miss the fact that the Crucifixion of Christ was beyond brutal.Without the suffering of Jesus. the Christian religion is pointless.I cannot watch this film very frequently. but I well remember the first time it was screened in Houston on Ash Wednesday.The Catholics. with ashes on their foreheads. quietly watched. The Evangelicals came to their seats with big boxes of popcorn. which they dropped on the floor as they witnessed the horror of the performance. Christianity is not a saccharinesque religion.. Many people learned this for the first time as they watched The Passion of the Christ."
4,"Who is the real Mel Gibson? A devout Catholic full of love. or an entertainer addicted to gore. blood. torture and violence. not only in this movie. but throughout his whole career?Well. it's up to you to decide. Unfortunately. he chose to display violence once more. this time centering his blood-lust around the Christ. to a point that. around the middle of the movie. some viewers were already num to the violence being shown on the screen. in such a way that whatever message this director was trying to pass was lost.It's a shame that such a budget by such a famous actor / director was wasted in telling one of the most important and beautiful stories of the world in this fashion..."
4,"haha  a horror movie?  hmm perhaps.the funny thing is. according to your bible. that's HOW IT HAPPEND.the fact is. no one should be getting offended by this movie.  wah wah it's too violent.  fine. then don't watch.  just because it's about jesus doesn't mean you hafta pay for a ticket.  the advertising for this movie is insane. so don't tell me you didn't KNOW it was going to be violent.  and if you wanted a non-violent movie. maybe you should go watch a comedy.  not a movie about jesus being HUNG ON A CROSS. STABBED. AND BEATEN.  guess what?  according to that book you believe. THAT'S WHAT HAPPEND TO HIM.  did you want Mel Gibson to put up a fake portrayal of what happend????oh. yeah.  and the movie was really good.  i don't even believe this stuff. but it was very emotional. and worth seeing."
4,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly. I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal. some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church. some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes. it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives."
4,"I am not a 'true believer' and went to see the film out of curiosity.  Technically speaking it was a well-filmed and acted movie.  The fact that the dialog was in Aramaic and Latin gave the film historical atmosphere.  Having been exposed to the story of Jesus Christ as a child I did not find the story hard to follow.  However. I'd imagine someone not fully knowledgeable of the death of Jesus could take the Passion out of context.I would not rate the movie as entertaining or informative. The scenes of Jesus' torture and crucifixion I did not think were as macabre as many critics claimed it to be.  (Apparently. the critics have not watched any slasher films in the past 20 years!)It was without a doubt a testament to Mel Gibson's faith and I am sure the faithful were as equally moved. Still it was a good movie and I would recommend the faithful or the open-minded film goer to see it."
4,"This is a religion that never helped its adherents to be moral. No wonder they have done these.- Inquisition in Spain and Goa- Crusades- Ethnic cleansing of American Indians- SIavery- Lynchings- The Anti Chinese league of the Americas- Jim Crowe- The HoIocaust. Read the antisemitic rantings of Martin Luther the founder of the Protestant movement that was the impetus for the Holocaust.- Separate churches for blacks and whites in the bible belt.- BIood Iibel. Read in Wikipedia about this.. OMG! What eviI!In today's world the vast majority of so the called christians are fortunately social christians (church for weddings and funerals only). These social christians use their own moral compass and reject all the vile doctrine of this godforsaken religion called christianity."
4,"I cannot comment on the other languages. but the Latin pronunciation used is not the classical Latin pronunication probably in use at that time.  It is a later pronunciation widely used by the Roman Catholic Church and characteristic of versions of Latin that became the Romance languages.Although this is a remarkable dramatic work. even believers may need to be reminded that it is still merely a movie. representing or dramatizing. but of course not recording. real events. including Jesus' resurrection. just as a movie about. say. Lincoln's assassination would depict. but cannot actually record. real events of 1865.  Dramatic representations of the Passion are so commonplace that one would easily feel encouraged to think of it as myth and to forget that it all actually happened. in just one way. as real events do happen.  No photographs survive. not because there was no scene to be photographed. but because photography came along some 1830 years later.  However obvious this may be. I fear that it needs to be said."
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
4,"The visuals are certainly difficult to take in their entirety; whether necessary depends on the viewer. Mel Gibson's point in the film's graphic depiction was to show that Jesus did not simply live and then die. Yes. this seemingly accurate portrayal is quite narrow in scope but the viewer must admit that by the film credits. or even if they are able to see it. The Passion has delivered it's message. Also. Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern deserves an Oscar as Jesus' devotional mother while she holds every ounce of pain and suffering any human soul could bear in her facial expressions.One relevant footnote which occurred in filming the lashing scenes: Jim Caviezel states he nearly passed out when only one of the strands of the whips accidently caught him on unprotected skin."
4,"Lets face it the film is a gore fest. but i have seen worse and the only true gruesome scenes is when Jesus was whipped. he faced so much and agony by Romans and civilians in those days. Even if they say the Jews killed Jesus. it should refer to the Jews two thousand years ago. not the Jews living now. The film dipicts the Devil the best i have ever seen. The evil the devil presents show why he is the true enemy in this picture. Jesus may have suffered but he wins and in a way defeats Satan. Even if your not catholic you can still watch this film. the gore is the only aspect that makes it rated R. Yet i was dissapointed with the ending becuase it was too quick with the resurrection."
4,"IF I EVER RAN INTO MEL GIBSON SOMEDAY. I'D HUG HIM WITH ALL MY MIGHT! NEVER HAS A MOVIE TOUCHED ME SO MUCH AS 'THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST' I HAVE BEEN DEVOUTLY RELIGIOUS EVER SINCE I WAS NINE YEARS OLD. I KNEW WHAT I WAS IN FOR WHEN I WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE. AND YET I WAS STILL CRYING AND SHAKING FOR THE TORTURE THAT JESUS WENT THROUGH. HE WAS HANDS DOWN THE MOST UNSELFISH AND LOVING PERSON TO EVER GRACE THIS PLANET. I HOPE THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WATCHES THIS MOVIE. AND I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY. WE ALL LIVE BY WHAT GOD WANTS."
4,"First off. not ALL of this movie made sense to me. I don't know really what to say here because everyone else has already said everything. Some of the beginning made a little sense because I have seen 'Life Of Brian' which is the exact opposite of this film. So I might have learned some things already. I do have many questions about it. though. I get why so many people were offended. Because Jesus sinned in some way. Throughout the movie. he kept praying that he. along with a few other folks would be forgiven. but THAT'S where I get confused. Oh well. I'm surprised I did understand SOME things. and yet. it's very interesting."
4,"There is one incredible scene in this movie - a scene that perhaps makes the entire movie worth the price.  It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother.  In that scene one can see a Jesus of love. humanity. and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name.  It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful.  It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make.  Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations. essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity."
4,"I think people are just shock to see somebody playing Jesus Christ in a R rated movie that's why all the controversy cause theirs lots of other different videos out their having Jesus in it this one is just the first to be rated R. The reason for that is it has to be more realistic thats the whole point of doing a great movie and besides all of this realy happen to him years ago. What was a disapointment. Mel Gibson didn't even get nominated for an Oscar for best director let alone win one that is a big disgrace. well who needs a stinking Oscar at least he won a 'People's Choice Award' cause it all about what people want."
4,"After all of the thousands of words. arguments and heated passions that this movie has inspired since long before its release. it is a real downer to find out. upon viewing it. that it is a crummy movie.  The subject matter -- the final suffering and crucifixion of Jesus Christ -- could not be more compelling. even for non-believers.  But somehow Mel Gibson has managed to squeeze so much slow-motion blood out of the proceedings. without giving us any context for the character of the actual man. that the story is oddly passionless.  And talk about over the top!  The beatings. mutilations. and general bloodletting are so graphic that they teeter on snuff -- match this with the ridiculous horror-movie images of a slithery he-she as Satan. and you've got what could best be described as a gore-fest.  Yuck.  The two stars are for Jim C.. who suffers nobly in a very realistic prosthetic nose. and the cinematography. which is at times lovely."
4,"Having been forewarned by reviewers and friends that saw this movie in theaters I was prepared for a very bloody and a very very violent film. Since I really didn't need one and a half hours of splattering blood I waited to see this film 'when it came out on DVD' .....Yes the film was violent. but certainly not gratuitous ... Unlike Schindlers List where the director filmed in black and white to dull the graphic vilence of that film. I didn't get the feeling that 'The Passion' went over the top .....Not being a biblical scholar I was taken back to remember passages of the bible and the film pretty much depicts what I remember being taught when young.A point of aggravation with this DVD however was the subtitles which had a tendency of disappearing causing me to stop the film on several occasions to reactivate the subtitles ...Certainly a better DVD than I had expected ... Bravo Mel Gibson !"
4,"This movie is very very cool.  I for one will be honest and say I dont like to go to church. and im really not into anything spirtual. but I HAD to see this movie.  This movie is one of the few movies that I was about ready to cry watching it.  Mel Gibson did a very fine job showing what Jesus did for his people.  This movie actuly scared me in some scenes which added to its value.  This is one of the few films also that when I got up to leave the theater. I look around and half the audience is still sitting in there seats. looking blankly at the screen.  Props to James Caviezel for his outstanding portral as Jesus.  He did an unbeleavable job for that kind of demanding role.  Well worth the price of admition and dvd."
4,"if it wasn't as long. tedious. or overly violent.  Look at the Bible films that were done in the past.  They weren't a bloodbath. yet kept you enthralled with good pacing and editing.  Those films were perfectly adequate and conveyed the message of Jeseus.The Passion. however. hardly said anything of his life or teachings; they assumed that you knew all about him. and just focused on depicting his death.  So if anyone wants to watch Christ get whipped senseless. scouged 100 times. and beaten to a bloody pulp. see this movie right away."
4,"Not Just because it was one of the first movies out in 2004. but also because it is really good.  Jim Caviezal gives a great performance and should definetly be nominated.  The story here is not a bible fairy tale. its a story about jesus's personal suffering. its definetly not antisemtised. its not about that. and who really cares. its about what jesus did for everyone.  Its violent but when you hit someone with broken glass and nail him to a cross what do you think is gonna happen.  Its intense and dramtic. everyone in the theater cried.  See this movie it will make you think."
4,"A brutal portrayal of the death of Jesus. Very violent and graphic. There was not much to this except someone getting beaten. and beaten. and whipped. and whipped with razor-tipped whips. then beaten and whipped again. Then he musters up the energy to carry a cross and then gets nailed to it.The guy who played Jesus did a fantastic character portrayal. He was in another movie I watched and of course I did not recognize him as the same actor in Passion.My major complaint lies in the fact that most of this movie is based on beatings and torture. Hostel is kindergarten compared to this! Maybe show a bit of what else Jesus did in his life."
4,"I would have liked to seen more to this movie other than just the beating. I also hate subtitles. I don't care if they were trying to make it accurate to the dialect. I don't like to go to a movie to pay to read. to me it defeats the purpose: i could read a book. Had lots of gore. for that I gave it an extra star. For the repetitive scenes over and over again. I subtracted several stars. You know what kills me. Conservatives and religious people bash violence in movies and video games. but it seems as if it is ok to put this stuff in as long as your talking about Christ. Hypocrisy = religion do as I say not as I do. right? and stay away from those alter boys!"
4,"That's the way I'm sure a lot of people are feeling tonight after watching this.  I'm outraged by the completely ignorant criticism that Mr. Gibson has had to endure regarding the making of this film.  It's history. folks; if you don't like it. that still won't change it.  This movie portrays the events as they happened & it was probably actually worse than this extremely brutal portrayal.  It will shock you. but it will let you see firsthand what the Lord went through to redeem us.  Fairy tale?!?  Who would make up a fairy tale like this?  James Caviezel is great as Christ!  The sets & attention to detail are wonderful & the use of Aramaic only lends to the authenticity of the film.  If this film doesn't move you. you have no heart!  God bless you all & remember how much he loves you (John 3:16)."
4,"This movie is not for the faint of heart.  However. any other film maker probably would have made this movie so unbelievable that viewers wouldn't know how vicious Christ's death was.  Mel Gibson lets us see exactly what it was like 2000 years ago in Israel.  No sugar coating or anything artificial.  Gibson doesn't hold back and leaves no stone unturned.  Gibson captures the essence of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for us all.  Not to be  preachy. but I hope those of you who watch this movie know about the life Jesus lived and appreciate his sacrifice for our sins.  This movie hits home and is clearly the best film of 2004."
4,"Oscar Wilde once wrote. 'Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new. complex. and vital.' 'The Passion of the Christ' is almost beyond criticism; it doesn't really matter whether I or anyone else liked it or not. but the division manifest amongst its critics tends to support Wilde's conjecture.  From an artistic point of view. the film is completely uncompromising: the acting is inspired. the cinematography is brilliant. and the music provides a strikingly appropriate accompaniment to the visual imagery. The film is filled with rich symbolism. moments of heartrending beauty. and of course. disturbingly graphic and brutal acts of violence. One watches this movie with a combination of wonder and disgust. It is certainly not enjoyable to watch. but. rather. quite painful. but the spiritual reward reaped is well worth the suffering required to attain it. Highly recommended viewing."
4,"This film was a bad film based soley on entertainment value.  I don't see the necessity in a gore fest where Jesus Christ is involved.  If there were any FIRST hand accounts of this brutality.  this film may have more substance.  Seems that Gibson has his own spirituality on his sleeve.  I don't think that creates art or has any entertainment value.  Certainly blood and unrelenting violence is NOT entertaining.  Nor does this film have ANY artistic value.  The dialect isn't presented well here either.  The Aramaic voice isn't given justice here.  given the horridly poor interpretation and it's presentation.  This film is trash.  Simply.  God bless."
4,"I was afraid when I saw this movie.  I was told it was just a bloody massecre and too focust on the death and not the reserection.  However when I saw this movie I wept.  Mel Gibson did a fantastic job with flash backs. acting. and the death.  I did not even notice the fact that it was in latin.  This movie made me happy in the whole scheme of things.  You need to go see this on a sunny and happy day so you wont be depressed.  Watching this movie did not even seem like a movie but a look in the past as if I literally traveled through time and saw this tragety.  The Passion of the Christ was too perfect and I will never see it again."
4,"I am not Christian. But I read bible many times and saw many movies to know the life of Jesus Christ. After thinking of Christ many times. his life and kindness influenced me a lot. Unknowingly I started keeping him in my heart always. He gives me peace. love and compassion. He shows the way of life to one and many.When I bought this DVD. I could not wait to reach home to see this outstanding breath taking depiction of the last part of his life. I loved the possible reality that has been shown and understood the human cruality/apathy very well even though I hated the strong violence in any form. But Jesus Christ's mission is truely accomplished and he is in hearts of the majority of the world. In my opinion. the life of Jesus Christ as depicted here makes more interesting and reaches more millions."
4,"I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it. thinking it was a film. not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals. you risk being burned at the stake. an act of love to purify your soul.This film.as a film. disregarding the topic. is a dog. A cheap 'B' grade. blood spurting. flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour. but won't bother."
4,"this is the type of movie I would definitly recommend it for first time viewer but on personal note I would also say I will never watch this again. the thing is despite its christ we are talking about. it is still very hard for me to looking at a man being tortured like a hanging lamb in the kitchen while is considering myself is being entained in a movie.. IT IS TOO GROSS! the fact is it goes beyond the line there are anything horible things you ve seen in movie theater. that's what credit this movie as one unforgettable one in history. By comparing this to Hannibal. Hann is barely just a little kid's nitemare. Every minute of this movie chanllenge your sense to tolerante the scale of brutality upon someone to a new level. I would say if your a believer it could work better since the man you looking at aint normal human to you after all. so its more relief since its a 'super being' is tortured but not human like you and me..."
4,"Passion of the Christ is Mel Gibson's crowning achievement. It is strictly from the biblical account but where the scriptures are silent. Gibson's imagination adds to the experience as it literally brings the viewer to the Garden of Gethsemane and walks us through passion of Jesus Christ. Using biblical languages adds to that experience all the more that even if we dont understand the language. we can still follow the story. We can see the close bond between Jesus and his mother. the struggle of faith of his apostles and we can even sense why it is many were opposed to the Christ. There is love and hatred. fear and faith and we are left an emotional wreck trying to contemplate this great mystery of faith."
4,"I have both version's of the Passion of the Christ. But the Definitive Edition is better because it take out a few scenes. One part that isn't in this edition is right before the flogging scene starts. the 2 guards that bark in each other's face isn't in this film. This movie is highly emotional because it's the truth about what really happened. If you're looking for answers in life then please watch this film and then turn your whole heart.life. and soul to JESUS CHRIST THE WAY. THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE (John 14:6). God bless to all who watch this film."
4,"Despite reading much criticism of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. I find the film to be a convincing re-creation of the world in which Jesus Christ lived and of the Roman oppressions that inspired Hebrew resistance and ultimately Christian resolve to re-create civilization using communitarian rather than totalitarian models.  Dialogue spoken in a language used by ancient inhabitants of the Middle East also lends the film verisimilitude.  Christian orthodoxy insists that acknowledging the miracle of Christ's Resurrection is crucial to Christian faith. but to ordinary Christians. contemplation of Christ's unjust execution motivates commitment to Christian congregational charity more strongly than any assertion or proof of Christ's divinity.  THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a fine contribution to a genre that dramatizes Christ's appeal to suffering peoples in many times and places."
4,"The Most conteversal film of the year is also one of the best. a brilliant but tragic film. I Still liked Braveheart better .but this is a triumph for Mel Gibson. I saw this movie in theaters and this is the first movie I've seen in another language and english subtitles. This film is one of highest grossing movies of the year. I recommend this movie. you might think it will be boring. so did I .but once I saw it really wasn't boring. If your into gripping epics. then this is a great one. If your only into happy feel good movies then of course ignore this one. If you liked Braveheart I say see this too. experience the Grace. the Power. the Passion of this gripping epic starring Jim Caviezel."
4,"Look I respect Mel Gibson and I think he's a great actor and has done some great films but this movie was just totally pointless and I frankly don't see the appeal. I don't at all think it's anti-semetic or too violent but to me it was just pointless and boring. I can't see how anyone would find this to be moving or inspiring. For one thing. all they focused on was the beating and crucifiction. They never focused on Jesus's life or his teachings. or accomplishments. I consider myself to be a Christian moderate and I don't believe in everything the church preaches but with all the hype around this film. I expected more. I frankly want to know what moved or inspired anyone here because this was nothing more but a two hour snuff film disguised as something with a spiritual message. I understand the point of showing the gory details to try to convince people to change thier lives but the fact that it's fake really takes away from the effect."
4,"The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray]This film (and particularly the extra disk) is very useful for those particular individuals of the Christian faith who were not given the opportunity to learn about the finer aspects of Christ's Passion. specifically the Stations of the Cross.  Having grown up in the Baptist Church. I was not taught about the Stations. but strict emphasis was given to why Christ gave himself for us.  Additionally. the second disk amplifies the finer aspects of crucifixion. shows where the Stations of the Cross supposedly were in Jerusalem. and Christ's suffering as depicted in the Arts.  It is for these reasons that I recommend this disk set.  Whether or not one accepts Mel Gibson's interpretation of the Passion of Christ is up to the individual and how/what he/she believes."
4,"I am giving this film an extra star (moving it up to 2) because of the fine production values and amazing gore effects.  This movie is great for people who loved the 'Saw' pictures. just for the agony and torture.But seriously. why is it that so few people object to the idea that extreme violence is sacred somehow?  We have been taught for centuries that there is something divine about violence. and that cruelty is something that God (or the Big Whatever) needs in some way.  We have even been taught to equate a demand for horrible violence with God's love.  Is it any wonder that we have so much violence in our society. against people.animals and the environment?  How 'bout that karma! Well. enough of my soapbox.  If you believe in a bloodthirsty sadist in the sky. then this one's for you!  Don't forget the popcorn!"
4,"Christ is to Adult...as Santa Claus is to Child. What kind of sick mind would let their kid watch this pornographic trash? The kind of person who thinks 'Jesus' is going to 'come back'. The type of person who believes MILLIONS are going to 'HELL'. if they are 'unsaved'. The fact that this MYTH of Jesus and the Bible continues to hold sway the world over is nauseating. This religious nonsense has gone on long enough. Throw this sick fantasy away and instead use common sense."
4,"I think the movie could be a 5 star movie . But having to read everything that is said is a little bit too much you might miss some of the film . Mel Gibson I never thought you would release this in the US and not have it in a english version. I hate to have to read all of the movie .I like to just sit back and relax and enjoy the movie . It would be a very big plus to release this one in english . For those who dont like to read movies . May as well just get the book!"
4,"I LOVE this movie So much!  I don't care what kind of trouble Mel Gibson is going thru in his personal life. this movie is really a masterpiece!  It really gets across how much our precious Lord really did suffer for us!  This film makes me want to cry. scream. but mostly it makes me want to CHEER!  And I did!  When I saw it in the theater. and it went off. I yelled 'NO!!! DON'T GO OFF NOW!!!'. but it did.  At least we Christians know the rest of the story-WE WIN! PRAISE OUR LORD JESUS!"
4,"Passion of the Christ is the most controversial film of the year.  It focusses on the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ and nothing can quite prepare you for the amount of gore shown.  It is apparently 100% factual. but do we really need to be shown so much torture on screen - it simply went on and on and on.  It was so graphic that we all had to keep looking away.  There is more blood than you will ever see in a horror film.  But it doesn't end there.  Whiel carrying the crucifix. we are subjected to the beatings that Jesus received along the way.  There is a difference between implying it. and showing it.  I just felt that Mel Gibson went for the shock angle. and subjected us all to far too much gore.  Factual or not. there is no need for so much gore on a screen.  This is not how Jesus would want to be remembered."
4,"He did it for me. and you. No matter what your beliefs. our sins placed Christ on that cross and I. for one. am glad everyday that he did. Is it violent? Yes and that's the point. Crucifixion isn't supposed to be pretty or pleasant or easy to watch. again that's the point. No one else in this world would or could do what Jesus did for us. 'The wages of sin is death' is what the scripture says and he died that physical death because we could not and he knew how  badly we would mess up this world 2000 years later. This is a stunning. life-altering film that EVERYONE should see at least once. Don't miss it."
4,"When I had first popped this into my DVD player. I had a fairly good knowledge of what events I was going to see. I had no idea on how in depth Mel went into it. The movie was in fact word for word of what really happend. The acting was teriffic. The actors really convince the audience of what is going on. And of course the directing was great. Mel did add a little with what I thought was the anti-christ when satan was holding that little child. And yes. Jesus did suffer that much. He was not killed from the suffering because the bible says that 'no man will kill me. but I will yeild my spirit.' So in all. the movie was great. and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
4,"You fools so you beleave in god well your being played like a puppet on a string.If you look at the size of our plannet compared to the rest of the known univers it isn't even a grain of sand on the eaths serface.So if  your going to beleive in something as stupid as jesus and god you might as well beleive in something slightly more relistic like aliens.This movie is a prime e.g of how stupid the masses realy are and how thay can be conned into almost anything.If your going to rent or buy a religious movie i suggest Monty Pithons Life Of Brien it makes a hell of a lot more sense."
4,"Cuba Gooding. Jr does a wonderful job in potraying Dr Carson.  There is so much he had to overcome. non-believers and racism.  But with love and faith he outshone them all!!  When someone believes in miracles. all they need is a chance.Kimberly Elise is simply  wonderful as his mom.  Simple yet strong.  The faith she has in her two sons comes through as heart-warming and true.&#34;Gifted Hands&#34; is much more than I expected.  I read the book and was touched immediately.  The movie brings all those feeling to a higher level. This would be a great gift for those in doubt of their potentials.I had a lobectomy in &#34;02.  The book really shows the depth. emotional and physical.  of such a procedure.I will be watching many times over.  A must have.angie"
4,"Exceptional film that should be in every household.  Here is Cuba Gooding Jr. doing a masterful job portraying a man who faced down his challenges. (and they were formidable). and showed how a champion lives his life.  Held strong by a devoted mother. the hero of this true story shows that the only thing holding YOU back from success and a life of meaning is...YOU.I would buy this now. and share it with my family. many times. and then give it to every friend that I truly care about.  Then look in the mirror. and tell yourself. &#34;Yes. there is indeed a hero within me as well.  No one will stop me now!&#34;Do so. all of us. and make the world shine!"
4,"I have no idea how much Hollywood was added to this movie and to what extent the life and times of Ben Carson were glossed over or idealized. What I do know is the movie was emotional. inspiring. powerful and very touching. This is the story of a young boy who overcomes great odds to succeed in life and make a significant contribution to society.It is also a touching story of the love of a mother. her dedication to her two sons and her strong determination to see they had the opportunity to be the very best they could be. This is an excellent movie for the entire family and I strongly recommend it to all."
4,"BUY IT!!!  I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him. That was before I knew his life history.  I was surfing to watch a movie (any movie) and came across &#34;Gifted Hands.&#34;  As I watched it. I found myself saying what an incredible story it is.  This movie will inspire you.  I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children.  It's very. very good.  I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children.  She agreed that it's the best docudrama she ever saw.  She is inspired and acting on what inspired her.  My husband (not a movie fan) watched it from beginning to end without complaint!  IT'S GOOD!"
4,"I got this video knowing nothing about Dr. Ben Carson except what was written in Amazon's product description.  I like medical history dramas & I lkie Cuba Gooding Jr.  Previously. he starred with Rober DeNiro in 'Men of Honor'. another true life story of a real person.  He did a fantastic job in that other role. playing Carl Brashear. a Master Chief Petty Officer/diver & the first black diver in US Navy history.  Cuba did just as fine a job portraying Dr. Ben Carson. a renown neurosurgeon.  I watched this movie three times before writing this review.  I LOVED IT!  I also enjoy watching the special features & there was an interview with the real Ben Carson & with Cuba Gooding.  The directors have taken pains to make Cuba look as much like Ben as possible.  I'm glad I got it & sorr that three people thought it was a documentary - It is not - it is a movie."
4,"Ben Carson was more then just a gifted surgeon. but a man who had drive and ambition within him that he did not even know he had.  His mother was a great influence in his life and it shows in this movie about Ben Carson's life.  If you really want to know what drives a man then you need to get the movie.  You will learn that what he said at the National Prayers Breakfast was real and that is why the media has since launched a campaign to keep him from advancing his philosophy on life."
4,"This was a true story. and I love the movie.  The acting was wonderful and the message was super.  I saw this move awhile back and remembered it. and I found it at Amazon.com. so I purchased it.  This is one of those movies that give you hope. and shows how just because of circumstances beyond your control can potentially hold you down. there is always a way to climb up and prevail in your life.  Here was a strong. and determined mother who refused to let her sons think in a negative way about who they were.  She stood strong for their sakes and helped them believe in themselves. whereby they did.  When you think you are stupid. you will be; but. when you believe you are smart and have potential. you will.  Great movie and I am happy I now have it to see over and over again."
4,"Well produced script and story of the man we have come to know and respect as one of the great minds of our time! Enjoyable. considering all they tried to pack in from childhood to fairly current times of his life it flowed fairly well. These types of movies tend to be a bit rushed and corny but the writers.cast.director.editor etc. did a great job! I would recommend it as if focus' on his rise to becoming a downright genius of a surgeon etc. and skips his current personal politics so anyone can pick it up and enjoy it!"
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
4,"I most definitely do not agree with Dr. Ben Carson's politics. but I most definitely admire his skill. It's not a particularly great movie. but still worth watching. Actually. I purchased it because I really like Cuba Gooding Jr. and I was not disappointed in his portrayal of Dr. Carson. The rest of the casting is excellent. too. I can't say I love the movie because some of it goes a little slow for me. but there is always fast-forward! If you like biographical-type movies like this then. by all means. purchase this DVD."
4,"A story of inspiration.  Enjoyed this movie so much.  Excellent acting and being from the medical profession. I found the surgery scenes believable and realistic.  Never a dull moment.  Ben Carson is an American treasure who rose above poverty as well as other disadvantages to become one of the most well-known surgeons worldwide.  All young people should watch this movie.  His message of hard work. endurance and perseverence as well as faith. integrity and humbleness has such a positive influence.  What a contrast to the popular message of today...someone else is always to blame. the government owes us something. the education system is to blame for our children's failures..the list goes on and on.  I pray that Ben Carson or someone like him will one day be President of our United States."
4,"I love this movie. and Dr. Ben Carson. What an accomplishment his life was. and is. Overcoming poverty and excelling in the field of medicine. His mother had a beautiful soul. and she knew what a person could achieve in life. with dedication. and hard work. She seemed to know just how to direct her boys. Not only to excellence for Dr. Carson. but she herself overcame un surmountable obstacles. This movie shows what dedicated love. and trust can produce. I have watched this movie many. many times. Never tire of it."
4,"This is an inspiring movie about Ben Carson. the neurosurgeon who was the first to separate conjoined twins who were connected at the head. This is the story of his life from childhood on and how he (and his brother. as well) received victory over struggling with adversity and anger issues and went on to become successful. He owed his overcoming of trials to God and also his mother who encouraged them to never give up and to know they could do whatever they wanted to do in life. Ben Carson is a very gentle. humble. peaceful man.This is a great movie for youngsters. young adults. and older as well. Very inspirational story for anyone."
4,"This 2009 movie is based on the life of neurosurgeon Ben Carson from 1961 to 1987. starting with his getting failing grades at school. His divorced mother dropped out of school in the third grade. works constantly to support her family. suffers from depression. and has to check herself into a mental institution. Upon her return. she sees her two sons' success as hindered by too much TV. and so greatly limits the time they can watch. She also requires that they read two library books/week and give her a written book report. After moving to a better school and getting glasses. Ben becomes a solid-A student and is third in his high school class. Ben's achievements are rewarded with a scholarship and he later goes on to medical school. then becomes a pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins. (His brother becomes an engineer.) At the conclusion of the movie. Dr. Carson operates on two conjoined German babies joined at the head. saving both - a medical first. and requiring a 24-hour operation."
4,"Those of you who are not into true to life inspirational stories--please just move on.The rest of us who can draw inspiration from people who may (or may not) have had it worse than us. Gifted Hands is an excellent. wonderful story.I'm certain many others have chimed in the highlights of the film. so let me just say that the acting and direction was superb.  I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr. in many roles previous to this. and I have to say that this was one of his best performances.Atheists may not like this story. but if so. that's your loss."
4,"I was pleased to see in the extra features that Dr. Ben Carson was on-hand to advise in the production of this biographical retelling of his autobiography. He is a gifted speaker and writer. but I had hoped that they got the story right. Read the book first if you can; it's a page-turner. The movie leaves out some of the faith stories of Dr. Carson. making it a draw to a wider audience. But make no mistake. Dr. Carson credits God with all of his success. pointing out that it was his Christ-following mother that prayed for and encouraged him to reach his potential. taking him to church and teaching him in the way he should go--even as a single parent."
4,"Can't believe I'd never seen this before 2013...every middle school and high school kid should be REQUIRED to view this film once each day for about a year or UNTIL they stop wasting their lives playing video games. watching TV and 'hanging out' and. instead. are inspired to put forth as much effort as Dr. Carson did. If he can go from the 'dumbest' kid in his class. with a single mom. living in poverty and eventually achieve such miracles by his own hands...then anyone can do the same. There are millions of kids who are wasting their lives away who need to see this movie. Can you tell I LOVED it?"
4,"I have recommended this movie more times than I can remember since I first saw it.  As a retired school teacher. I would say it is a MUST if you want children to be motivated toward excellence AND it assuredly gives parents a much needed 'heads up' about how much time our children are wasting on anything and everything that is not preparing them for their future success.  A true story is always the best movie for me and I am so glad I have this one in my library.  I am continually getting it out to share with someone."
4,"I'm a teacher. and when I heard this movie was coming out on DVD. I was extremely excited.  Dr. Carson's life is so inspiring. and the message to students is very strong.  Reading and education opened up a whole new world for him. and as a result. the world is blessed with one of the most outstanding neuro surgeons in the world!  The additional special features also introduces you to the real Dr. Carson where he shares his personal story.  If you know of anyone who needs inspiration to believe in themselves. even when it seems everyone around them sees little hope for them. this is a great movie."
4,"What an encouraging story!  With all the odds against him. Dr. Carson came out on top with his faith and the teaching and prayers of his Mom.  If you are a single parent. I highly recommend this movie as a great source of inspiration.  The positive impact of a parent is so dramatically displayed.And if you are into details. be sure to watch the 'extra' information on the making of the movie.  It will really add to your appreciation of Dr. Carson and those who worked so hard to bring his story to life."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
4,"This is one of the best. and I mean the best explanations of creation without getting 'mushy' religious and anti-scientific. Often Christian views of creation are so anti-scientific and so prejudice that anyone truly wanting a balanced Chrisitan view that includes your mind is left out. This is the DVD for you. Challenging. thought provoking. even funny and entertaining at times. Rob Bell presents to you the best presentation for creation I've ever viewed. You won't be disappointed.I am presenting this material for viewing in a mini-series to and for non-Christian. seeking-the-truth people. I'm not ashamed to present this DVD to these people seeking God. yet skeptical and cautious of the Christian perspective."
4,"I cannot recommend this product enough.  There are so many things to say...it improves your sex life tremendously!  It helps incontinence!  And if you have organ prolapse and are scared that surgery is your only choice...THIS DVD IS FOR YOU!  I suffered for many months with a prolapse and was terrified of having surgery (have you seen all the commercials for attorneys suing for that very surgery?!).  With regular use I've been able to stave off the prolapse!  And my sex life has been so greatly improved because I'm not longer uncomfortable or in pain!  Don't hesitate!  HabIt is worth every penny!!"
4,"I love Olivia de Havilland. she is one my favorite 'Golden Age of Hollywood' actresses. I have seen her in movies when she was very young and the Studios made her do comedies. and she is precious in them. This performance is incredible. she portrays the personality of Rachel to a T. Is she a cold blooded murderess or isn't she? I have never been a huge Richard Burton fan. however. for his first movie. his 'over the top performance' works well here. He comes across very brooding. and is he obsessed with Rachel. or are his fears well grounded? I would recommend this to people who truly like mysteries. In my opinion the only reason it is not quite as good as Rebecca is because Alfred Hitchcock unfortunately did not direct it!"
4,"I loved it-I had seen this movie many years ago and loved it then&#62; I love Richard Burton-He's so deep in this movie-very young and very deep. What a brillant actor he is and became.I gave it five stars because the quality of him overall deserved it.Olvia De Havilland-wow what a brillant star she is. Between the two of them-wow! how different they are-but this movie brought a side we never saw before.Thank you -for the opportunity to share my views."
4,"This one is a classic in hiding - overshadowed by other more marketed ones. like 'Rebecca.' There are similarities. Gentler noir. but noir it is. It leaves one with an obvious question -- was Rachel twisted or not? Heard it said that the author never decided that. just created the intrigue for the reader to determine. My take is that Rachel is so much a child of her particular European culture. being so adverse to the English mindset. that she appears more of an exploiter than she actually is. Nevertheless. it is an interesting story. The movie with Burton/deHavilland is very well done. quite compelling. Recommend for all interested in the classics and the slighter noirs."
4,"Surprised this didn't make a bigger release and it's only available in limited quantities from Twilight Time. I bought this after hearing this movie was based on a novel by Dauphne Du Maurier who also wrote the classic &#34;Rebecca&#34;. This movie I found is almost just as good as Rebecca and is basically about a man bewitched by a mysterious woman. Performances from Richard Burton and Olivia De Havilland are great and it contains maginificent Oscar Nominated black and white cinematography and a haunting score by Franz Waxman. I recommend this movie to all movie buffs and you better hurry and get it before it goes out of print."
4,"Olivia de Havilland is at her best in My Cousin Rachel. I happened to catch this movie on TV and had never heard of it. I searched for it and found it and just had to ad it to my collection. Rachel is Manipulative. Deceptive and Conniving or isn't she? A black widow Spider. she mates and she kills or does she? This movie had me pulled into the story because you love Rachel and yet you hate Rachel. Olivia was a powerhouse and all the reason to see this movie. If you are a fan of Olivias then take a chance. this one will become a favorite for you as it did for me."
4,"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities. we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love. I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan. you might also want to try Hardware Wars."
4,"&quot;George Lucas in Love&quot; is the funniest eight minute short movie that I have ever seen.  What if George Lucas. the creator of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. had a muse. like &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; suggests that the Bard did?  Well. imagine George Lucas living in a dorm at USC. struggling to create a short picture.  And then the fun begins.  This short is laden with layer after layer of inside jokes.  I've watched it over a dozen times. and each time I see another joke that I missed before."
4,"Wow! During the 9 minute span of this short film. these folks were able to throw in every Star Wars/Lucas joke possible (even the low-blow &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; joke before the credits). &quot;George Lucas In Love&quot; is some wildly funny and entertaining stuff! The character swaps keep the humor moving. yet the nice production gives the film a professional gloss.For people who are still uncertain about plucking down some cash for a 9 minute DVD. the extra shorts appearing on the film are fairly entertaining as well! &quot;Evil Hill&quot; and &quot;Swingers&quot; are slightly less affective than the feature. but very funny nonetheless. &quot;Film Club&quot; was just. . . silly! The tons of extras included also add to the viewer's entertainment factor."
4,"This parody on &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; mixed with &quot;Star Wars&quot; is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time. he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately. the script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is all about him. he only needs to open his eyes and see it.The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.The DVD is well done. but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching."
4,"I remember clearly when Hardware Wars came out. with my sister and me howling with laughter at the clever parody. We loved Spaceballs. with its jabs. too. Being a great fan of both the Star Wars trilogy and of Shakespeare in Love. I was laughing out loud at this deft combination of the two done in a mere 9 minutes. It's like the super-fast-Shakespeare spoof which is making the theater rounds - a blast to catch all the subtle innuendos!What's the cost for the video - about the price of a Big Mac these days? I'd gladly pay double for the fun this has been at parties and when friends come over. I don't have this much fun with a lot of commercial sludge that's out on the big screen. that's for sure! Well worth it ... but see for yourself!"
4,"Being a long time Star Wars fan. this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.This is not a spoof of Star Wars. but rather a spoof of  &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. with a Star Wars theme to it.I give  this one two thumbs up."
4,"GEORGE LUCAS IN LOVE is a parody of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; featuring the life of a 1967 George Lucas in USC film school.  This film is less than 10 minutes long. but manages to cram joke after joke in. alluding  to many of the characters George Lucas has created for his films (not  limited to the STAR WARS films).The filming. acting. and score is  superb.  My complaint is similar to others: it wasn't long enough.  I also  feel like the script could have used a little more polish.  However. this  short film is a fun and diverting fantasy. adding another dimension of  folklore to the layered theories surrounding the STAR WARS series and its  much-revered creator."
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
4,"It is amazing how much like todays current events are leading in the same direction as this Soviet Story. It is also the story of the book of Judges. How easy it is for new generations to fall into the same errors as our fathers did. The impact on every generation and every nation is more than evident. Yet! Some how my generation didn't fully understand what took place in WWII our else they failed to instill in the succeeding generations the importance of submitting ourselves to the obedience of grace .To God's credit he hasn't destroyed us yet .He keeps reworking the clay into a image that seams good for him to make .what it should look like is in the mind of the potter. It is truly amazing how God uses every thing in our life to perfect in us all the qualities of the Christ ."
4,"The most important story apathetic Americans don't want to know.  We know through and through the sociopathic structure of Nazism as it pertained to attempting Genocide of the Jewish race. at least in all occupied territories yet we knew nothing of the Empire in the East whom inspired the Nazi Party and indeed it is difficult to find significant differences between the two totalitarian philosophies.  Shamefully. this documentary will be seen or believed by precious few in America before it's too late.  Communism was committing atrocities of the type Nazis did except they did for ~ 80 yrs.  Further. it's little known that Mao Zedong. murderer of as many as 80.000.000 of his own people who perfected the purge (of the committed ranks) long before Stalin adopted the tactic"
4,"This film is a must see. To little is known about the true ruthlessness of the Soviet era. As pointed out in the film it did not stop when Stalin died. American schools do not teach this and a recent column by Barry Rubin pointing out just how this has been glossed over and ignored by virtually everybody. Not only should you watch it but it should be shared with all who will sit for it.One critique I might have is when they go into Trotsky's murder they should tell you that he set up Lennin's secret policde and did mor than a little murder himself. He was no marter."
4,"Thanks to repeated government indoctrination and Hollywood &#34;political correctness&#34;. everybody knows the Nazis were bad guys who murdered Jews.But. there's much more to that story - - -This movie. &#34;THE SOVIET STORY&#34;. reveals how Hitler and the Nazis learned their extermination methods by copying Stalin and the Soviets. with whom they were formally allied for many years. and even after the war. the Soviets continued to use the Nazi concentration camps.Everyone needs to see this movie.I've bought extra copies to as gifts for friends and family."
4,"Nowdays.most Americans do not know who Stalin or even Hitler was(but they know 50 cent). so this movie would confuse most in the USA. Hitler and Stalin were both Communists and were basically on the same team. Marx called for the elimination of 'Trash Races' like the Lithuanians. Poles. Britons. etc. He said those races were too backward to be revolutionary ! So much for all of you 'Useful Idiot' commies. George Bernard Shaw is on the video calling for the development of a poison that would be humane and kill rapidly ( Zyklon B). A lot of information that would not be aired in the USA as it caused a big furor in Europe.The same Blood bankers that created communism then are still running London and Washington and this movie alludes to that."
4,"Blows the door open on Socialism for all to see.  We always suspected that something was not quite right behind the facade of the Soviet 'peoples paradise' and this film confirms it.  Some images are not for the faint of heart but are heart rending  in the brutality displayed. This film should be curricula in High Schools across North America.  Maybe then we could put this fascination and obsession about the glory of Communism to rest once and for all.  The survivor interviews were particularly touching.  Only a heartless b**tard or a devout Socialist / Communist could fail to be moved by the emotion on display.  A must see to fully appreciate the democracy we all enjoy."
4,"The Soviet Union brought a holocaust upon its own people through the imposition of Communism. and caused untold harm to other neighboring countries as well.  Although Stalin tried to get in bed with Hitler. with whom he had much in common. Hitler had other ideas and only then did the Soviet Union become allied with Britain and America.  This alliance of conveniences has caused many in the West to forget that Soviet Communism was just as vicious as German Naziism.  This film tells the unvarnished truth about the old Soviet Union. an institution which Russia and the world are well rid of.  RJB."
4,"Wartime alliances between the west and Stalin's USSR that seemed necessarily to defeat Adolf Hitler's regime only gave way to a regime worse than Hitler's.  It has been argued that the USSR and Third Reich were in a war of attrition that would likely have ended with both regimes bled dry had the US not entered the war and joined the alliance with Stalin.  Perhaps standing back and letting the two regimes annihilate one another would have been inhumane but perhaps it would have resulted in far fewer deaths than the subsequent rise of Stalin in a victorious Soviet Union.  In the end. the two. both insisting they were polar opposites of the other. were essentially the same devil.  This documentary traces the key points that demonstrate how Nazism and Soviet Communism are simply variations on the same theme.  A brilliant documentary that gives rise to a new perspective on 20th century (and particularly cold-war) history."
4,"The visuals were fascinating (did you know a hummingbird egg is the size of a coffee bean?) and the hatching was adorable. However. we gave up and watched it as a silent movie because the sound was annoyingly muffled and we could understand almost nothing of the narration. Why in the world didn't they (a) provide captions or (b) have someone else narrate it? Her voice is pleasant and soothing. but there was no point in listening to the narration at all; I wasn't even sure she was speaking English until I caught a stray word or two. I would have liked to hear the background music. but unfortunately. I couldn't because the sound was off. Frustrating! I am going to return it and get the one with F. Murray Abraham.I bought the DVD as a Christmas gift for my husband. I wish I had bought the book."
4,"If you enjoy watching birds. especially hummers. you will enjoy watching this incredible video. About an hour ago Mrs. Spudman and I watched First Flight and we were both enthralled. Through most of the video I was stunned by the sight of things I had never seen before like the tiny hummingbird eggs. the laying of the two eggs. the hatching. and of course the first flight of the two hummingbird fledglings.This video was three years in the making because of weather. missed shots and the hummingbirds' unwillingness to take direction. The film itself is a masterpiece and the short documentary explaining the making of the film was also quite interesting.  Also included on the DVD is a slide show of hummingbirds. The only shots of the colorful males are shown in the slide show.Honey. the mother hummingbird. built the nest and nurtured her young solo.We were disappointed the video wasn't a little longer. but like the hummingbird. beautiful things can appear in small packages."
4,"Actually. I would give this two scores--a 3 for those already familiar with Gettysburg and a 4 for those not. I can't give a score of 3.5. so I have rounded to 4 stars.For those familiar with the battle. little will be gained by viewing this--other than the very welcome bird's eye view of the battlefield. For instance. the coverage of Pickett's charge doesn't mention the involvement of Trimble's and Pettigrew's forces on the third day.For those not so familiar with Gettysburg. this will be a good introduction. A lot of details are left out. but the basics--from Buford's stand on Day One to &#34;Pickett's Charge&#34; on Day Three--are presented. The stories of Wesley Culp and Jennie Wade provide a certain poignancy to the DVD.So. nice cinematography. a plus. Basic description of the battle--a plus for neophytes and not so much for those familiar with the battle."
4,"As much as I would like to recommend this movie. I have to admit it is not one of the best movies of Jesus life. It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word. which is. at times. a useful tool.That said. the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.If you what the best Jesus movie ever done. nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.The two other parts to this series. Acts and John. are done very well."
4,"i have to say that this video series is AMAZING!  i am a very visual person so i found this very helpful.  as the story progressed it was actually happening on the screen.  i had heard that it took quite some time to get the characters cast.  but it was worth the wait!  the people that were in this set were just great.  i can't wait to see the other series - ACTS.  in fact. i'm going to tell my library to buy this set too."
4,"This is made word for word out of the Bible -the book of Matthew.  It is very well made and a great way to meditate on God's Word daily.  It never gets old and you will find yourself remembering Scripture by picturing the scenes that go along with the Scriptures.It show Jesus as the well balanced God Man out of the book of Matthew.  Some movies portray Jesus as some prune facedbeing -stern and cold.  This video doesn't do this.  It can be a great gift for others also.I have purchased quite a few copies and given them away as gifts.You will never go wrong with God's Word - The Bible.I will continue to buy it and I recommend it to everyone."
4,"Though there are 243 current reviews. none mention the special features on the DVD. which I was hoping to know before purchase. I rcvd my DVD today. and have not yet watched it. but thought I would post the Special Features: +)Languages: English and Spanish. English Subtitles; +)Search By Event. there are 99 bible story events in Matthew from which to choose that will take you to that place on the video. and show the Chapter & Verse numbers on the screen; +) Search By Chapter; +) Biographies. gives a brief bio of 6 bible characters (not actor bio); +)complete Soundtrack of the video (12 tracks). The Narrator is Old Matthew. actor Richard Kiley."
4,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie! We have three different movie portrayals of Jesus Christ. which are completely consistent with their respective Gospels. and we enjoy all of them. (Read my other reviews if you're interested in them.)The happy. laughing Jesus in this movie is intriguing. The way he speaks to people and looks at them warmly portrays his love for everyone. I think the actor really does a great job of portraying the duality of Jesus. how much he loves us. but yet that all is not hearts and flowers and warm and fuzzy due to the human condition.If you're looking for a great movie to share with friends. family. small group. etc.. this is it! Don't watch late at night because you'll want to stay awake!"
4,"I really didn't like the way Jesus is portrayed in this film because it shows Him more as being a human being who plays practical jokes on His Apostles and goofing off during His sermons than being the Son of God who came on earth to save us. Call me old fashioned. but I like the traditional way of portraying the life of Jesus in film. which shows Him as being compassionate. loving. and bold in doing His mission. and yes with a sense of humor. but at the same time taking serious things seriously. I have to say that I liked the Jesus of Nazareth film and 'The Passion' by Mel Gibson. much better."
4,"'The Visual Bible: Matthew DVD' is a visual Bible using the 1984 New International Version translation of the gospel of Matthew with a 4 hour 20 minute run time. The dialogue and narration are directly from the gospel of Matthew. like an audio Bible. which means that events that Matthew didn't write about aren't shown. The costumes. settings. and actions attempt to give a visual idea of what it all might have looked like.I liked that the actors played Jesus and the disciples like real people would act. The actor played Jesus as laughing and joyful when someone is healed. sad when people reject His message. playful when teaching (as some of his teachings contain humor!). and serious when appropriate. This is the type of Jesus that would draw crowds--the Jesus I know from the Bible. It's not perfect. but I really enjoyed watching it. I'd recommend this resource as an enjoyable and thought-provoking way to 'read' Matthew."
4,"Most Reliable biblical movie. The Gospel According to Matthew WORD-FOR-WORD is in the form of a movie. If a movie is not word-for-word it is not biblical. It is Hollywood. i.e. the Devil. Hollywood versus the Bible. You choose what you will feed your mind with. This is my favorite movie of all the &#34;biblical&#34; movies I have. Part 2 to Matthew is Acts. also by Visual Bible and also word-for-word. I give them out as gifts. They are less offensive to unbelievers and the religiously lazy who has never even read their Bible."
4,"I have used this with my college and high school students and even down to my 4-year-old. All I can say is this is absolutely the very best video that I have ever seen on the life of Christ. Obviously Christ's life has been done more than once. but never have I seen a movie that actually used the exact words of the Bible. This production does. It is simply acted out word for word. and you can see the reference at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. I have personally watched several hundred people view this video. and I can attest that about a quarter of the audience likes to keep their Bibles open so they can follow along (at least occasionally). You can't do this with any other Jesus video. And the casting is marvelous. The spirit of Christ lives on. as He is not portrayed as stale and pious. Overall this is a refreshing look. and I highly recommend your investment for all ages."
4,"As I remember vaudeville wasn't in style until the early 1900 and yet here is Jesus doing shtick.  I do believe that he could smile and see humor in some situations but the Sermon on the Mount was not one of them.  I could only make it through 9:9 and had to turn it off.  Just too much levity for my taste.Joy and happiness should be in the heart. mind and soul.  Not external as depicted in this movie.  I kept waiting for the custard pies to start flying.But. in all fairness. the movie was beautifully filmed."
4,"Bruce Marchiano shines in this depiction of Jesus Christ. in the Gospel of Matthew - the Visual Bible. which is a 'word for word' walk through the entire Gospel.  Richard Kiley stars as 'Matthew' at a later age. and you see him speaking the words to a couple of scribes who are recording the words of Christ for posterity and future generations.  It is an amazing sight. and work of art.Marchiano. in a unique portrayal of Christ. draws us into the drama and emotion of the life of Christ. and we experience the tension and intrigue as He sets the scene for what is to come.  I recommend this film highly.  There are approximately four(4) installations of this series. and for a bargain. it can be gotten through some of these auction sites.  It's a definite for your film library!!"
4,"One of the first extended modern presentations of the life of Jesus was &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; starring Robert Powell. This one is the standard and measure of all other productions on the same subject. Bruce Marchiano. although very sincere in his efforts to portray Jesus. just doesn't have the &quot;gravitas&quot; of a Robert Powell.The one point in the Visual Bible's favor is it's dedication to following the Gospel of St. Matthew without any deviation. &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; on the other hand. has the advantage of being dramatically engrossing to a greater extent. &quot;The Visaul Bible's Matthew&quot; comes across as a truly committed and sincere effort. but having a serious disadvantage of amateurish production values."
4,"The Visual Bible Gospel of Matthew is excellent.  I love the acting and the way the Bible comes to life through the word for word script.  I found it very inspiring and helpful.  My four daughters and I have watched 'Matthew' numerous times and it always is benefitial.  I especially like the happiness that Jesus portrays.  We know he drew people to him. and the actor in this video has appropriate expressions and whatnot which make him very appealing.  Throughout the Gospel he is not always happy. of course. but is appropriate to the situations. happy. sad. angry. distressed. etc...  Jesus was very human. and this is apparent in this Visual Bible Matthew.  Jesus was also divine. and God's love shows through as well.  I really highly recommend this Visual Bible. Gospel of Matthew.Thanks!"
4,"I simply adore this movie! It is completely Biblically accurate. using a word for word translation from the Bible yet so highly entertaining. This is the Jesus I think of when I think of Christ. The actor does such a splendid job at portraying what I believe the true Christ would have been like. I've never seen a Jesus on screen better than this.The Visual Bible was a very appropriate name for this portrayal of the book of Matthew. It IS the Bible made alive visually. Don't miss this movie. Buy it NOW."
4,"I actually bought this same set many years ago and loaned it to someone. so I wanted to replace it.  &#34;Matthew- The Visual Bible&#34;. takes an unusual perspective by presenting a side of Jesus rarely seen in movies about Him.  He is happy. loving. accepting and warm to everyone around Him.  He is serious and passionate when confronting the &#34;religious&#34; rulers.  I like the fact that the words never deviate from scripture.This is actually has been a good video for our down syndrome daughter who is usually frightened by other real life Bible  videos.  It has made her happy about meeting Jesus someday because it shows His character as One Who really cares for those who are needy and hurting.  It helped her to understand that Jesus died in her place because He loves her.I strongly recommend this video to add to your Bible video library!"
4,"I loved this version of Our Lord Jesus!  I'm sure that Jesus must have smiled sometime :) This depiction may be a little too different for some to imagine. but I was surprised how fast I was able to adapt to his contagious smile which showed me joy at the message of the gospel.  Once again the visual bible series has done a remarkable job staying very close to scripture and staying clear of over dramatization which so often really destroys the story rather then making it better--you just can't beat the real story.  God bless those who made this wonderful movie."
4,"I have many copies of this movie. I pass it on a lot..I use it in teaching religion classes all the time..Jesus is not a solomman who walks around in majesty...He is a person who loves the people he heals.he laughs.he is charismatic.he cries...he isGod....He is the Jesus I always in visioned.....If you aren't afraid to take Jesus off his holier then thou shelf and placehim in the human world of laughter.love.and pain...and still be the Son of God. I suggest this movie."
4,"I bought three of these because the story is exactly from the bible. I used the Bible to follow the story. Why did I buy three? I have a son in law that every time I watched this. Jesus reminded me of him by his actions with people and his love of children. The other was for a neighbor who is not of my faith but has the same Christ likie values. I expect all who proclaim they are Christians. I bought this also because I am tired of looking at all the poisonous traditions on TV that is making the world more evil."
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
4,"We have purchased many copies of this to give away. and of course. have one for ourselves.  We first got our copy on video years ago and my husband watched it over and over while he was recovering from surgery.  The movie is a dramatized. word for word narration of the book of Matthew. using the NIV translation.  The acting overall is good. the scenery and costumes accurate.  I have to say. I was a little taken back by the voice of Jesus. played by Bruce Marchiano. and that bothered me at first. but I got used to it. and really enjoyed the movie.  Well done and highly recommended."
4,"This is MUCH improved from her first video. The music is not annoying. she's got good people demonstrating proper positioning. and I really like how she narrates instead of talking while doing the routine. I think more videos should do that! I love her opening prayer and how the moves really put me in a spirit of praising God.This routine just seems too easy. like for senior citizens. It's nice to do on a rest day to keep myself limber and for meditating on the wonder of God.I will look for her new power version looking for something more challenging for the muscles.  Keep it up Laurette! We all learn from trial and error."
4,"For those of you guitar music lovers. (mostly men. I guess). this is a great intro to three of the biggest names in guitar-centric music. More importantly. this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all. a great success. Just. please wear a closed shirt next time. Steve. You should be heard more. and seen less."
4,"G3 Live in Concert is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen!  Not only does it have the best guitarists on the planet but they all get to jam together at the end!!  Their virtuosity is a sight to behold!!  I am a fan of all three guitarists and I was in heaven when I saw this DVD chronicling their incredible talents!  Now don't get me wrong there are many fantastic guitarists out there but this concept of getting premiere players together is a great one!Their styles are so different yet you can see the mutual respect that exists among them as they all play together!If you're into guitars or guitar playing you'll be in heaven watching this DVD!!"
4,"Honestly. all individuals are born different from the other. In G3's situation the 3 of them have their own distinctive feeling & style in playing that would obviously lift you up from your seats and scream out loud the word 'Yeah'. That is why I would not and could not classify who is ranking no.1. 2. or 3 among them. Unless. if your head is inflated with fowl air then approach me and I'm 100% willing to deflate your pathetic medical case and grant you guarantees of cure comprise of 'Love & Respect'. Buy this Dvd because your in for a special treat."
4,"This is the first time I ever saw these three guys playing guitar. Satriani. Johnson and Vai. Each of them play 3 songs. and at the end they all unite and play together 3 more songs. This DVD is killer. The quality of the sound is just so good that you think you're listening to the CD. I sometimes turn on my surround sound and play this DVD and makes me think WOW! This is a must for any serious fan. or for anyone who loves guitar music. If I could give it a 10 stars. I'd give 10."
4,"If you are not an instrumental rock'n roll fan and your blood doesn't boil with some extreme overdrive and other guitar effects. this is not for you. If you are a rock guitar player. this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai. as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza. deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson. I have to say. has a very different personality. melodic approach. and technique from Vai and Satriani. but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better."
4,"Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai."
4,"After reading some of the other reviews I really don't have much more to add.  However in my opinion it's as good as the other's have said and then some.  I own three of these 3G concert versions. and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three.  It's too bad they didn't make that a tridition with all three. but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit....A good collection to own if you're in to exteremly hot guitar licks...."
4,"I might get ripped for this review. but i honestly did not enjoy this DVD at all. I bought it after reading all the reviews on this site. Did not really know JB before so i approached it with an open mind. I don't like his overexaggerated singing much. he seems to try to somewhat copy Marc Bolan (personal opinion) and as for craftsmanship on the instrument he seems adequate at best. The other guys look bored and i got the impression the only time they enjoyed themselves was during the heavier songs like 'kick out the jams'. The only song i liked was the last one 'hallelujah' but even that dragged out too much. A redeeming factor was that i aquired the DVD for a bargain and got almost all my money back when i traded it in at a different shop."
4,"To anyone who. like me. only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death. this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program. giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here. all the banter between  songs. the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent. two seperate sound  mixes. regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny."
4,"Wow. this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan. and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert. even if you dont know Jeff. is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album. and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great. try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"
4,"Here is your only chance to see the great talent of Jeff Buckley. live and in person.  Sadly. he lost his life in a swimming accident. and the world will be diminished. musically. by this tragedy.  However. some of his finest work is captured here.  This concert gives the viewer a chance to see a young talent ply his skills with pure artistry. His guitar is captivating. and his voice is haunting.  Give yourself a musical treat. and pick this DVD up.  The only reason I gave it 4. instead of 5 stars. is because of a digital flaw in the song Lilac Wine.  The program stalls in this song.  I checked on more than one DVD player. and they both manifested the same pause.  Other than that... a great buy!"
4,"I enjoyed this production of Don Giovanni. even though there are some aspects I did not like. The musicianship of everyone was excellent. The opera proceeded at a good pace. However I found the constant darkness overwhelming. even though the light background showing the city was very well done. Similarly almost all costumes were black. as if everyone. no matter what was happening. was dressed for a funeral. even those celebrating the wedding between Zerlina and Masetto. Although that is not their fault. Donna Anna. Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira appeared too old to make their passionate roles believable. The parts of Leporello and Don Giovanni were acted excellently: Leporello a servant. ambivalent. who enjoys. but then also dislikes his role; Don Giovanni: a very charming seducer. who can also be cruel. who does not care at all about the effect of his actions on others."
4,"Others who are more knowledgable than I have reviewed the content of this disk and I agree with them for the most part. Let me address the technical issues.  First the picture is mediocre at best.  This is a video source from several years back and it shows.  Things get lost in the blacks and the picture is very soft.  Second. the surround tracks are very disorienting with the voices occasionally issuing from the rear speakers for no reason that i can determine.  I would love to see these companies start putting out disks that at least SOMEWHAT live up to the capabilities of the format."
4,"As a musical family. my husband and I enjoy this video as much as my daughter does!  Members of Stomp and other Sesame Street clips show us that music is all around us--we can make music with anything!  All the rhythmic clapping. tapping. banging on pots (always a fun toddler activity). and singing really keep my 17 month old daughter enthralled.  We're thrilled. because my husband and I really hope she develops the love of music we have. Even if you're not pushing music at home. it's very entertaining for the young ones. and a good video to add to your Sesame Street library!"
4,"The cast of Stomp is a great addition to this DVD.  My daughter fell in love with it the first time we watched it and asks for it repeatedly.  More importantly. it is not overly annoying to adults.How I rated this DVD:* Educational value.  Since buying this DVD my daughter has become very interested in making her own music.  I have found her stomping. making drums from rubbermade containers. and trying to blow in bottles.  She is only 20 months old and I think this is very impressive since we have only had the tape a few weeks.* Entertaining to child.  Keeps her entertained through the whole video.* Entertaining to adults.  I can even watch the tape with her and not become mindlessly numb.* The DVD starts right at the menu.  No annoying commercials to sit through.* Cost.  The video did not break the budget.  It was reasonably priced."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
4,"Cast members from Stomp ! and characters from Sesame Street demonstrate that music. and particularly percussion. can be made and found everywhere.  Combining the Sesame Street habitat with animation and live-action video tape keeps the pace moving.  The variety of musical experiences is remarkable.  We see hand-clapping games and drumming by children. chanting.pot-and-pan banging. as well as  Stomp cast-members' inventive use of  everyday objects that include balls. paper bags and huge oil drums. There's a wonderful sequence  that choreographs cracking eggs and slamming doors.  It's a terrific tape and our 2-year old has gotten a lot from it.One word of advice for those with younger kids.  You may need to use your fast-forward button at times as some sections are perhaps too talky but that depends on your kid of course."
4,"We love this video. I love that it teachs my kids about babies. dogs. and farms. All three shows on this video are done very well. And I really can't say that with all Elmo's world shows. This video opens the way to talk to young kids about babies. dogs and farms. Which is great. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Elmo's World - Babies. Dogs & More! seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I'd say it's in the top 20 favorite videos of my daycare kids."
4,"My 2 year-old son loves almost anything Elmo. so this was a no-brainer.  This was the first Elmo's World DVD I bought for him. because he loves dogs and farms.  It turns out. though. that the baby segment is his favorite.  We like to sing along with 'Old MacDonald.'  Now that we have Tivo. I could have just recorded the last 20 minutes of Sesame Street every day. but this DVD was a nice addition to our library."
4,"I'm ten years old and I love Elomo's world. I mean I haven't watched in a year. When I'm bored it's fun to laugh at how funny. In my way of age. to see such a baby show. It's like teenagers watching Winnie the Pooh. They still like it.It's like for a period of time you are little and like it and then in like first grade you hate it and think it's babyish then in about 5th grade there are no more shows on and you just look on tv and you watch it. I laugh at those things todlers would would listen to. To me it's entertaining! LAlalala Elmo's world!"
4,"I bought this video because my daughter loves dogs and other animals.  I also bought it because there is a segment on babies - as we are having a baby in a few months. I thought it would be good to expose her to little babies.  My daughter this loves this video.  She asks to watch it multiple times every day.  Sometimes we have to hide it.  She laughts at Elmo and really relates to all the animals and babies that are shown in the segments.The video is divided into 3 full length segments of Elmo's World - one on babies. one on dogs. and one on farm animals.  My daughter loves each one.  Plus they are very educational.  If there is a new baby on the way. I DEFINITELY recommend this video as a tool to teach your toddler about babies.  It discusses how to play with babies and what newborns are like."
4,"My daughter doesn't watch much television. and when she does it is usually Dora. Miffy or Blue's Clues on Noggin.  So. I didn't know if she would be interested in this Elmo DVD when she got it for her first birthday.  But now I know that regardless of the main character. babies and doggies are a sure winner.  Watching the little kids play with the babies is my favorite part. and it really gets my daughter's attention.  All in all I do recommend this DVD.  It shows alot. but isn't too fast paced.  Also. there are some very adorbale scenes.  But by the time the farm segment starts my daughter has usually lost interest."
4,"Elmo is so entrancing. I have no idea how he does it. but when this DVD is on. my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo. I get some much needed 'Me time'...Although this DVD gets old for me some days. it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!"
4,"My son received this for his second birthday back in October of 2004 and it has become one of his most favorite DVDs to watch and is one of the 15 or so in his regular viewing rotation.  Kids love watching videos with babies and dogs in them and that's the theme of this DVD.  Elmo learns about what babies eat. how they behave and the joy they bring to their families.Then Elmo learns about dogs and how to feed and take care of them.  Mr. Noodle is along as he does one of his usual silly routines as he walks a pretend dog much to Elmo's and kids delight.The last part of the DVD deals with farms as Old Macdonald joins the fun teaching Elmo all about life on a farm.  Elmo learns about taking care of farm animals and growing vegetables.  This was a fun and educational DVD for kids from toddler all the way through early elementary school. done with the usual Elmo flair. songs and silliness.  A classic!"
4,"This kickboxing workout is wonderful!  It is very fast-paced. but yet it is easy to learn if you are new to kickboxing.  It is really the type that you can do at your own pace.  I have done Tae Bo before. and although it was a good workout. I found Billy Blanks EXTREMELY annoying.  I hated the way he &quot;preached&quot; throughout the entire workout.  This video is much more of what I am used to in an exercise video.  It is well worth the money. especially since the DVD version that I have comes with a 45 minute version and a 60 minute version (I don't know if the VHS tape comes with both versions). This is great to switch up your workouts.  This workout is very similar to TaeBo and I would recommed it highly to anyone who likes that type of workout.  It is also good for people who like Kathy Smith and want to try a new workout."
4,"I've never worked out to a DVD or VHS in my life. preferring to go to the gym and take classes. or to use exercise machines.  This DVD was so FUN and diverse. not at all boring or annoying.  Kathy Smith is energic but not overly so. and she avoids talking and counting constantly which I find distracting and irritating.  What I like is the customized option in which you can choose you work out length-- perfect for when you need to save time or when you want a more vigorous. lengthy work out.  You may find yourself flubbing through the first two go-rounds. as I did. until you get the hang of it. but once you catch on. you REALLY feel the burn if you do it right.  Good work-out for beginner or moderate (I'm a moderate) exercisers."
4,"I really wanted to buy a kickboxing video that would not be too complicated. As a user of other Kathy Smith videos. I decided to purchased this one. The moves are fairly simple and you can get a good workout. Unlike a lot of Kathy's other videos. there are no modifications for lower or higher intensity. but since it is not a standard floor aerobics video. it really isn't necessary to do so. If you are looking for something different to add to your routine. this is a good choice."
4,"I have a lot of fun with this video. I will admit. like a lot of other workouts. it takes some getting used to. I had to do this three times before I learned all the routines. There are very few workouts that I can pick up on the first try.Kathy Smith and Keith Cooke take you through every move and I don't think they are too fast to keep up with.  They stress to go at your own pace. anyway.  (Taebo is just too fast for me)The first time I used this video. my back muscles were a little sore. I also lift light weights (Kathy Smith's weight training of course). so I am used to using my back and arm muscles.I like this video much more than her 'Aerobox Workout'."
4,"I like this kickboxing workout because it is challenging. but also teaches you the kicks and punches that you are using.  It is my first kickboxing DVD.  I can tell that Kathy Smith isn't as practiced at kickboxing as the other two instructors are.  So I find myself watching them to make sure that I am executing the moves correctly.  This one takes a lot of energy. and on really high days. it has a challenge segment.  But I don't believe that it is as intense as TaiBo. from what I have read.The only thing that bothers me is that when I chose to do the challenge. the DVD plays the stretching segment first.  I have gotten the impression that it was not set up very well.  I end up having to manually chose the segments that I want to do.  Oh. it has a great Tai Chi stretching segment as well.  I just found that the other day."
4,"The moves are similar to those found in the Tae Bo routines.  However. the intensity of the workout is significantly less than the Tae Bo workouts.  This workout is great for the begginer or as a primer for Tae Bo.  Kathy  does a nice job with the instructions but performs akwardly compared to the  other instructors.  The music is decent and they are always in sync.  I use  the video as an alternate to Tae Bo either as a change of scenery or on  days when the energy level is low."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
4,"This is a tough workout.  The basic workout is 45 minutes and the challenging workout is 50 minutes.  If you're already in great shape. this will be a good workout for you.  If you're a beginner or intermediate. forget it.  This is something you need to work up to.  Kathy starts at high speed and stays at that pace.  Also. you have to learn the moves on the fly. which makes it that much more difficult.  Final analysis. good workout but only for advanced students."
4,"Holy cow!!!  I was completely drenched with sweat at the end of this workout.  I have a few of Kathy's videos and have always been pleased with her technique.  She doesn't disappoint here.  I have all of Billy Blanks  Tae-bo tapes and this so much better.  A very thourough warm-up leads into  a tremendous workout that keeps your pulse elevated and ends with a great  toning section for the legs utilizing the kicks you've just learned.  A  bonus ab work rounds out a perfect tape.  Also feautured is trainer Kelli  Roberts. from Cher's first video and the star of her own two excellent step  video.  Hope someone signs Kelli up for her own kickboxing tape!"
4,"i purchased this tape last night and reviewed it first then did the workout this morning. this tape shows good correct techniques and posture. which other tapes lack. you can do this tape as a beginner and be slow and  moderate or you can do it like me (a regular fitness gal) and do the moves  with more stamina and endurance. balance and coordination w/o hurting  yourself. the one thing i liked alot was they would do a move and show  Kieth Cooke on the side showing correct posture and correct stance. it is  upbeat. fun. good workout music and the moves are not hard to follow at  all. after 15 minutes. i was sweating like crazy. good good workout people.  try it. it's not boring or slow or annoying for that matter."
4,"I thought this was a pretty decent DVD. I guess the things I dislike about it are:- she messes up the counting sometimes- some of the little mini-routines are clumsy (for instance she'll have you stand there and punch with one hand really fast - what's the point?)- she's rude to Keith Cook (interrupts him. cuts him off. and clearly she favors the woman Kelly. the camera focuses mostly on her and Kelly)- if you watch Kelly. you'll injure yourself (I took lessons in martial arts for few years and Kelly does all these unnecessary gyrations with her hips that would cause her to fall over if anyone was actually there to receive her punches/kicks or punch/kick back. because she's so off center/balance)"
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
4,"I enjoyed it but was disappointed that even though i chose 55 minute option cardio- kickbox workout sort of stopped at 30 minutes. she then worked our legs for 5 minutes? Then that other guy did training of some sort that I skipped. then another training....which wasted 10-15 minutes and then there was cool down.  The good thing about this DVD is that you can select to play certain segments....only one segment can be played at a time though. Warm up was good. Good 10 minutes but cardio type with some stretches that I didn't do- I skipped rope instead."
4,"I started kickboxing with this video. only to find it too challenging.  Though Kathy instructs you on careful and precise movements and good posture. you are really better off going to a class first where someone not  only instructs you but checks that you are doing the moves correctly.  However. after learning how to do the moves correctly. this video is  excellent. though occasionally repetitive.  Kathy and her friend can be a  little bit annoying. but once you break a sweat. they are the last thing  you're thinking about!"
4,"You do not need a jumprope to do this video.  That review may have been thinking of Kathy Smith's boxing video - not her kickboxing video.  I own the DVD.  I find it to be an excellent workout.  I bought it after doing  Tae-Bo for six months.  After doing it. my legs were sore - an indicator of  a good workout!  It has some fun combinations. with some guest instructors.  It starts out with a 15-minute warmup. during which you will do moves to  prepare you for the kicks.  A long warmup is necessary before jumping into  heavy cardio.  Then. you start with punches. move onto kicks. and  combinations.  My only complaint is that the punching drills can become  boring.  If I lost my gym membership. I would begin to do this video at  frequent intervals again."
4,"Kickboxing workouts are a great way to work up a sweat and burn calories. This is a pretty good workout. Keith Cooke. the kickboxing expert that Kathy has on set is fun to watch because he has such good form and energy. Some of the moves and combinations go very fast and it takes a bit of practice to be able to do them. I tried the combos slowly at first and only went 'up to tempo' when I had the form down right.There is a slow kicking section for toning legs and balancing that I really liked.You get two workouts on this DVD--basic and challenge. Get a towel and some water 'cause you're gonna sweat!"
4,"I thoroughly enjoy this video!  It is easy to follow and gives a very good workout.  One of the things I really like about this video is the length of each routine.  Kathy gives you enough time to learn the moves. then practice the move. which lessens the risk of injuring yourself.  Beginners might find this video hard at first. but once you get the hang of it. it's a lot of fun!  And it's great cardio exercise! This video is definitely heads above the Tae-Bo series which goes at a very fast pace and doesn't allow you time to learn what you are doing.  Kathy Smith always does a great job researching whatever exercise genre she is working in and her choreography is very good.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes cardio kickboxing and wants a good workout."
4,"We love this DVD.  My son enjoys and asks for it frequently.  Highly recommend...my son loves to count things now!HOWEVER. I do have just one small complaint.  The 'chapters' are not clean...if you go to the chapter on the number 3 you get the tail end of 2; chapter 5 closes with the beginning of the next number.  This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.I have noticed that the SS DVD's (like Follow that Bird for example) don't have logical clean chapters....why?  It doesn't seem like rocket science to me..."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay. Ernie!"
4,"I am a mother of a 10 month old. She started watching this when she was 8 months old and just simply loves it. I can put her infront of the TV turn it on and a lot of times she will sit and watch the whole DVD! As you know for a 10 month old that is  unusually! But she loves it that much! I have a Nephew that is 2 years old and he just loves it as well! I recommend any parent out there that wants a educational fun Video/DVD for there child ages 6 months- 6 years this one is GREAT!!!!"
4,"Our two-and-a-half year old really got into this. but didn't like 'learning about numbers' at all. except for one little sequence that show 2 girls playing with a dollhouse. the two dvds are actually quite different: this one features elmo and ernie and feels very much geared toward children while 'learning about numbers' actually seems like they were trying to entertain children and adults at the same time by adopting a mock talk show format where big bird is supposed to be some kind of jay leno standup. plus there is a lot of 'The Count' in that LAN. and our toddler didn't like him at all!  Much better choice. I think. for toddlers. Only weakness is that they give short shrift or even skip over certain numbers between 1-20. Some kind of brainless editing decision by somebody who didn't get enought sleep. no doubt."
4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms. the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top. but with little kids. they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting. this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!"
4,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE KID'S VIDEO.  We originally borrowed this from the library.  We liked it so much. and I was so tired of having to return it after maxing out the renewals just to check it out again. that we decided to buy it.  The kids (2 and almost 4 years old) ask for it all the time.  I thought they'd be tired of it after a few months. but it still holds their interest.  The songs are a great compliation of really great Sesame Street production numbers.  We all sing along and. quite frankly. I can't get the songs for the numbers 3. 5. and 10 out of my head. The kids also like the bits with Ernie and Benny (don't call him bunny) between the songs which is usually when the kid's lose interest in this type of DVD."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
4,"Sure. it teaches them to be naughty and tease like Ernie teases poor lazy Benny. but it has a nice story line. and really teaches the numbers -- my son just starts dancing when he hears the title song sung by Ernie.  Lots of the songs are pretty good. and definitely stick in your head.  The great thing(imo) is that Elmo has only a small bit. and this video has firmly lodged Ernie as his absolute favorite Sesame Street Character!!!  He talks about tubby time and bath(not on this DVD though). and has learned some numbers (I think :-)) We have a laugh at Benny every time we watch. which is a few times a week -- would be 24 x 7 if it was my son's choice."
4,"This DVD was very advanced for my 18-month old. In Kids favorite Songs there is a lot of counting backwards from 10 to 1 which my kid loves too mimick (he still doesn't say much that can be understood) so I thought he would love this DVD. There is too much talking in the intro and it bores my kid as soon as it starts plus there is no Elmo. My kid loves Elmo and expects to see Elmo on Sesame Street. We are keeping this DVD for later when he is about 3 he might appreciate it then. Right now he has no interest in it whatsoever."
4,"This is a cute video with some catchy tunes ('one. two three. count with me. we'll count everything around us that we do and hear and see!'). It's not old enough to appeal to parents like me who like Sesame Street nostalgia and want to introduce their kids to the genius of Jim Henson. (Ernie. in particular. is without his characteristic mischief.) But. it's not new enough to be instantly recognizable to the kids of today. I'll put this video on without complaint when my daughter asks for it (she does like it) but it's not one of the first ones I reach for. I like the Count's 'Count It Higher' much better."
4,"My daughter is 19 months old and loves Sesame Street. But we were disappointed that she didn't like this DVD. She found the rabbit/bellhop character annoying and a little scary. He's kind of ugly and mean. and unfortunately he's the main character after Ernie. And her favorite character. Elmo. is only in one vignette. It was also too slow to hold her attention without more of her favorites like Elmo or Cookie Monster in it. She's learning to count just great without it anyway. so we'll probably just give it to someone else."
4,"I bought this video at the same time as I bought &quot;Do the Alphabet&quot; and now my two-year old nephew won't watch it.  He only asks for &quot;Bic Birt&quot; (Big Bird is on the box of &quot;Alphabet&quot;).  I've tried sneaking it into the VCR when he isn't watching in hopes he'll  get hooked. but he always asks plaintively for the other one.  Personally.  I think that they count a little fast for him while the  &quot;Alphabet&quot; tape goes pretty slow.  And Baby Bear is always a  winner.  I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little  older."
4,"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd.  And you know what?  I do. too!  There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs. all about counting.  All the songs are catchy and fun.  My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie. his friends. and Elmo. as well.  Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy. and I highly recommend it!"
4,"I would give this video 10 stars if I could-it is the most wonderful of all the S.S videos I have bought(and I have about 20) The characters are incredibly adorable. and make the process of learning the alphabet fun. not just a task for kids.Unlike a few of the other reviewers who think Baby Bear and his 'lisp' should not have been the focus. are being ridiculous-there are alot of kids out there with speach impediments who talk just like Baby Bear or even worse-I know of 3 in my daughters Pre-k class. Sesame Street shows kids in wheelchairs and kids with Down Syndrome on the show. I guess they should not be on the show either????So. I think he is a welcome addition to the video. Check your attitudes at the remote before playing the video for your kids if you feel that way-it may be annoying to adults-but it is what the kids can relate to and understand that matters."
4,"If you are going to buy one DVD for your child to teach him the ABC's... buy this one!  My two year-old loves this DVD and I have to admit. I enjoy it too.  He can barely talk but knows most of the letters of the alphabet.  He sings along and recognizes most of the letters and can sing most of the alphabet song.  I work with him. of course. but he's gotten a lot from this video.  I highly recommend to any parent of toddler or pre-schooler.  It is one you will watch over and over with your child and be amazed at the results.  The songs are fun.  You hear the letters of the alphabet over and over but in different ways.  Really great."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen!  Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own...PS - yay. Sesame Street!"
4,"My daughter. the Sesame Street fanatic. has begun singing her abc's because of this video.  She's 21 months old.  Big Bird and Baby Bear work on learning the abc's. Baby Bear wants to learn them because Goldilocks gets on his nerves. butting-in and finishing them for him when he gets stuck.  When Goldilocks pops in. it's pretty funny.  Not a good video if your child only craves Elmo though.  He does NOT appear in this video.  For everyone else. this is a cute way to learn the abc's and have fun with them at the same time."
4,"This video is a great. fun way for kids to start learning the alphabet. It's filled with good and catchy songs. entertaining cartoons about the different letters. good 'live' segments (as in using real people instead of being a cartoon). and a great story to tie it all together.My 16-month old daughter is already starting to sing along with the first song (ABC-DEF-GHI). dances along with the 'T-dance' skit. and beats her hands in time with the jazzy 'Alphabet Blues'. She still isn't really able to talk (not having a decent set of teeth yet makes it hard to say certain letters). but I have a feeling that once she does she'll be saying the whole alphabet in short order."
4,"My kid loves Elmo so I usually get Sesame street DVDs for him to watch Elmo. It was a bit disappointing that Elmo doesn't feature in this one. But he does get glued to it all the same with all the singing and dancing. In terms of educational content and approach to teaching the alphabet to kids. I think it's excellent and is quite entertaining too. The Alphabet support group idea adds a nice touch which I doubt my kid would understand now but had me laughing to bits the first time I watched it."
4,"I personally find Big Bird to be an annoying character. but this show is pretty good for helping to teach the alphabet.  I only rate it a 3 because it is not a show I enjoy watching with my daugher.  I also don't notice her laughing and being engrossed with the story the way she does with Franklin videos. Bear in the Big Blue House videos. and even Elmo videos.  I also don't particularly care for the Baby Bear character either. because he doesn't speak well (they have him speak in &quot;baby&quot; talk which means he mispronounces certain letters.)  We've had this video for about 8 months and my daughter never requests it anymore.  Maybe she's too old (28 months). but I doubt it.  She still loves to watch Sesame St. on PBS."
4,"This video does a great job teaching the alphabet - the conceit is that Baby Bear can't get all the way through saying the alphabet. while Big Bird and the gang help him learn it.  Having Baby Bear get stuck at a different letter each time really works - my two-year-old occasionally finishes the letter for him.This video has better between-clip production values than some Sesame Street videos - but die-hard Sesame Street fans will want to see it's songs like 'J Joe Jeans and his Jellybeans.' and. my favorite - Henson and Frank Oz as Ernie and COOKIE MONSTER doing 'D.'  An incredibly funny clip.So. this video does its job all the way around - teaches and entertains!  Enjoy!"
4,"When Baby Bear gets frustrated with Goldilocks for always interrupting his alphabet reciting. he turns to Big Bird for help. Big Bird must help him learn the alphabet in 24 hours. And he does. with the help of all the Sesame Street characters (and Billy Joel) and a new alphabet song! Forget the old way of singing your abc's ... this movie will change the way you sing it for good! So catchy! My daughter loves this movie. It's one of her favorite in the Sesame Street series. It runs about 45 minutes long and keeps her attention pretty much the whole time. Recommended for anyone with little ones running around!"
4,"The 2 20-minute workouts get 3 stars and the bonus section 5 stars.This workout is pretty easy to follow and I thought. Kathy did a very good job teaching each type of dance step in the first part of the workout. However. there are sections in the middle and in the second half that didn't flow well. It seemed that she was not in synch with the music at times. which was distracting. The music isn't that great either. Also. if you've ever tried the awesome Latin Xplosion with Carlos then you know. this just doesn't even come close.In the bonus partner dance section (without Kathy). one of the male and female exercisers demonstrate how to dance Salsa. Merengue and ChaCha. They both do an excellent. excellent job and make it look super easy to learn."
4,"This is a terrific workout -- fun music. fast paced. and very invigorating.  Kathy does introduce the dance steps quickly. and sometimes you might feel a bit lost.  However. BE PATIENT.  It will only take you a few viewings to get the moves. as they really aren't very complex at all.  The pay-off is worth the effort.  I'm 53 years old and have been doing step aerobics for over 20 years.  During the past 4 years I've had some injuries that have prevented me from doing the high impact step DVDs. so I had turned to Leslie Sansone's walking videos.  These are okay for days that I don't want to get too sweaty. but I wanted a REAL workout that would get my heart rate up in a FUN way.  This Kathy Smith Latin workout is just the right thing for me.  If you feel like Leslie Sansone is too easy. but high impact aerobics are problemmatic. then try this workout!"
4,"Well. my title say's it all. what a dissapointment. What you think your getting. you don't get at all. To keep my review as 'to the point' as possible. this looked like an amature video. First of all. they are wearing black pants in a dim studio so therefore it is really hard to see exactly what they are doing with there legs and feet. Secound. Kathy is all over the place with her movements and not in a benificial position for the viewer at times. There were times where she would introduce a new movement. and the camera wasn't even on her. She almost at times looked like she had forgotten that she was suposed to be 'teaching' this routine. There are also moments where she had forgoten in the original taping to que a new movement. so you will here an overhead of her voice. which is just so amature and cheap. I give this video 2 stars because it is not worth more then 2 dollars."
4,"Being half Hispanic I'm quite familiar with Latin dance. Both my parents have been dancing salsa for years. the old traditional style. that is. not the new age salsa based on the Latin Hustle of the 80s.Kathy does a good job. and so do the two very professional people framing her. I must say that I've read some of the other reviews and I simply can't understand why somebody would say such insulting things about Kathy's dancing. and even about the others. I understand people are entitled to their opinion but to say things like robotic dancer. clueless. don't buy this DVD. a total waste. and worse things.... Is it really that necessary to be that insulting? Kathy is a lady. and a professional."
4,"This is my first Kathy Smith video and I think my last.  While the music is fun and encourages you to move. Kathy Smith herself has the opposite effect--she is cold and out-of-place.  The workout is not by any means challenging--that was the reason I selected this tape over others.  However. if it THAT basic even for someone like me (not a lot of exercise experience. no dancing experience. and not particularly good coordination) and it is not that much fun. then what's the point."
4,"This workout is fun. fun. fun!  Kathy is as great as ever. the other instructors have big. natural smiles on their faces. and the whole class looks like they're just so darn happy to be there!  I am not a fan of sappy  enthusiasm and maybe that's why I appreciated the real energy of this  group.While I admit that this isn't the most grueling workout in terms  of fitness challenge. it is different. interesting. and fun.  I love the  atmosphere of the Conga room and the live band plays some fabulous music.  Don't expect to break a sweat or get your heart rate up too high. but if  you want to dance this is the video for you!Now if only I could find a  partner for the special instruction at the end.......(A million times  better than the CRUNCH Fatblaster Goes Latin video!)"
4,"I'm not fat but I'm pretty klutzy.  I assumed that this DVD would actually be suitable for a beginner to get the simple steps and then move along with; that they;d start with an introduction and then start an easy routine and move up to something more 'complex' but still suitable for a beginner.Their review on the steps were 3 small sections in the beginning that just slowed the video down (good luck basing your dance routine off of a slow down if you're brand new to it) and then jumped right into the routine.  For someone like me. who doesn't have much self esteem and feels stupid dancing alone in her room with the blinds shut...this doesn't help you feel more comfortable.  It makes you feel more klutzy.The warm up is easy enough though.And if you give yourself a few weeks to get the routines down. you'll probably be OK.It just wasn't for me though..."
4,"I have never had so much fun with an exercise video until I did the 'Latin Workout'. I was very impressed with Kathy and her assistants. The music was marvelous and very authentic. I love Afro-Cuban music. I really worked up a sweat. You can get a lot out of this video when you put more effort into the moves. This video is so enjoyable the time just flies by. I really had to get used to moving my hips. It felt so dirty but in a nice and sexy sort of way. I can exercise to this video everyday. So if anyone is considering starting an exercise program with a lot of fun. start off with this video."
4,"This video is so much fun to do! This is a video I can do without taking any water breaks 'cause it's just so much fun to do! The dances are easy to pick up. plus they're good to learn to do at any parties. Kathy gives good instruction. so it's very easy to keep up. Although I mention the word &quot;easy&quot; a couple of times. this workout is still very challenging. It gets your heart rate up. and you'll definitely break a sweat. But you'll be having so much fun. you won't even notice!"
4,"This is by far the best video I have ever done. especially for the fun factor.  And I have done over 50 exercise videos in my time.  If you are an intermediate exerciser this is a must have.  I can't explain how much fun  this video is.  You learn the Cha-cha. Merengue. Salsa. Samba. and the  Cumbia.  It's broken down into 2 segments that are 20 minute each.  I do  both because it is so much fun.  There is even a partner dancing segment at  the end.  Definately get this video!"
4,"I really like this video! No. it doesn't work you really hard. but it's an excellent alternative for days when you have less energy. I use it when I am not going for the most intense workout I can get. but still want to get my heart rate up and sweat( it's about 40 minutes). What I enjoy about it is that it's really fun to do. Everybody looks like they're having a good time. The music by the live band is great and the moves are a lot of fun. I'm sure that this one will remain a favorite of mine for a long time."
4,"This sensational DVD. culled from a TV show I have cloudy memories of from my youth. presents Andy Kaufman in a way that surpasses the Milos Forman biopic (not to denigrate Jim Carrey's outstanding performance) and the  A&amp;E Biography. You get it all here. and it's mostly hilarious. Best of  all is Mr. Kaufman's dead-on Elvis impersonation...his choice of songs is  impeccable--&quot;Too Much&quot; is an Elvis hit that Mr. Presley seldom  performed live. Great introduction (or reintroduction?) to this fascinating  character."
4,"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available. it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling 'the ladies'-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda. Bob Shapiro. etc.)Basically. if you loved 'Man on the Moon'. you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
4,"This one should be reissued in DVD. I am a grandmother and remembered how much my children. one of which is now a professional artist. loved this. I was not wrong. My three year old granddaughter requests to see it everyday over many other choices when she comes to visit. She is frightened by the wizard and cried when Sahu goes to his parents; she didn't understand why he went away. but would just come get us to sit with her for that part. She is still requesting it a year later. I have memorized the songs. As with so many others brought to you by Sesame Street it is treasure for all ages."
4,"Because it certainly desrves it. Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney. this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift. but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl. and keep hoping that it will be released.One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace. Whatever your chronological age. you will find this program timeless in it's appeal and beloved by all.That is what indicates real staying power. not how many toys one can invent. market and make profit from."
4,"As a kid. I used to watch Sesame Street. a show that was by then a classic. My parents bought this film from the library and my sister and I watched it constantly. My dad still remembers songs from the film and my sister and I reminisce about it.The plot of the story is that the kids and the puppets get locked into a museum overnight. They get to tour the area without being bothered by others. Oscar the Grouch sings a song about wonderful trash. referring to the broken statues all around him. Cookie Monster sings the title song when he gets hungry from looking at still life paintings all night. Big Bird and Snuffy find an Egyptian Prince and attempt to help him become a star in the sky like his parents. Everything that happens is entertaining and educational.Not only does this film address a side of schooling that isn't always addressed in schools. art. it is a great way for parents to spend time with their children and help them to grow."
4,"Elmo does it again -- steals the show as a dusty but lovable little monster 'Cinderelmo' who toils with housework while his evil step mom and step brothers get ready for the Princess Birthday Ball.  The music is infectious. the characters all play memorable parts. the guest actors are WONDERFUL in their roles as Fairy Godfather (Oliver Platt). The Evil StepMom (Kathy Najimy) and Princess (Keri Russell).  I play this movie several times per week for our two year old because she just adores watching the scenery and singing along with all the catchy and original songs.  This is a must have for any Elmo Fan!"
4,"My daughter. who just turned 1. has been an Elmo fan for a little while now. This is the only thing with Elmo that she doesn't like. She wouldn't watch more than 5 minutes of it. It's much different from other of his videos. It's more scripted and less animated than his normal segments. I think it would be more popular with 2 or 3 year olds. especially if they're familiar with Cinderella. I loved it and am saving it. I'm sure my daughter will warm to it in the upcoming months."
4,"this is from the series of books that spawned the wizard of oz film.in this one.the lion must find the ultimate icon of good or something to that effect.i belive its a flower.dorothy is along for the ride too.the witch has a evil icon that spreads evil to everything it touches.only the flower can stop the witch.the kids like it some.its a fantasy/adventure type deal.the wizard of oz movie was far better than this cartoon.ive never read the book but i think it would be quite excellent.id love to see the other books turned into films also."
4,"I taped it off of Toon Disney. I'd never heard of this movie before. but me being the Oz fan that I am. I thought I should check it out. Overall. it was a pretty good movie. I like how they developed the friedships between Wimsik and Lion and Caroline and Captain Fitzgerald. Silly is an interesting character but he lightens the movie up a bit. There are some beautiful songs even if Wimsik's voice was digitally worked to make her sound better. They depicted very well the hatred the Wicked Witch of the East had for her sister. It also has a bit of a mystery to it which was very creative. The animation was very nice. It's worth the watch! Check it out!"
4,"This is the best purchase anyone can make if you want to shred being that finding a good teacher that can teach this skill is not easy. Paul besides being an incredible player covers all bases of Alternate Picking and String Skipping like he was in front of you. This is worth every singe penny. Now you have both instructionals on one DVD for the price of one!!!!I own a vast array of instructionals. and if you only had 17 dollars to spend on a dvd. this is the best money you'll ever spent. Paul teaches shred like he was in front of you and believe me. no one posseses that skill. I also recommend his other instructionals after you are ready to move forward from this one Terryfying Guitar Trip. Get Out Of My Yard and his latest. Silence Followed By a Deafening Roar.RATING 10"
4,"Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things don't necessarily go together.  His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping.  I really don't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument.  Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion. and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works.  I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I've purchased over the last thirty years. and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three.  If you are at all interested in shred guitar. you simply have to buy this.  Many of us paid $40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos (parts I and II). so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price.  Thanks. Paul!"
4,"I'm brand new to the Andy Kaufman band wagon.  Hoping to spend as little money as possible while purusing a local video store. I happened upon this one.  All it is. is a narrator with an incredibly boring. insomnia-healing voice give a 35 minute account of Andy's life.  While there are several hilarious clips featuring Kaufman. his voice is nearly always drowned out by the super-boring narrator.  Considering the pranks and antics of this unpredictable showman (who did not like to be referred to as a comedian). he probably would have laughed his head off at the people who actually bought this video.  This video ranks right up there with Andy trying to get ABC to purposefully screw up the reception for his Special.  Please. especially if (like me) you're a newcomer. stay away from this one.  Go with the &quot;Midnight Special&quot; instead.  It's great Kaufman humor and also very clean humor (something you just don't find nowadays)."
4,"Maybe this is all part of THE JOKE; to get people caught up in the reemergence of Kaufman fame and then to purchase a totally CRUMMY product. HAHAHAHA! I bet Bob Zmuda (Andy's best friend) was a behind this. HAHAHAHA!  Just reading the reviews got me to laugh. Part of Andy's act was bombing on  purpose. Go back and watch this again or compare the part in the movie when  Kaufman wanted the ABC special to look as if it was messing up. (MAN are  some people gullible...)"
4,"I had seen the author make presentations on television before and thought this would be a great video to own. Had I seen parts of it prior to purchase I would not have bought it. Most of the video is him talking to TBN hosts. It would have been a better video witout the connection of TBN hosts. He should have talked to the audience (or camera) and not to the two people sitting there with him.The presentation was subdued and I have to say boring. Great information was provided but you had to force yourself to stay awake to hear it.I was also disappointed that the segnments all started with the same introduction. It was like it was an addition to add more time to the length of the video so you could advertise it as a longer length.Very disappointed.For anyone else I recommend you skip the movie and buy the book."
4,"I enjoyed the message David tries to portray and have respect for what he is trying to tell us. I am disappointed in his presentation.  Our family home schools our children and we were hoping to be able to use the series to educate our children about the christian message.  The American Heritage Series is basically just a long lecture. Its an unpolished narrated lecture that makes history boring like they do in many classrooms.  David is like the expert professor who puts his class to sleep because of presentation. I rate him 3 stars. Actually an average of 5 stars for content and 1 star for presentation."
4,"I learned a lot about our nation's history that simply isn't taught in our classrooms anymore.  David Barton lays out the facts.  This is the History of our nation in the words of the men who made the history.  The recent textbook battle in Texas was largely over this issue: getting the real history of our nation back into the history books.  I can understand why people with a certain political agenda wouldn't want this information out there. but if you want the whole truth and not the current edited version of history that is being taught in so many of our classrooms today. this is for you."
4,"The informational content is superb but it is presented in a combination of psudeo talk show and lecture format. In addition. Mr. Barton speaks very fast and dispenses a large volume of information in a short amount of time. The result is that the episodes tend to be dry and boring. Adding to these difficulties is the fact the DVDs include the promotions for the series from when it aired on TV. As a result the episodes are interupted approximately every 8 minutes with what amounts to a commercial for the series. This gets exceptionally tiring after a short period of time. While I would wish that every high school student in the nation along and every adult citizen study this series. I think that anyone who is not seriously interested in the subject matter will find watching it to be a tedious affair."
4,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement 'Separation of Church and State' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long. and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
4,"I loved history in grade school. junior high into high school though my junior year a teacher ruined it for me with her non-teaching ways with popping in a video and leaving a worksheet before leaving the room for the period. Evolution is what was preached and shoved down our throats. History became boring and choking with it's evolution and anti-America BS. bringing me to pull out of the rest of my history classes and having a distaste for (public) education. Now that I am enrolled in University my love for learning and history is coming back. American Heritage Series has brought my love of history back! Love that He encourages you to read the original documents and research for yourself. Thank you Mr. Barton and God bless you."
4,"David Barton. as a first-class researcher. has furnished the indisputable historical proof of the godly heritage in the founding of America. Watch and learn as you explore the fascinating details. events. and personalities of US history. Great care is given to the unfolding drama of our nation's godly tradition as the DVD set covers a massive amount of captivating amazing-but-true stories.Some of the topics covered are how faith influenced American:- Education- Religious freedoms- Civil and judicial domains- Cultural and societal arenas- Separation of Church and State- And much moreOver twenty episodes that will thrill you and your whole family. Great for church Bible study or home school."
4,"David Barton's a treasure.  Thankfully. he's taken it upon himself to preserve the Great documents of our forefather. that went into making America great.  There's been so much effort to play down and revise our history and make it conform to the lax standards of today. that whole generations haven't had access to the authentic original wording. penned by our founding fathers.  I'm so glad Mr Barton had the fore-thought to preserve our history. for us and future generations.  Now. we all have no excuses. not to 'pass it on'.  And...he does it in a very interesting. riveting way.  He has a site: [...] where a lot of great info can be accessed. also..and a Facebook page.  We need to patronize him. so he can keep up the good work!"
4,"I first started reading the Mandie books when I was twelve.  Needless to say. I'm more than twice that age now.  So it was quite a delight for me when I stumbled across this movie at Blockbuster.  I had no idea they were making Mandie movies. I'm so glad to see it!  I thought this movie did a fairly accurate portrayal of Mandie and her kin.  I really enjoyed the Cherokee personalities.  And I thought Dean Jones as Jason Bond was especially good.  Uncle John was well portrayed by a dapper young gentleman.  And in essence. the movie was darling and very likeable.  The single and only reason I don't rate it a five star movie is because I thought the almost comedic style of acting in the movie detracted from what could have been a very serious and successful story line.  Other than that. I really enjoyed this movie."
4,"The overall impression of this movie is of a very nice movie for children; almost everything about this movie is suitably designed for young children. I have not read the books and watched this one on a hunch. The movie was sufficiently interesting to keep me watching all the way to the end but I would expect many members of the younger audience. pre-teen for example. to enjoy the movie much more.Of the actors only one was familiar and that was Dean Jones and he was also one of the few that didn't specifically look like they were acting.The scenery was beautiful and had some very lovely settings in the woods of North Carolina. The overall ambience of the movie was appropriate for a young audience as well. This is a good solid move for children and I recommend it as such."
4,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's cute. fun. enjoyable. and clean--and also inspiring and moral.Frankly. after reading some of the reviews of the film. I was expecting a movie with awful acting and amateurish production.  I saw neither.  Oh. the acting isn't Academy-Award quality. but it's not that bad either.  Similarly. the production quality isn't at the level of a George Lucas film. but it's not what I'd call amateurish by any stretch.  Overall. I thought the acting and the production quality were both pretty good. certainly good enough to make the movie entertaining.This is really a charming. fun movie that the whole family will enjoy.  I give it five stars because I love the movie. in spite of its very minor flaws."
4,"Much more than a typical family film. this is the highest quality 'independent' or 'small studio' film I have ever seen.  An excellent blend of history. drama. mystery and a touch of humor.The producers used Imagery and Lighting brilliantly. whenever they focused on Mandie during the flashback scenes when the 'Indian Story' was being told.An absolutely outstanding performance was given by Lexi Johnson [who played Mandie. both in this movie and in the first sequel].  Her prior acting experience [all five movies of the Sugar Creek series] can be seen in the attention to detail and nuanced expressions she brought to this role.  The entire cast and production also deserve much credit.I totally agree with a previous reviewer who commented 'the movie was magical!'"
4,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL. LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON. SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE. SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA. AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE."
4,"Discerning viewers. not distracted by production values not on par with multimillion  dollar Hollywood productions. will find in this film a message fitting for our times. This film is about a young family enjoying the American Dream until it goes bust; however instead of finger pointing at political figures. or scrambling for help from government or extended family. this family discovers there is sound reason a certain historical figure from Nazareth is called Saviour. Mighty Counselor and the Prince of Peace - peace for the soul. This film poses the question. As America descends into the abyss. what can you place your trust in - promises of politicians. the life savings and benevolence of friends and family. or the living Lord?"
4,"I loved this movie. it would be a GREAT movie to show to a Youth group at church as I believe this movie teaches not only about Hosea. but it has a GREAT message about acceptance and how we all are going through things at one time or another and how we should not judge others because of their seemingly standoffishness.... (if this is a word).... I was shy as a young teen. and was going through things at home.... had no friends and I could relate to this girl..... thank you Beverly Patton"
4,"This movie is a well made well acted movie about God's amazing love. This movie is a must see for youth groups! I know from when I was in youth group that there are a lot of cliques in youth group and church. but church is not an exclusive club for those who fit a certain mold. This movie shows that we need to live out Christ's love and gives very practical ways. The movie flashes back to the story of Hosea and Gomer and really explains how much God loves us. I would highly recommend this movie!"
4,"The director used an interesting approach - showing an expanded story of Hosea and Gomer. which is not supported or denied by scripture. as a story being told by a youth group leader trying to demonstrate unconditional love toward a young lady who is struggling to fit in anywhere. especially at a campground with a bunch of church kids. At times the switchbacks are reminiscent of The Princess Bride as the youth group members interrupt the story being related to them to offer personal opinions about the unfaithful wife and her doting husband. The Hosea part of the filming was awesome - the youth group part not so much. but still commendable. This is definitely a film that should be shown in all youth groups. I'd highly recommend that Christian parents of teens add this one to their personal film library."
4,"This is a really great Movie For almost anyone to SEE! It kept My attention the whole Time! They did a great job flipping back & Forth from The trials  Hosea faced during His Time (  Straight Bible ) & the teenagers & really all of Us as We met New People And realize We are ALL different .We all have different backgrounds .We need to remember Instead of ' Pasting Judgement ASAP' Practice  The Golden Rule! LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES We might find We are going to find new friends & nice People!"
4,"Richard Boone is both narrator and participant in some of these episodes.  The historical background given by Boone in the opening scenes is brief and to the point so that you can be taken to the scene of the action quickly and efficiently.This series is a fine snapshot of medical practices of the 1950s which might seem outmoded now.  Electro-convulsive therapy is shown as a treatment practice in the '50s.  The effects of a nuclear bomb explosion are graphic and chilling to watch and listen to.  The open heart valve replacement is quite intriguing even in black and white.  Overall this is a series that while it might seem to be somewhat dated is good for historical background and comparison with the way medicine is practiced now.Growing up in the 1950s this was the state of medicine as I knew it and it seemed pretty impressive.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in medical history."
4,"I first rented this when I was about 15 &amp; my mum went apes**t. A movie about a guy who kills people with a blowtorch. COOOOOL! However the blowtorch isn't that big a player in the movie. This is your typical Vietnam vet revenge story ad nauseum. Vet Ginty seeks revenge on the creeps who ripped up his best friend with a clawhammer (Steve James- who briefly adds &quot;life&quot; to the movie). There are some hilariously bad gore scenes. including the decapitation in the opening scene which has to be seen to be believed. and how could I forget the sequence with the meat grinder? I'd advise you not to eat a hamburger while watching this movie. Worst of all though is the godawful country-western song which plays during the opening credits. Yeech!"
4,"The late Robert Ginty. R.I.P.. lays down some rough road in this one. though the guy on the cover aint him! This is a NY picture. like Street Trash. Ms. .45. The Wanderers. The Warriors. The Lords Of Flatbush. The taking Of Pelham 1.2.3. (the original 70s version with Walter Matthau. Robert Shaw. and Simon Oakland. not the unneccessary '00s remake!). et al. And like all good made-in-New York movies. you know eventually somebody's gonna be handed their ass!! This is no exception. Be prepared to suffer. You have been warned! The sickness with the quickness!!"
4,"I was a huge fan of exploitation cinema back in the day. So I was a bit disappointed when I could not remember ever seeing this 'classic'. And I am even more disappointed for having seen it now. It's not going to win awards (not even Razzies) and everything screams 'tacky'. but I guess I'm just mellowing with age. Not for serious fans of realistic cinema or quality films. but certainly for people who enjoy their guilty little delights. I'm just not of those people anymore. I guess."
4,"I've had this tape for a little over a year. and I still reach for it quite often. The instructor is warm and friendly and explains how to get into each pose with percision. I always feel loose and relaxed after doing this workout. This is the tape that made me want to try even more yoga tapes to expand my practice! I recommend it to everyone I know just starting out. The price can't be beat and neither can the style. Although I have aquired more tapes recently. this tape will stay in my yoga practice for a long time to come!"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
4,"This movie does have entertainment value. and it is affordable enough to entertain some friends at home on a rainy day.  The video is grainy. almost 16mm like in appearance.  The music and sound effects during the fights scenes reminds me of the 60's campy hooded crimefighter shows. ZAP!  BOOM!  POW!  Holy Low budget Cinema! is what Jack Nicholsons trusty sidekick would say if he had one.  There is a story and it is ok.  Buy it for your collection. otherwise pass."
4,"I've seen this one three or four times on Speedvision. Kind of ruthless toward the women but conveys the style of the Hell's Angels. Too bad about Adam Roarke. He was a good guy. a pretty good actor. stunt man and.... well he died a little before his time. I could call myself a biker but my Kawasaki Z1R although quick doesn't quite fit the image of a Harley Davidson. Some how Jack Nicholson just doesn't fit in either. Sonny &quot;Ralph&quot; Barger sure does!"
4,"This one totally bites.  Unless you were born in the 40's this one is completely out of date.  No bite no bang and way too much buck.  The music is so annoying my girlfriend had to leave the room.  Hippy dippy elevator music with big bad bikers.  Everyone in this movie is an idiot and none of the chicks are hot.  If you are into biker flicks check out Hell Ride.  That's a biker flick.  This is yet another example of how phony the 60's were.  Save your money.  I wish I had."
4,"If you like biker movies with realism this is it ! Real Hell's Angels and their bikes from the mid 60's . Great acting ! This is one of Jack Nicholson's early movies and Adam Roarke does a great job as the leader . It is a good story about a loner who it tired of playing the 'straight game' and quits his job at a gas station . Later that night he runs into the Hells Angels at a bar and ends up prospecting for the club. The original bobbers are so cool as they are the real machines of the day . Great fight scenes . great riding scenes . a 60's love in party and a cameo apearence in the beginning of the film by Sonny Barger himself really puts the touch to the film ! I would give this one a 10 !"
4,"Kudos to RareFlixNClassic for reliable and expedeiant service. ordered (03 March 2010) same time as other products. I recieved this one 9 March 2010 and as of 10 March 2010 Amazon still has not shipped the other iteams oreder with this one. All with the super saver shipping including this one. Quick shipping. Recieved product as advetised in new condition. The movie it self is a classic anti culture movie ot its time. I like the movie for what it is and you get to see Nickolsen from his earlyer years in the buissness."
4,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan. Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah. the Three-Headed Monster. this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If. though. you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most  horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall. Tokyo is not threatened. no buildings are crushed. no tin tanks are destroyed. no thousands of people flee in terror. there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
4,"This was one of the first Godzilla movies I saw as a kid and to this this day it's my number one favorite Godzilla movie. Plenty of monsters in this flick you get the return of Rodan.plus you get to watch Godzilla and Rodan go at it and then you get to watch Godzilla;Rodan. and Mothra team up and fight King Ghidorah the baddest of the villians in the Godzilla series. The story line was really good in this Godzilla flick as well it had a James Bond twist for human drama in this film which kept it interesting. The monsters got plenty of screen time on this flick which made it even better and this is one of the few Godzilla films that don't involve space ailens controlling the monsters as well. In this one you actually get to see the monsters be monsters. The special effects in this film were good especially when Ghidorah starts destroying the city and the monster battles were awesome in this one as well. I would definetly recommend this one to any Godzilla fan out there."
4,"I have been waiting for this for what seems like ever. and I have not been disapointed.  This was one of the few films that I have watched through the whole of my life and never been tired of.  Whether it was the English or Japanese version I loved it.  Everything about it was awesome and even if the DVD didn't have special features I would have purchased it the moment it touched the shelf.If you are a fan of science fiction. kaiju. or just monsters in general then do yourself a favor and pick this film up turn the lights down low (where applicable) and get ready to be amazed by the cheezy monstery goodness that came to you from a long long time ago from a far away land across the sea.A simple plot with enough mystery to keep you plugged in and enough human drama to make you car abou the characters and enough monsters  and sci fi to keep you happy.  Just watch it and see for yourself."
4,"Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster or Godzilla # 5 as some may file it is a good entry in the long running series. I've never been a huge fan of Ghidorah in part because it seems to be more puppet than man in a suit monster so he has a lot less emotion than most of the other giant monsters from Japan. This is probably intentional as he is a mindless giant creature of destruction.This one is a bit talky for me. but we do get the first real monster team up here with Godzilla. Rodan and Mothra doing battle with the title monster. Lots of fun in this one once it gets rolling and this DVD edition from Classic Media does include both U.S. and Japanese versions of the film. This and many other Godzilla/ToHo titles are at bargain prices. so if you're wanting to add them to your collection. these are very nice editions."
4,"this movie was very entertaining and right to the point. you don't have to wait that long to start seeing the monsters and the human acting is very well done. the only problem is that the trailer is in japanese but the movie ended up being an english dub. i would much rather have watched it in it's original form with subtitles. which i feel would have been more authentic.  however. it was still good and the dialogue still came across pretty well. if you enjoyed mothra i would say to check this out. it was definitely enjoyable."
4,"This was one of my favorite in the series growing up. and remains one of the most significant overall in it being the first time Godzilla and Rodan appeared together. was the introduction of Ghidorah. still the best villain in the series. and (to my knowledge at least) was the first time an all out rumble between more than two monsters occurred.About the only bad thing I could really say about it is the manic nature of the fights does take away from the illusion of size. but that is a small complaint as that was one of the trademarks of the first generation of films in this series.This one is great fun all around."
4,"Usually the first movie is the best one. and here it is true.  Ghidorah was always my favorie film in the Godzilla series.  We have some great monster battles. well detailed sets for destroying. and get to see Ghidorah with the meanness he's meant to have. only otherwise seen in Destroy all Monsters.  Both versions are very clean both visually and in audio.  The dubbed version is probably the one we all grew up seeing... with a lot of the added in music which. I feel. adds greatly to the film.  This is the copy all Godzilla fans ought to pick up."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
4,"I am a big godzilla fan and I saw this movie as a kid. It's about a huge. three headed monster coming to destroy earth. And it's up to baby Mothra to convince godzilla and rodan to stop fighting each other and join mothra to defeat the 3 headed monster that the earth phrophecies said would arrive to destroy the earth. I liked this movie!  It's a lot of fun to see Godzilla.rodan and mothra baby  team up to defeat it. If you are a godzilla or monster movie fan give this movie a try.much recommended!"
4,"This is a great Godzilla movie. but there's just one scene in it that just prevents it from being a total success. The lead up to the climactic battle between the space monster Ghidrah and the defenders of Earth. Godzilla.  Rodan and Mothra is entertaining and fun. But then we have the scene in  which the three Earth monsters &quot;talk&quot; to each other when Mothra  tries to convince the other two to help he/she/it fight Ghidrah. There  could have been another way to do this scene. Even the post chat fight  scene between all the monsters is great. Re-work that scene and you've got  a film that is almost on par with the original &quot;Godzilla: King of the  Monsters&quot;"
4,"The Showa series is probably best known for it's cheesy entries. and this might be where it all began.  However. this does not mean it's some piece of trash. it's actually a decent Godzilla movie.  The story is pretty good. the monster fights are entertaining. it's an overall fun movie to watch.  To be honest. the only cheesy moments are when the monsters are on screen - if I'm not mistaken. this is the first Godzilla film to give the monsters human characteristics such as laughing. talking. silly hand gestures. etc. - but nonetheless. it's all good fun.  One of my favorites. and definitely worth adding to your collection."
4,"The original Japanese theatrical release is in pristine condition however Classic Media/Toho studios should have also cleaned up and remastered the American English dubbed version. That was annoying as one who would prefer to watch the American version and not have to concentrate on reading subtitles is distracted by the the uncleaned film print presented.The dvd also offers a couple of extra features which consist of stills of the monsters that star in the film and a biography(forgotten who).Stills include text and other film appearances of the monsters-with title and year given."
4,"Ghidorah (also known as 'Ghidrah' in the U.S. edit of the film) is a merciless three-headed dragon from outer space with the abilities to shoot lethal electric bolts from its mouths. and it will have to take the combined might of Rodan. Mothra. and Godzilla to defeat it! A very enjoyable movie. It starts out a bit slow. but once the film starts to get going. it has possibly some of the best and most exciting action scenes out of any Godzilla movie. With a really good story. four monsters. one of them Ghidorah - my favorite Godzilla villain. it's hard not to like this one. This film also features Godzilla's transition from bad guy to good guy and the last one in a long while to be taken mostly seriously. A great movie that would be a shame to miss out on.Highly Recommended!"
4,"One of my child hood favorite G-films released on a DVD of incredible quality. This DVD has even more special features than 'Mothra vs. Godzilla'. with an image gallery included. This time David Kalat was the `G-expert' selected for the commentary. I think he delivers an entertaining performance as he mainly focuses on the evolution of Godzilla from a serious villain to a campy and comical hero. He tells us his opinion on the matter and how it really affected the original series. The image gallery has some nice photos with captions and in the end another great classic media release."
4,"If you're a fan of Toho films then you have probably seen this talky monster film. While this release has a nice DVD transfer and print the film itself is slow moving with little monster action until the last 15 minutes. I remember Godzilla films fondly from my childhood. but this has never been one of my favorites. Sure it's got lots a monsters(Godzilla. Rodan. Mothra and Ghidorah). but they have very little screen time.The good news is this release has both the U.S. and Japanese version of the film with the Japanese version running about 6 minutes longer. There is a cool posters and stills gallery and a 7 minute documentary on FX master Eiji Tsuburaya. It's not the best in the series. but Godzilla fans should dig this release for sure!I posted this film release under The Invasion Of The Astro Monster by mistake and I will correct that review a.s.a.p. Ooop! ;-b"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
4,"It took a month for me to actually receive this film. I have been waiting for years to see this. the last Godzilla film I needed for my collection. I should have waited longer. Even if you don't mind that this is a cheap DVD-R bootleg of a shoddy print. or that the title is spelled wrong. or that the cover and label are ugly as sin... you should not buy it. Why? Because the last chapter of the disc doesn't play! You can't even watch the whole film all the way through. I have returned and replaced this disc twice already and they were all the same. I'm going to avoid all DVDs from &quot;Cine Vu&quot; from now on."
4,"I'm another one of those people who used to see daikaiju movies on Saturday matinee TV as a child. Close as I came to a couch potato and it made me really interested in Japan. I've been waiting so long to find these films given a proper digital conversion. The last few years have made me very excited (for an adult) as Toho has finally pulled the cork out of its uptight behind 15+ years into the digital revolution and allowed the west to see the Japanese-language widescreen versions of most of the Godzilla oeuvre without spending $$$ on an import.As usual. on Ghidorah. Classic Media has added some interesting short extras. I feel lucky. at this point. to even get to see the theatrical release. so my bias is very pro. but the price really is a no-brainer. isn't it?"
4,"This is a great movie (like most Godzilla movies). 100's of mederites crash on earth. A really big one hacthes(?) and turns and King Ghidorah is born. while Rodan and Godzilla fight each other in Tokyo. Meanwhile a princess claims she's a veusin and warns Earth about nermous dangers. On time she tell Japan that King Ghidorah will attack Tokyo ! So Mothra tries to convince Godzilla and Rodan to become good and fight King Ghidorah. They disagree so Mothra will fight by herself. Wacth the movie to find out what happend next. Its not as good as the last movie Mothra VS. Godzilla. But its still a awesome movie."
4,"Being a life-long Godzilla fan. I was excited when Classic Media said they would release Ghidorah: The Three-Headed Monster on DVD! Back in 1998. we got a VHS release of the movie for the first time in YEARS. The film was pan and scan and was discolored and grainy. Not the perfect print for such a classic but we really didn't complain much because we finally got a chance to own the film.Classic Media did a great job in bringing us a widescreen version of the U.S. release and the Toho Scope Japanese version! The coloring is great. the sound is wonderful. and there is considerably much less grain than on the VHS release a handful of years earlier!There are some nice extras on this DVD including a trailer. a poster slide-show. and film commentary! This film has just enough goodies on it to keep die-hard G-Fans entertained and satisfied! Highly recommended!"
4,"Well. the title explains it. The title is extremely pointless. Why? Why? Why? Why did Toho have to make such a stupid film???! There are some changes they should have made. First. aliens. Why aliens? It is waaaay to corny. Second. Ghidrah. Way did Toho make Ghidrah look like he was a drunken elf? Ghidrah didn't have to shake his legs. heads. and wings uncontrolably! And third. MAKE GODZILLA AND THE OTHER MONSTERS GOOD GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would've given this movie five stars if Godzilla wasn't good! That mistake made the rest of the Showa series dumb. In the later movies. Godzilla acts more like Barney than a giant monster."
4,"This was one of the best programs ever to be broadcast on either public television (which is saying a great deal given other legendary programs like I'Claudius. Poldark. and Upstairs. Downstairs) or the networks. The story centers on the return of a brash young surgeon from London to his native Manchester to tend his alcoholic father. In connection with his return he joins the staff of a local hospital and shortly thereafter falls in love with an older woman he met on the trip from London. (...) Reckless offers everything a discerning viewer could want: romance. drama. comedy. suspense. and even farce. Casting is ideal all roles are admirably played by skilled actors who understand precisely who their characters are and what they should be doing/feeling at every given moment. Don't miss this one or it's equally superb follow-up: Reckless. the Sequel."
4,"Robson Green and Michael Kitchen as two-thirds of a love triangle! I so enjoyed this production for so manyreasons. It's an intelligent and witty romantic comedy. Well written. well acted. well designed. I certainly enviedFrancesca Annis being fought over by two such extraordinarily appealing leading men. I bet if anyone asked her.she would remember this film series as being one of the highlights of her acting career. I only wish that bothRobson Green and Michael Kitchen had been given more opportunities to show this side of their talent.Great fun."
4,"...but somehow I managed to do it in this boxed video series. originally shown on BBC/PBS.  Francesca Annis's same-age doctor husband takes a young woman to his medical conference and the young doctor who works for him  makes sure his wife finds out.  This is because the younger man wants his  supervisor's wife for himself.  Naturally. the wife has to get even with  her husband and after all the young man is THERE....and so we go.  It's  compelling viewing as all of their lives come blasting apart.  I've just  bought the sequel. Reckless II. so I can keep apace of even more hanky  panky."
4,"This series. first shown on Masterpiece Theatre. has everything. including romance. comedy and sex. sometimes at the same time. All of the actors are wonderful. displaying perfect comic timing. The dramatic scenes are often poignant.The love story may be central to the plot. but the adventures of Anna and Owen touch the lives of their relatives. friends and business associates in unexpected ways. The settings range from city. to lush countryside to a working man's neighborhood  and pub. to a bustling hospital. There's lots of action as well as some incredibly steamy love scenes.Reckless is a series to watch more than once. I never tire of revisiting Anna and Owen and all the other characters."
4,"From the moment I saw the preview of Reckless on A&E I wanted to see it. I enjoyed it so much I wanted to get it on DVD. I was not disappointed with my purchases. The movies are clear and the commentary at the beginning builds your anticipation if you haven't seen the movie before. I also got the Sequel and I enjoyed it also. I saw so many angles in the story-plot. and I learned something from the story the four times I've watched it; I know I will be watching it many more times. I liked the relationship between Owen and Anna. and I disliked Anna's egotistical husband who deserved what he got!"
4,"Because this is one show I watched in the 90s and never forgot. I was grateful to find it on DVD now.  And there is a bonus of episodes from a follow-up series to the original. something I missed when it was aired.  Michael Kitchen is a riot. sublime in his comedic delivery.  The romantic leads are wildly hot.  All the supporting actors are perfectly cast.  There is one actor whose accent is so thick. I barely understand what he says; however. his acting is so clear. I totally get what is going on in his scenes.  There's a brief scene with a dog....  You don't want to miss any of this program."
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
4,"RecklessOkay. I admit to being more than a little prejudiced here.  I absolutely LOVE this DVD!  Even ten years on. it has all the charm. drama and poignancy of the first showing on Masterpiece Theatre.  It's the story of young Owen Springer. a cheeky (and sexy) doctor transferred to a Manchester hospital who falls in hopelessly love with an older woman (Francesca Annis) who just happens to be his boss's wife.Steller performances by Green. Annis. Michael Kitchen. David Bradley. Julian Tutt-Rhind and Connor Mullen take this comedy/romance/satire to a new level of entertainment.  Don't miss it or the sequel. also on this 4-disc boxed set."
4,"This is a fun miniseries featuring some of my favorite British actors. Michael Kitchen(The Hanging Gale. Foyle's War). Francesca Annis (Cranford). and Robson Green (Wire in the Blood). The plot concerns a love triangle that is a bit different from the normal love triangle.  For women of a certain age-ahem-it is a delightful situation to find a younger man chasing an older married woman.  Perhaps this sounds like a soap opera but I can assure this series is so much more.  The acting. the dialog and the laugh-out-loud antics of the principals make this a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. I have loaned this set to friends and they.too. have enjoyed it.  I recommend this series highly."
4,"This was a most entertaining DVD. It was a bit long and seemed if it was a made for TV special. Actually. it was in two parts which provided a refreshing break. The subject was a body found in an underground ice house. The mystery was whodunit. The likely suspects were all involved to some degree as they were seemingly living as a lesbian threesome and scorned by the local villagers. The story unfolded with all sorts of twists and turns. new developments. and enlightening forensic evidence that was only forthcoming at critical times in the story. There was a bit of romance between the suspect and investigating detective that made for an interesting story by itself. I felt like this was a pilot movie of a series that might be scheduled to follow. There were certainly many follow up stories that could be made. I was glad that I found this DVD and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys British mysteries."
4,"Less a mystery. more a study of human nature (everyone has a hidden agenda).  In this case. the police are decidedly suspicious before the facts.  A body is found and Chief Inspector Walsh (Corin Redgrave) desperately wants it to be a man who went missing (he presumes dead) years ago.  He goes to great lengths to ensure that everyone else jumps to the same conclusion. becoming increasingly prickly when the facts decide otherwise.  Daniel Craig plays Sergeant McLoughlin. who eventually learns the inconvenient truth.There are no sympathetic characters to be found as everyone is on their worse behavior.  I found it fascinating; it certainly kept my attention throughout.  I was. however. disappointed at the resolution and would never bother watching it again because of that."
4,"Are we Jaded? Rate this product. . . We EXPECT what we purchases to BE.  To work without difficulty. without oops. without interruptions. to provide the intended use. When we receive and get the EXPECTED. we might sigh a sigh of satisfaction. More often we might not even raise an eye brow. Then we do not give of that satisfaction to the seller for providing so much to our enjoyment.This movie was checked to be in excellent condition and valued to be Worth a price and worthy of giving entertainment.This movie was packaged securely to survive the transportation from safe storage to me.This movie was sent with confidence that it would arrive into my care quickly and safely.All this required a seller that paid attention to basic details. that produced a successful transaction for both the seller and the buyer.This brings buyers back to sellers again and again.I am a happy buyer and look forward to doing business with this seller again.Clear"
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
4,"The Woman in White 2014 release. 1997 vintage. 116min. and integrating to the end.Wilkie Collins Victorian mystery.  Half-sister nieces of Limmeridge owner Mr Fairlie (Ian Richardson -Becoming Jane) unravel a conspiracy that includes a mysterious lady in white gown & veil. Fairlie hires art tutor Hartright (Andrew Lincoln -Love Actually) for the girls. Laura and Marian. Justine Waddel (Wives and Daughters) plays Laura well in her first acting role. Tara Fitzgerald (Jane Eyre '06) is Marian. Sinister encounters. crime. secrets. and nightmares prevail through the summertime of young passions. All the while the insane illusive Woman in White comes and goes. day and night. but from where no one knows. Delightful film period perfection. down to the fine English houses. and a story with a surprise twist that was unexpected to me.SDH SUBTITLES are available on the 2014 release.Also available in the DVD set:Costume Drama Collection"
4,"The film adaption of William Wilkie Collins' THE WOMAN IN WHITE was horrible only in the sense that it failed to adequately portray the written word visibly.On the hand. the film version of the story was an entertaining piece of work.  It was well-acted. especially by Tara Fitzgerald (The Tenant of Wildfell Hall). though there seems to be a lack of explanation ofr character's interest in the story. such as Count Fosco.  It is a whirlwind sort of a film. not quite romance. nor adventure.The story follows two sisters and their artist tutor through the wiles provided by a duplicious baronet from the south country of England who seeks to woo the younger sister to take her money.  Faked death. burning alive. and triumphant love bring the characters to a more mature view of the world and closer together.  Despite literary accuracy. it was a fine motion picture."
4,"I say this because I have seen the 1948 black and and white version with Alexis Smith and Eleanor Parker.and also Agnes Moorehead.and it is a very.very good film and also deserves a dvd release..why it  has'nt been released yet I do not know.And there is even a longer version of this more like a mini series that came out in the early 1980's...I have not seen that one yet...But I imagine it would cover more of the book then maybe this one....But as for this one I really enjoyed it.it was done really well..and I also think that Andrew Lincoln has a better and more meatier role here then...when he played...that pathetic character Edgar Linton..because I personally can't stand the character of Edgar Linton...{especially the way Andrew Lincoln played him}...But in this role yes I really enjoyed him and the rest of the cast very well"
4,"Woody Allen's directorial debut. and it's still funnier than many of his later movies.  You know. he tended toward introspection over comedy in later years.  At the time I ordered. this import was the only widescreen version (zone 0) available in north america.  Sure. it has some korean styled packaging. but you still get english audio and subtitles.  The movie itself is is fresh comedy from a guy making a funny movie. not a commercial movie.  Beware. this movie contains prison scenes and carved soap."
4,"This is an early film (his first) of comedian /actor/director Woody Allen starring himself in the lead as Virgil Starkwell a bungling wannabe bank robber whose hijinks land him in prisons. in bed with a lovely girl and the halls of academia as an expert on crime. In this film we can see the outlines of Woody's seemingly endless love affair with early black and white crime and film noir classics. There is a little more use of sight gags here than in latter films but through it all Woody is still the funny bumbling New York Jewish kid that a long series of films will explore in greater detail. The use of an old time newsreel announcer to describe and set the framework of the film and detail the action is an interesting twist. Not the best Woody Allen film but a good look at the niche that he created for himself in American urban comedy/ social commentary cinema."
4,"This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product. I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.Further. ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio. but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed. it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola. I wouldn't have bought this doorstop. and humbly suggest that you don't either. Go with the1992 FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENTversion instead."
4,"This is one of those movies that Woody has his fans refer to in 'Stardust Memories'. and vicariously in 'Husbands and Wives'. as being early funny work--and funny it is as you'll laugh your way through nearly all of it.  Parts of 'Take the Money and Run' are as hysterical as 'Sleeper.' such as the shot where his gun turns to soap suds and when he morphs into a Rabbi.  Also of note is when he poses as a classical musician but can't place the name of Mozart.  This is happy. loose camp in the spirit of the Marx Brothers.  Rent it. buy it. do whatever. you can't go wrong with this one.  It's good clean fun."
4,"I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below. you MUST see the others: Love and Death. Bananas. Take the Money and Run. Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask. Anie Hall. Sleeper. A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !"
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
4,"This movie will make you laugh til you cry. it really is hilarious from beginning to end. Woody Allen is at his best in this film that he also directed.I'm giving it 4 stars as I did not like Janet Margolin as his girlfriend in this movie. thought a better choice could have been made to play this role. She seemed to be reading the lines throughout. not breathing any life into the role.Other than that. loved everything about this film. A great pick me up if you've had a bad day and need some big laughs. This one is a keeper!"
4,"This is a great Woody Allen film.However. it is only 85 minutes long. just like every other release.The description claims uncut 91 minute version. There is no extra material.It is widescreen. but I have to compare it side-by-side with a VHS version to acertain if making it widescreen cuts off the bottom and top of the picture.All special features are only written text and only in Korean. so virtually no special features unless you read Korean.Don't buy this because the description claims uncut version.It is not.It is. however. a really funny Woody film! Buy any domestic release."
4,"Presented as a mock documentary complete with narration by radio ham Jackson Beck. Allen's hilarious directorial debut is nuttier and loaded with more gags than his later. more sophisticated New York films. But that's exactly why it works: The laughs are goofy and often puerile. and for all the zippy one-liners that don't quite elicit a full-belly guffaw. Allen piles on with cutting satire (focused mostly on footage of presidents Nixon and Eisenhower). You'll have a lot of fun watching this manic genius at work in one of his earlier comedic efforts."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
5,"The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived. so it was even better than I had expected.As an added bonus. one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy. so for reminiscent's sake. I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording. :DIf you needed a pop filter. this will work just as well as the expensive ones. and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product! :]"
5,"I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins."
5,"I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano. which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion. a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals."
5,"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber. but other than that. the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that."
5,"Hosa cable quality can be all over the place. some of their products are good (sound good. reliable. long lasting) and some of their products are not good (affect sound negatively. break prematurely. short useful life span).These guitar cords are actually quite nice. they feel good (gooey soft rubber jacket like Mogami). they sound good and so far they are working reliably. the rubber jacket is about .25&#34; in diameter (by eye) and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug.I bought these when I needed cables fast for an internet concert. we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up. These cables arrived in good working condition and we've been using them continuously since.We have over a dozen tube amps and are very particular about sound degradation but so far these cables have not disappointed anyone.I would buy more if I needed them."
5,"I never really considered a cheaper cable. I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon. I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise. this is an excellent cable. with good build quality and a strong. thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables. and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm. guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over. try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!"
5,"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it. a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable. there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft"
5,"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones. where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire."
5,"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First. it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be 'gentle' with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second. the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable. heavy duty. and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!"
5,"On my mixer. I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip. return on the ring. and a common ground.  But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4' TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch. Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return."
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
5,"This is what it is... A super cheap mono cable. It should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven. Just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded. etc.For the price and intent. I almost gave it 5 stars. But it's not a 5-star cable... It's a fair quality ultra cheap cable. 4 stars seems about right. (Yes. this is almost exactly what I wrote about the other Hosa cable I reviewed.)"
5,"These little patch cables work nicely. there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..I'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. The product description says 6 inches. right? If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches. right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches. whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up.To conclude. would I recommend these? Yes. if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable. go for these. But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else."
5,"I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake. to change 1 channel into my monitor return. I plug an XLR to Female 1/4' stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. Now I can record with 6 channels. and monitor with 2. (It's an 8 channel XLR snake). Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake. and instead of buying another snake. why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter... :-P I love it. It's a great tool to add versatility to your setup. no matter what you're doing. Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4' stereo... It's high quality. and very solid. I definately expect this to last me a long time."
5,"I bought this XLR splitter to split the lead vocal from FOH to my monitor rack.  Used this way it worked great and I never had any problems with signal loss or power issues.  I began using a transformer isolated XLR splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter.  My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short. so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singer's microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground. or horizontally placed. but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand."
5,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it. plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack. Best Buys no where else. I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself. but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way. I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards.ffsalsa"
5,"This Dual splitter works perfect. I own a live event video company and I shoot a lot of weddings. The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say. half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though. the signal is to hot. the music is crap. or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time. This product has improved my productions beyond it's price sold. I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJ's wireless systems to my own audio recorder. They work perfectly and haven't failed me once."
5,"This was recommended to me by the top engineer at Genz-Benz bass amplification company.  Andy said that this product is far superior to any other.  He was right.  Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6.0 amp.  Also fixed the effects loop jacks. which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs.  Not good!  After several gigs worth of testing. both problems are resolved!  Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating. cleaning and coating effect on the components.  Wow!  And no. Andy does not own stock in. have affiliation with. or represent in any way the manufacturers of De-Oxit.  Nor do I."
5,"Back in the 1980's I bought a can of deoxit(not the right name but can't remember it) which worked much better and cost much less. It was made for the military. The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high. It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better. I don't see much else out there so I may have to stick with it.It is just very wasteful for the cost. I have had good luck with wd40 too. but it is very flammable. I would call it average."
5,"I deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars. basses. amps. FX. MIDI gear. etc.  Over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy / noisy pots (knobs). input and output jacks that are crackly. etc.In the past I've tried some Locktite electronics cleaner. which is provided in a similar can. It would rarely work.In contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear I've used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks. It's really like magic in a can."
5,"I bought this cable for my band's live show setup.  I bought it almost a year ago and still currently use it for the same application.  While not the best quality cable. the length and price make it a good value for the money. especially if you're buying several at a time.  I don't use these cables in the studio but for live. they're fine.  I'd recommend this cable if you're on a budget and looking to buy several at a time.  If you're only going to buy one. I'd look into Canare or Mogami. they're a little bit more expensive but easy to get and worth the price."
5,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables. and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g.. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell. and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them. and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies. so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
5,"I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900. It's a big step up from that one. I am pleased with it. The old one had a lot of handling noise. This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it. My next one will be an SM58. but that will be awhile from now. I'm very happy with this PG58.Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree."
5,"Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard. which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound. drums. congas. tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech. the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
5,"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't. it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic. I use it for instruments. vocals. even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals. but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned. and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably. then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon. but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics. you can't go wrong here."
5,"Great all around mic used for vocals.  No frills. tough as nails. and great sound for live music.  If you're buying your first mic (or switching from a cheapie) and intend to use it for singing/vocals. this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation.  I've never used another one since the first time I switched from a cheaper mic (that came with some bundle) 10 years ago.  I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly.  You can stand 3 feet away and really wail. or get up close for some bass response. or anything in between.The SM58-CN comes with the mic. 25-ft cable. cable tie. carry pouch. and mic clip.  The standard SM58 does not have a switch (one less thing to break and I don't miss it)  but the SM58-S does have it for a few dollars extra."
5,"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires. of course. the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them. I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience."
5,"I have one of these. as well as several other microphones. The SM58 is a good all around mic - the reason it's an industry standard/go-to. but the Beta 58A is a better (in my opinion) vocal-specific mic...basically giving (again. in my opinion) a higher quality sound. The SM58 by comparison sounds muffled/muddy. where the Beta58A is clearer. stronger. and more articulate. If you're used to the SM58. then the Beta58A can sound thin and harsh. but. that is adjustable at the board - end result is that it's a tighter sounding mic with more clarity.Pattern-wise. it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds - I play drums and use this mic for that reason. is that it picks up less of my drums than a SM57 or a SM58."
5,"I'm an amateur sound tech. We've been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we've had before. Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews. When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah.. For me. it sounded better than SM58. My songleaders have tested it and guess what... they dont want to use the SM58 anymore :)"
5,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Dano stomp boxes.  I probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make.  This pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs. but IMHO the tremolo from Dano's Cool Cat line is a much more durable pedal for only $4 more (at the time of this review).  The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link.  I don't think it's true bypass either.  The Cool Cat has a metal enclosure. true bypass. sturdier inputs and knobs. and a much better on/off switch.  The features and sound are the same.  Spend the extra $4 and you will have a much more bullet-proof pedal with the Cool Cat trem."
5,"Hey. it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several 'cheapo' pedals. and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic). at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound. not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough. it doesn't take up much space. it sounds great. and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND. if you are like the typical musician. you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
5,"I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one.  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine.  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!"
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
5,"I've played guitar for 5 years. Seen many different capos. but none that quite satisfies me as the Kyser.You really can't go wrong with this capo. It is very mobile. easily adjustable. sturdy. and durable.What's good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 String capo and still turn it around to use it asa Cut capo. The transparent rubber piece does the same job.It comes in different colors also.I own the black. silver. gold. and camo Kyser capos.I also own the Cut Capo for other styles.I recommend it!All the capos I've had from Kyser are still in great conditions.Use them all the time at church and at home"
5,"I don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo. but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos.  important to take it off when not in use so the 'rubber' does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another."
5,"Long time Shubb user. but decided to try something different.I think I've found how lazy I am. I ended up using the Kyser more often than the Shubb because of the fact that you can put the Kyser on the peghead.Reaching my hand to an always available position on guitars (i.e. the peghead) for the Kyser turns out to be much more convenient than reaching to something that is not on the guitar and that could change according to situations. e.g. maybe just by my side on the sofa in my living room. maybe a table or the floor in some other places. for the Shubb."
5,"I have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. The price is right for these. and they work just fine. My only real issue is that sometimes. they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you're going to bar. thus producing a sound you weren't looking for. Some of the higher end capo's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. However. like i say. these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard. and are from what i can tell. the most popular model on the market."
5,"I really like my capo. the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic. and it works as it should. However. I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product. For example. I think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer. and rounded (the back side of a guitar neck is rounded. after all). The spring could definitely be tighter...I do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough. Also. the design is fairly nice. but it's mostly aesthetic...it's not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily.Don't get me wrong. this is a rather good product. and it's priced about right. It just isn't a high end product/5-star perfect."
5,"This is my third pack; the 1st pack has been using for two months. the sounds are rich and full. and the feels are still good.  I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing. and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time.  So. I want to keep a completed pack for back up.  I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently. sometime. i will practice for 4-5 hours+ until i'm tired for the session.  I have used light steel strings on my acoustic. but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter."
5,"I am yet another one of those 'Forever Beginners' when it comes to playing the guitar. Never mind that...these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better! After putting in new pegs and re-stringing with these strings...it sounds so much nicer! More richer! Now I see I need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose. I think that once I do this and then re-string these same strings on it...I will be set to go!I like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of years...let's face it...my fingers get sore when playing! I also have small fingers and hands.I intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use.I recommend!"
5,"I bought this pick holder because I hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you can't play with a pick in your strings. I originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock. Boy was I wrong. The picture is misleading.  This thing is tiny and barely goes across three string. It wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks (maybe more if they are thin) into the wedges on top. Stays in place well and is very convenient.Only negative is I don't know how long it will hold up. I think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better. I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks."
5,"Not too much to say. it's made out of foam. made to slip between the strings. made to hold two picks.  I have several of these. for acoustics and for electrics.  My son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won't be dislodged. still. it does stay on majority of the time.  I do recommend this.  My son's guitar teacher calls this a 'fancy little pick holder' and I've had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time.  One must also be careful. my son lost one of these so I know it is a possibility of it falling off.  He lost it after performing in a play on stage.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
5,"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar. as I often find myself playing with fingers. then suddenly a 'pick song' starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it. and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick. but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it. but the 'spreading strings' on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So. still highly recommended if your headstock has a 'straight through' design. not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )"
5,"I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick. Worked. but it was difficult getting all three picks in one Wedgie so I ordered a second one. Between the two of them. between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut. works pretty good holding these types of picks (which admittedly. the Wedgie was not actually designed for). Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (haven't tried it yet). But otherwise. worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around. Especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself (real help to me staying organized!)."
5,"I have been playing guitar for over 30 years. I've owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime. My wife bought this guitar for me as a gift. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this guitar. It is a solid. well built guitar. The finish is beautiful. The pictures do it no justice. It sounds incredible. It has great tone and sustain. wonderful harmonics. The clean tones are nice and warm. The neck is fast. No fret noise or hums. The pickups are really nice. Its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it. From blues to hard rock & metal. I would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat. You cannot find a better guitar for this price. I would have expected it to cost much more. I am extremely impressed with this great guitar. You can bet. when I add the next guitar to my collection. it will be another epiphone. Well done Epiphone!!"
5,"I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. After doing research. reading reviews. and checking it out in a guitar store. I chose this one.It's much easier to play than the Squier. and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad). it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted. but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.It's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman. and I really like that the neck is smaller. It's also fairly lightweight.Overall. I'm happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe. I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again."
5,"First off. the shipping was fantastic. It shipped the very next day and came VERY well protected in perfect condition. It is an extremely well made and solid product. I think a few people have given this Les Paul a rep of just being a 'Starter Guitar'. Trust me when I say. I have no problem leaving my Les Paul Standard at home and taking this one to a gig. It plays well and the sound?? INCREDIBLE. It even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp. I can't say enough good things about this guitar it's that good. If you're thinking aout buying this guitar. don't. Just buy it!! BUY IT!!"
5,"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar. only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs. which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing. it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson. but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!"
5,"Listen.If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability. buy this one.  Period.I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work. in case the guys called for a practice session. so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.I have other. way more expensive guitars. like a Gibson ES-335. Dean 12 string. and a Fender Strat. but I gotta tell you. I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.And if it gets banged up. so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes. just for a cheap change up guitar.Dig it."
5,"I'm updating a previous negative review. I had some issues with this guitar when it arrived. I couldn't get it setup. the action was very high and I couldn't set the intonation. Notes at the 12th fret were very sharp. and I couldn't lower them with saddle adjustments. I missed one vital checkpoint. the bridge needed to be lowered. Setup is finished. and I can now agree with most reviewers. For the price. this guitar is far better than any others in the price range. I know my grandson will enjoy it. at least for awhile. If it ends up as a dust collector. I'm not out much on the purchase price. I'll add it back to my own collection. and upgrade the electronics."
5,"I got this guitar at Guitar Center. i was scared to get this guitar from amazon because of a review saying it looked like a toy. so i wanted to see it in person. i saw it. i tested it out at guitar center and it was amazing. its better than my other les paul special ii. this guitar plays great. its set up very nicely. the pickups are very nice. the electronics work perfectly. i have no problems with it. but the guitar is very beautiful. i would highly recommend getting it. i just dont know if anyone elses will be the same. not all guitars are made the same right?"
5,"A long time Planet Waves user I trusted that the circuit breaker cable would be up to their usual high standards... IMHO it is not.The plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip. I like their old cables that had a long cable protector extending from the plug allowing the cable to flow gracefully from the guitar (and into the amp at the other end). The actual cable is horrible.... it is a hard plastic outer shell and does not lie or flex well like a good cable should (e.g. like my old Planet Waves cables do). They claim that the shielding is excellent but I find it to be mediocre. Very disappointing purchase."
5,"I purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago. and have always loved it. I only use 3-4 pedals. and this is always one of them. It sounds great. is indestructable. and takes up almost no space. The controls are great. and you can get a large variety of sounds. I have played 'boutique' chorus pedals. and the Boss is loads better in every way. You will not regret this purchase.Pros:-easy to use-no hum-small-sonds awesome-indestructabecons:-NONEIf you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever. will last forever. and sounds incredible. get this."
5,"OK... I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but. I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!"
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
5,"I have had this pedal for about 15 years. just replaced the old one a month ago. It distorts sound. not quite the way you would imagine though. This effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color. I use it through a Epiphone Valve Jr and a Marshall 2x12 stack with JTM45 on top and its fine. This thing through a Champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a EQ pedal.This does just what it says it does. One Volume knob. one tone. and one distortion knob. CRANK IT."
5,"This is a distortion pedal. It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl. It's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion. The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp. You can dial the tone in. but it's a pretty harsh sounding.That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to. My amp gives me a nice warm crunch. classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound I wanted. and it does so flawlessly.It took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1. It's BOSS. so it will last forever.Th only drawback is that it's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere. Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing. but word to the wise. don't pay more than $40 new for this thing."
5,"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise. it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass."
5,"I know. I know. many people hate on this pedal. calling it &#34;stale&#34;. and &#34;generic&#34;. The problem that they have is that they simply haven't found the right settings on the pedal and the amp. because. after all. the settings on both the amp. and the pedal do make a difference. One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. I have a Digitech Bad Monkey. and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. With this pedal. I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone."
5,"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal. you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount. if necessary) and more tone control. but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range."
5,"I've had this for about 11 years now. Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market. this pedal still sells well. Not to mention. it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They're usually on the side of improving the stock tone. which I'm happy with.I've always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music. the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain. I punch it up with an overdrive. or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost. I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter. more technical styles. it's better not to have too much gain anyhow."
5,"To be honest. I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet. but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great. only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock. or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp. but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
5,"I have a lot of pedals...  In fact. I have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals (though only the MT2 and the OD3 are regularly in my rig.)  This pedal won't give you a 'cranked up tube stack' sound.  No...  Instead. it's very edgy and smooth as can be.  It has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone.  I usually use it as a mid-boost for solos.  You'll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you won't be able to replicate (easily... I'm sure the huge Boss distortion box comes close. but for the price...) with any other pedal."
5,"Its a great pedal. sound really crunchy. I got a peavy vyper sometime I use this If I want a crunchy style. but the amp I got is really good and has its own distortion styles. I use the heavy metal config on this pedal. I recomend it to anyone... does not introduce noise. I run it on the stock battery. it still works. you can make your guitar sound like Metallica or Megadeth. of course it also depends on a lot of things. like pickups. amp. etc.... I also have a very old little peavey practice amp. this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life.Listen to it on the Boss website. I heard to it and then I thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them. but it does sound really really close. regards. forgive my english... not from the U.S"
5,"This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years.  It really does have a ton of range. although it only does one effect at a time. so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock. which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.  If you want any of those 90's sounds. excluding the heavier metal sounds. this pedal will definitely get you there."
5,"I first used this pedal when my green screemer died. A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed. I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end. my search ended with this pedal. I highly recomend this pedal to any rock. blues. metal. country. or punk guitar player."
5,"Forget all the volume drop comments.  There isn't any and it does not color your tone one bit.  I have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals. They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in.  I wanted something to dress up slow ballads. and of course 'Born On The Bayou'.  This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it.  And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on. I play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it."
5,"I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. I'm old school. Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles. this pedal has a great. warm. organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot. You can barely bring it in for some warmth. or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound."
5,"This is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] Its dials allow for enormous control of the effect. [2] It's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of BOSS pedals. Further. [3] it's utterly easy to use. [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation. and. most important of all. [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo. (Note: It comes with a 9v battery installed. but it does NOT come with a power source/adapter.) If the price is more than you're willing to pay. consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO. This also delivers good tremolo. but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the BOSS product; it's still quite good. but the BOSS takes the prize. I paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"As stated in the title. this adapter is what you need if you use your Danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries. You can now plug it into the wall! As advertised. it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so I've owned it. The reason I took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesn't seem too durable. so because of this I have been very careful so it doesn't get broken. You might be able to find an off-brand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the Honeytone so you won't risk ruining it."
5,"My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal 'open' to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix. Classic. and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore. It's cry baby all the way"
5,"I've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now.  Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way.  Well. I've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect.  Also. you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little 'comb' that moves the wheel on the pot.I've tried other wahs.  Morley doesn't do it for me. and the Vox is very good. I just have always gone with what I knew.  No complaints with the Crybaby."
5,"MY experience with crybaby is it has a great tone.  More overbearing than the Vox or cleaner wahs.  BUT I know several people who have had problems with the switch. and I have watched countless others stomping on their crybaby in futile attempts to engage or disengage the pedal.I actually use a BBE and Vox since this frustration with my 1st wah.  But I am not sure that I am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance!  I kinda think I am.  The VOX and BBE seem to have a brighter sound which is less 'wah-ed' if you will.  It could be accentuated by me playing a Strat instead of the Les Paul Custom/Boogie combination I used with the crybaby."
5,"My Cry Baby is about 20 years old and is the oldest pedal on my board. I have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the Potentiometer to give the Wah a broader range but it really doesn't sound any better. This pedal covers the &#34;White Room&#34; by Cream Tone perfectly. I gave it 4 stars because it hasn't been maintenance free. The pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives. I probably should give it 5."
5,"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on. which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch. so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle. and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah. but in my experience. the sound is equivalent on the base models."
5,"this is my first petal of  any kind.  I had read that the Wah shoud be your first so I went with that.  glad I did.  this Wah petal is so much fun.  you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow.  It is hours and hours of fun.  the sounds are great.  I have had no problem with performance.  it works as it should.  I highly recommend this petal.  it's price is attractive as well."
5,"Some things just don't need to change. Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz. eq. or other wacky add-ons but WHY? I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great. The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style; everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal. It's a must have and that's really all there is to say."
5,"I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards.  But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal. it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable.  I suspected that the potentiameter was shot. so I had that replaced. but the same problems reoccurred.  Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product. but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had."
5,"This is for theKyser Banjo/Mandolin CapoThis is one of three capos I use for a ukulele.  It works. and is my second favorite.  I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele. and it is easy to add. move. remove. With the trigger-type release. it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards. and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo. Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.  UPDATE:  I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime.  Free shipping for Prime members!!!For the price and quality. this Kyser capo works on a uke. Highly recommended."
5,"You can never go wrong buying a Kyser capo.  They are made to last and really do what they are designed to do.  The great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so I don't have to have a seperate capo for each.I also have a capo for guitar made by Kyser and I can tell you that works just as well.  You can never go wrong with a Kyser.  Not only that I like the idea that it's an US company.  I've had some cheaper capos and they just don't do the job.  They either don't press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much.  This Kyser will last a long. long time."
5,"I've been using one of these Kyser's for a good while now. I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo. If you never used one. it's makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when I'm playing chords. when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on. With a little practice you'll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz."
5,"In particular. I favor the Dual Design. Why? If the need arises. it's possible to use a regular strap that doesn't have the button locks installed. I have two of the black ones on a 7 string Ibanez RG7321. and Laguna LE200QBC guitars. I have spare straps for both guitars. and sometimes I lock those spares with the plastic Dunlop discs.I have some older bass guitars with similar Dunlop locks (the standard version). two of which had locks installed in the mid 1990's. and one from 2003 with the gold DD. All three of them have held up with no issues. I didn't need to re-tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago. Then again. I don't tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as ... MetallicA. ;)"
5,"So I bought these because being Dunlop. I trust the brand. I dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky. The only problem I have is. they scare the piss out of me. Its not a 'tighten washer and nut' situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks. These have pegs that insert. Its so hard for me to trust these. I always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp I clench my guitar. So scared that the little metal balls things will just slip. peg fall out and ruin a $500 guitar. I havnet had a single problem with this system yet. and I never hope that I do. But if it happens there will be an update to this. Good product so far. just wouldn't recommend it. There is too much crap in the world to be worried about. strap locks shouldnt be one of those things."
5,"they work well. For me. the instalition wasn't that hard. it took me maybe four or five minutes. The screws provided were a bit bigger than my BC Rich Avenge Beast's stock strap system. BUT when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap (or wax- i used the bar soap though) the installation becomes easier.Once you put your strap in. its NOT comming out unless you try hard to undo the system. lol.If you need to clean your guitar strap. take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip. Its a quick and harmless way to do it and it may take about a minute or two to undo both strap locks. Its not that hard though and the reward is worth it."
5,"No complaints about this hardware.  Easy to install with patience. easy to use.  The click on/off system securely holds your strap. and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post.These work like a light switch...on/off. so I'm not sure how you can rate them as poor.  There aren't really any directions. so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.Quality metal. secure function. and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.I've installed these on a 3/4 Hoener. Full Sized Squire Acoustic. and 2 Fender Strat's."
5,"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops. and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past. on friends' guitars. semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast. these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still. the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes. making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch. using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system. and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar."
5,"The very first thing I noticed about the design is how far from the guitar's surface the strap is actually connected.  What this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitar's weight.  The &#34;fulcrum&#34; is the surface of the wood. if this makes sense. and I can't help but wonder if it could eventually (eventually over much time and use) cause cracks or splits as a result.I found someone selling only the Dunlop strap buttons. which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars. and was about to order them when I found Planet Waves Elliptical End Pins.  I think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap. unless you're going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders. and no additional stress on the guitar's body.  I've ordered a set."
5,"I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy.  I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago. and I dont recall having this issue. so I'm thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point.  I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle. and the locks are secure.  However. due to this issue. I'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks.  I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon."
5,"I'm in love with the dual design system! It works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly. There is one downside to this system. as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself. Which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap. There was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time. One component. which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions weren't much help either. The directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go. but I didn't know the name of the piece nor could I readily find it in there. After that. I installed this into my new guitar and strap and. I was ready to go. I HIGHLY recommend this! It is much easily to switch out straps w/o the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process."
5,"I replaced the Schaller strap locks on my Strat with these. The Schaller ones ground on the connecting hardware to the point where I had to oil them a few times a month or I'd end up with an audible creak.Hands-down I like the Dunlop ones more. They installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure. No problems whatsoever. I just ordered my third set a few minutes ago.I'm a total convert - every new guitar I get is going to get a set of these put on it."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
5,"I don't know if this is a common problem. but i have these on both of my basses. and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing. like metal does before it rusts. it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose. and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product. this was just one of those things i think. so I would still recommend it."
5,"I like this strap lock very strong very sturdy! Keeps things in place.. one problem.. The coating will wear out in a short time (a few months) and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside. This might make it a bit hmm I don't want to say hard to lock. but you'd better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure. Mine has un-clipped a couple times because I didn't check. Our climate is humid so it's rust friendly which could contribute to why I'm having issues. However once clipped properly you shouldn't have issues! Great buy"
5,"Strings are half the battle with stringed instruments. A bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful. and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better. Either way. stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point. These strings make my cheap ukulele sound not-so-cheap. and I imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point. I also play guitar and Martin is one of my choice brands for strings so I figured they wouldn't let me down when I decided to play the ukulele - I was correct."
5,"I've been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess I own a quiver full of the addictive things (ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between). Over the years. I've tried several different brands of string. The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them. It's just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone. Given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel. the Martin string set's relatively low cost is a nice bonus."
5,"When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording.  Once these are in position they work just fine. the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks.  The device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it.  The filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where I wanted it and to keep it there.On the plus side. the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use."
5,"I ordered this product to use for personal recording. and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it 'New.' and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First. the package was stapled. that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then. to make matters worse. there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new. I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone. I would not recommend buying from this seller."
5,"This is a decent pop filter. It gets the job done but it has a few flaws. It attracts a good amount of dust. the screen tends to mess up (which caused me to tear the first screen). & the goose neck tends to unwrap it's self out of place. It also gets shakey so I tend to have to screw it back in. Other than that. it's a decent pop filter but not for the price. Under $10 would've been better. I should have went with something cheaper than $20 *cough cough* the Auphonix pop filter *cough cough* but. I will in the future."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
5,"For the price. this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However. there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that. if I pick up the mic. the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once. but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
5,"Well thought out unit that does what it says it will. drop all that POP! I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand. And being that it is rubberized. it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent &#34;give.&#34; And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer. allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing! And then; and now for the really important part: everything stays where you last left it. Hell. even my cats can't do that. and they're porcelain."
5,"After suffering through crackles. lost signals. and all the rest. I decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the Spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through Amazon.com.  Because the new acoustic-electric classical I received as a gift has an end-pin outlet. I bought the Spectraflex with the right angle connector.  Although I have been using the cable for only a few weeks. I am very impressed.  The connections on all the guitars and basses on which I've used it are sure. with no loss of signal. no crackles.  Perhaps most impressive is the fact that I can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal.  Finally. I can be confident that when I play. something will consistently come out of the amplifier.  By the way. the old-school tweed look is a plus. too."
5,"Well. what can I say? Based on the customer reviews. this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. However. after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). And before you ask. &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;. all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. So it is definitely the cable :(Anyway. I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120."
5,"Spectraflex makes great cables. I bought this right angle 10' red cable for my older Ibanez guitar. This cable is built to be extremely durable. is made in the USA. and comes with a lifetime warrantee. The 20 gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable. and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial (especially compared to a cheaper Fender cable I had been using that required almost constant tightening.) Though Spectraflex cables are not the least expensive (nor the most expensive.) they are a great value and I am definitely a fan. I recommend this cable without reservations."
5,"I purchased three of these (three different colors) to make a mini-snake for my keyboard to their Di's.  I typically used Mogami 2524/Neutrik. but need cakes while in the road (I usually roll my own to exact length).  These have worked well. quiet. no handling noise. seem well built (I treat cables well. so I don't really test them with under tough circumstances) and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future.  They are used 6 nights a week. and after 50 uses. no problems.  I recommend them (plus. for live. the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well.).  Nice pieces..."
5,"I keep this cable on my pedal board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case. I've posted a photo on the pedaltrain Mini page. The right angle connector is great to exit the last pedal on the board and the straight connector goes into the amp. I use a Mogami silent cable -Mogami Platinum Guitar 12. Straight to Straight with Quiet Plug 12 feet- for the input to my guitar. but I can't justify paying a LOT more money for the side that goes to my amp (it's not getting bumped around. plugged and unplugged. etc.). This cable works perfect for it's purpose. Oh yeah... and it matches my tweed amp!!"
5,"Might work well for recording too when you take the output jack.  Speaker is acceptable quality but can't be compared with a Fender amp as this one has 5 watts and a small speaker and the other has 10-20 watts.  I'm opting for the convenience of the size.  I got this after getting a couple smaller amps and headphone monitor plugs since it has both and was better sound with good effects.  I like the 'brit' setting.  I sound like a rock star with it.  Good product for practice or recording.  You could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig.  But for around the same price you could get a Fender amp.  This product works for me and the quality is pretty good.  Other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this."
5,"This pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries.  We've used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up.  We are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it.  We are using an mp3 player for backup.  The sound is not quite as clear as we get with our Roland Cm-30 (so only 4 stars from me).  The micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it's nice not to have to load up cart to roll around.  Guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features."
5,"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes. but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician. I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics. mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining. I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169. you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up. I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me. a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little."
5,"Now-a-days I just search amazon because they have always got what I want at reasonable prices. This is no exception. I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. This was was better then I expected. It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit. In other words great all around. I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected. and it is lockable (with key)If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one. You will not be disappointed.Also. I ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day. No special shipping. Maybe it is my locations but that was great too. Well packed."
5,"This case it built really well. it has really nice plush interior... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck. it DOES have a lock on one of the latches. The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it. Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key... so dont worry. Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it.Above all it fits my Epi LP perfectly... as it should! hehe."
5,"As the title states. this is a lightly padded duffle bag. nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor. it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult. so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs. dings. dent & dirt. but that's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price."
5,"Well constructed with quality woods. saddle/nut and bracing. Neck and frets are straight. level and do not snag. This guitar rings like a bell. stays in tune and is light weight. Do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes. Any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play. The strings may be too high or too light or whatever. just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well. Do not buy a Luna. Davidson. Main Street. or any other 'no name' - get this one."
5,"I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em!!!!"
5,"Didn't think I'd be compelled to review something like a guitar pick. but the Dunlop Ultex has really impressed me thus far.  I use the .60 thickness. which is equivalent to the orange plastic Dunlop pick.  The orange pick is my favorite for acoustic and most electric playing. but they do wear down and fray on the edges. and have a little more friction that I'd like.This Ultex seems very resistant to wear and has surprisingly little drag over the string.  I find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold.  It gives just enough to use for smooth strumming. while being rigid enough for individual notes.Some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use.  If that turns out to be a problem. I might reconsider my review.  But out of the box. they perform as well as any pick I have used!"
5,"I like the fact that it can be &#34;partially&#34; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole (which will have to be enlarged a bit).  Either way. once plugged in. it sounds great.  This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar. a Blueridge BR-160.  I installed some Fishman &#34;under the saddle&#34; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good. if not better.  If you don't mind the pickup visible in the sound hole. this is the way to go.  Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar."
5,"Ok. so I just installed these things for my KRK 6's (no stands...just sitting on two other speakers).  What can I say?  The bass. which previously had disappeared in my studio. is now present again!  My monitors sounded kinda thin before because I was losing so much energy to my desk. but these things have made a ton of difference!  My stereo image even feels wider now!Sure. they're a little pricy. but hey...THEY WORK!  If that's what they want to charge for them. and people continue to buy them. I'm cool with that!  I'm happy with the reults my $40 got me!5/5!"
5,"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40. you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these."
5,"Some will argue that these are not necessary for your monitors. however as somebody who has worked in music for more than half their life. I can assure you that. whereas they're not life or death. they do make a significant improvement on the listening process. especially in your project studio. No. they're not going to make your music sound any better. but they will give you a more detailed and accurate bass response when your monitoring. Even cooler is the fact that the pads come with 2 extra pieces of padding that will essentially let you customize the position of the monitors in that you can angle them up or down ever-so-slightly. Lastly. although my monitors fit perfectly on the pads. I can't help but to think that if my monitors were any larger. I would need a second pair. especially if they were positioned horizontally. All and all. overpriced or not; they really make a world of difference."
5,"Long story short. this string set has a strong metallic character. which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it. but for me. absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar. so by its nature it sounds mellow. warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out. I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position. WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes. it is that bad. you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line. I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so. definitely avoid this string."
5,"I've been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time. I started playing 15 years ago. and used the slim. floppy picks for a long time. As time went on and my guitar skills grew. I needed a pick that was sturdy. and wouldn't flex to play more intricate and detailed songs.The tortex purples are my favorite. and they're the thickest ones I can find. I like the soft sandy feel of these. They don't slip out of your hand easily. and because they're so thick. they take a long time to wear out."
5,"Yes.  The 1.0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack.  If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop. the Tortex Picks are all color coded!Anyway. I've been playing guitar for about 15 years.  I've been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14.  At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.  Teardrops were too small; Fender brand were too slippery; Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly; the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me.  The 1.0mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack. don't feel too flimsy in my fingers (I keep a tight grip) and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market (gator grips feel too porous for me.)  Durability wise. I'll lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out!"
5,"I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition."
5,"I always keep a lot of these on hand.  These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals).  Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks.  These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used.  For example. I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks.  The weight is great for my style of playing.  They seem more durable than other brands.  They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand.  I love 'em. use them daily. and rely on them !!!"
5,"As a kid I learned to play the trombone proficiently. but my heart wasn't really in it. so I took up the guitar. which I love. I played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time. I recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock (I have an old Ibanez and a Les Paul Custom) and have tried several picks in that quest. There are several I have liked (and several that I haven't) but thus far my favorite is the 1.0mm Tortex (blue) picks. They have a very nice. almost powdery. matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just don't break. though the 1.0s are fairly stiff. Depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available. and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences. I won't say that I will never try anything else. but thus far I find myself picking up my 1.0 Tortex more than other picks."
5,"I absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks! They are so grippy. I haven't broken a single one yet. they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio. so it's hard to loose them. but I still do. If you have like a child. nephew. niece. sibling. or parent that plays guitar or bass you can't go wrong with getting these for them. or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little Fender picks that break if you strum a chord. and if you are lucky enough not to break them. they just slip out of your hands while you're playing. They are a little thin for rhythm playing however. and I recommend the .88 mm picks for that."
5,"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less 'clicky' - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same. I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point. so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop. they sound and feel just right to me. and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks."
5,"Ever since I started playing the guitar. I've used the nylon Dunlop picks. They're better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick. They're flexible and easy to pick with. but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break. You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them. as you can get them at your local music store for about that."
5,"I like thin picks myself. and this one is VERY thin. You won'tuse it all the time. but every now and then it can be used in the right situation. If you are a player who is somewhat meat-fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off. it is ideal. Also. if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar. it is awesome. No power chords with this little guy. but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it. The non-slippery texture and it's grippy textured surface of Dunlops is what I love about them the most. it makes them easier to hold on to. I give them a thumbs up!"
5,"They're very thin nylon picks. They're good for practicing the hand motions of strumming; they put up very little resistance. so they train you to keep your hand stable. I still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone. but I usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums. I also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking. since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don't notice with a thicker pick.They're great for what they are (thin. flexible picks). and Amazon has the best price."
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career.  I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks."
5,"Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn. nicked. picks. Rapidly.firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick. repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice."
5,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin. but for more chord strumming style playing. such as playing rhythm. the .73's are perfect. They are flexible. but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However. they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So. i dont see how you can go wrong."
5,"OK. so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything. depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However. I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw. folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
5,"alright I got tired of forking over 30 cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online. and let me tell you. these picks get the job done. don't expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that. a few of the tips broke off but I think that's my fault for playing too hard :) Great picks. would recommend to anyone."
5,"I use the Dunlop .60mm nylon picks as my current standard.  but decided to give the lighter .38mm a try.  Unfortunately.  the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar (especially in an outdoor picnic setting).  and basically unusable for that purpose.  However. I did find these were just the ticket for personal practice. allowing me to hear a  metronome or backtrack far easier.  So although they failed my original performance intention. 5 stars for filling a need I didn't even know I had.  :)"

5,"I think many/most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try.  My favorite picks for the last ~8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - they're nylon picks that have a raspy 'cat's tongue' surface that makes it super easy to grip.I've also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit. but they're not my favorite.  I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic.  These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them.  Sound-wise I don't find that they're significantly different from any other pick.  If they ever stop making Brain Picks these could very well become my #1."
5,"I'm glad I tried these. I wont order them again. I thought they might be a good alternate for my Dunlop nylon picks. not really though.Edit: Im nothing if not fair. My last review of these was in the context of my playing my Strat or sometimes my 335. I stand by that review. However. now Im playing my Godin 5th Ave and suddenly these picks are perfect. Ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars. In the end these are the picks I reach for when Im playing the Godin.I will buy these again. I changing my review from 'Just Okay' to 'Contextually Perfect'. Ok I'll add a star. your right I should add a star. There!"
5,"I've been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip. the right string resonance for strumming. and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest I've found so far for my style of playing. I'm a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely. strum more softly. and still get enough clarity and volume. I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking - they're very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks. For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal."
5,"First. I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.  I have dozens of them. they never wear out.  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band. and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable. and easy to control.Now the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself. but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable 'plinking' sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you're playing is loud music. this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics. because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.So. too bad.  I think these are great picks. but I'd like them to be made of a softer material."
5,"I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick. but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This. of course. can be very annoying. especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto. great for leads. and because of the way they are shaped don't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost."
5,"These  picks  R awsome!  I have tremmors  in my  hands  and have a hard thime with pick control.....They Have a Gell  center.  Whitch  tingles.  It feels like muscles are activating in Your Hand  GREAT THERAPUTIC PICKI seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks.These  picks have a indentation so U know where put UR thumb and index fingerThey really Do what they say....If U have hand problems.  try these.....they really work."
5,"When I first got them. I thought that they were going to be cheap. as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging. but it was ok. I wasn't expecting much from them. The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material. They did not bend at all when I tried to (and believe. me I tried). Pick wearing is virtually non-existent. and I utilize Alt-Picking a lot in my practices. I actually learned my first sweep shred (D major) with these picks within a day of getting them.I highly recommend for the shred guitarist.My only complaint. is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do (becuase of the grip) but i got used to it rather quickly.IMPORTANT!!!You can get these in 24 packs at [...] for only $10!!! Free shipping as well!Sorry. Amazon. but that is just to good a deal to pass on..."
5,"These picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone.Unfortunately. these picks did not receive a five-star rating because of their price and lack of durability.  They wear down fast.  Mine are usually worn out after a day of use and I don't think I play particularly hard.  At around $4.50 for six picks. these are some expensive pieces of plastic.However. these picks are so full of awesome that I am compelled to pay a little extra.  I will definitely be buying more."
5,"I first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks. The product description didn't mention that. but I was pleased to receive more than three!My son told me he needed some new picks. and since lately he's been playing Ozzy Osbourne songs I knew he needed a better pick than the standard Fender picks he's been playing with for three years. After hearing him play with these picks. I've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level. My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks. I wish we could choose the color. or maybe they could send a color assortment. We'll be buying these for a long time to come."
5,"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy. sharp almost. After playing a bit. the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually. it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice. you won't care."
5,"As a beginner guitarist. a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks. partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully. that makes sense).  However. when I was handed one of these. it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say. now that I have my own guitar. I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
5,"I've been playing guitar my entire life. And I've tried almost every pick there is. After hearing how great it is. I decided to buy it. It felt really small at first. and i kinda was dissapointed. I put it down. and didn't use it for quite some time. For some reason i decided to pick it back up. and after a few minutes i came to like the pick. Days after using it. i got accustomed to its size. and I became much more efficient with picking. And I no longer had to worry about the pick slipping. I can't really go back to normal sized picks now.. haha. That's like the only downside I can think of. There are many dif versions of this style. so buy em all. and try em out. If these don't work for you. you can always buy the V-pick."
5,"just to let people know off the bat i can tell you these picks are small. and if you are used to big picks these might turn you off for a while. But trust me when i say that once you get used to these picks and you start using proper technique these picks will improve your technique rapidly.i never thought i would say that a pick helped me improve playing but it does. now when i try any bigger pick i even use those picks with more skill now because of these picks. trust me if you put up with these picks for a while and you get used to them you will improve or at least i and many other people agree. :D"
5,"I like Dunlop products I used the purple tortex 1.14mm almost exclusively until I met up with this Jazz III.  And now my personal debate continues...  I like a thick pick and this Jazz III is.  I like tortex and this isn't but...I really like the orange color which makes it easy to locate if you drop it.  I rarely and I do mean rarely drop a tortex pick but this nylon might get a bit slick at times.They make 3 or 4 picks in this line with varying degrees of tip pointiness.  I like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips.This is the new and improved jazz style pick and I am still trying to figure out if I like this or the trad Fender jazz pick.  Or perhaps having a few slightly different picks laying around isn't such a bad idea after all."
5,"I bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out.  The 'gel' in the name sounded intriguing.  These are OK. the colors are bright. but otherwise they're just standard plastic picks. which on an electric I prefer nylon because it's less 'clicky' on the strings.  These are fine. and if I pull one out of my gig bag I'll use it. but overall there are other styles of pick that I'd buy before buying these again.  Nothing wrong with them. but they're just normal plastic picks. nothing special other than maybe the brightness of the colors."
5,"Not too light and bendy. not too heavy and stiff. these picks are just right. Dunlop also makes quality picks. and I have yet to break one of these. They last a long time. I am a guy so at first I wished they weren't purple. but since Dunlop only codes their sizes with certain colors I like them so much I don't really care what color they are anymore. I bought a pack of these picks for much less money at my local music store so I would recommend looking there first. Now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these. Now!"
5,"If you can't find a container and add your own sponge. then buy this.Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.I think this item should cost three bucks at most. and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.I use this one for my baritone uke. and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.If you make your own. just make sure to not let the sponge drip. ie. wring it out. and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood."
5,"Purchased this to replace the Dampit as a no drip alternative. With the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use. Distilled water will extend the life of the sponge. Overall simple and effective.However. I may have added too much humidity. Was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity. but I then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case.I do use a hydrometer but I don't think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar. but only the inside of the case.So I think the Planet Waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose. but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it."
5,"I have an electronic indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier.It is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer.The whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47%.This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier. Makes the whole house safer for the Martins.Now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity. but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system.A sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too. Just don't get water on the wood.And don't forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case. Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case.All the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms."
5,"I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy. except distilled water.  In all actuality. its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry. you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets 'hydrated?'. I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills. so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall. good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J"
5,"Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence. it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings. redesign the mount. say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen."
5,"I am in agreement with others that state this is a must-have. I battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard. This really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood. I've used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard. I rub the entire neck down before and after I play. It makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop. which I suspect is what they must've been using all these years and never told me. though I never did ask...foolish me. Since I've recently gotten into doing my own setups. where I've read many forums and posters have recommended this and I figured what the heck. it's less than $5."
5,"Especially for the price. this is a great buy.  The strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when I would slide up and down the fretboard. and I was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too.  The only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on. but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that aren't shining like they use to.  I just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure I wiped it in/off as thoroughly as possible. which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as I went from fret to fret.  Not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing.  The ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever!  Take 10-15 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor..."
5,"I have been using GHS Fast fret for over six years and it's amazing stuff. I apply just a tiny amount to the strings before I play and then wipe them down afterwards. I used to change strings every one to two months and now strings can last me a year. It's easy to control home much you put on and one can of this stuff lasts me a year or two. there isn't really any reason to just soak everything with it I don't think. I mainly use it to clean the strings. I'm really glad I found this stuff!"
5,"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name. but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product. but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret. my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me. my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too..."
5,"The tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked. especially when I've been playing a lot.  The problem. at least for me. is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides. bends. and pull-offs less fluid.  A few strokes of GHS makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience.  An alternative would be using Vaseline on my fingers. but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard.  Also. I sometimes use an Emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps. but I'd rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong.  GHS allows me to minimize that."
5,"These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company."
5,"I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before.  It just didn't seem to want to hang on. so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement.This is what I chose. and notably. I chose it for the color. just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar.So far. it's given me no problems. and it looks very nice and functions perfectly.  This is a great bargain. too. since it's certainly not an expensive accessory."
5,"I really didn't expect this guitar strap to be anything more than what it is. It's tight knit nylon with leather to attach to the strap posts. It's not a super fancy top of the line guitar strap. but it serves it's purpose well. feels sturdy enough and it's adjustable for a man of any size. I ordered it on the 20th and received it on the 23rd. no complaints here. If you are like me and do not feel that it is necessary to spend 20$ or 30$ on a guitar strap then this would suit you just fine. for 6$ you can't beat it. buy one or 2 nothing to lose here"
5,"Nothing special. Just like every other strap of its kind. I compared it to other poly straps I have and it's OK. No better and no worse. Price was good. It took a long time to come. Leather ends seem OK. I mention that because it appears to be the main complaint..I'm using it as a spare so it should be OK. I'm a little disappointed. I'm used to a higher quality from EB products. It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone. I don't perform a lot of antics on stage. it's just me and the axe. I don't expect any problems. Hope this helps. Small &#34;thumbs up&#34; to Amazon."
5,"So perhaps I don't know what shade burgandy really is. Or the picture is a bit misleading. It is as stated. although the picture shows a criss cross pattern this is just woven. As too 'DEE's reveiw... the buckle doesn't seem to bother me. I am not calling him or her out or anything. My best guess. it's playing style. I myself play bass. when I first started I played on the 3' inch straps and found they bothered me. went to the 2' straps proplem solved. I am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother. But for me and the way I play... No complaints."
5,"This is my second Ernie Ball strap i have gotten. and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them. These straps have leather ends that hold the guitar securely. the strap itself is a step down from a seatbelt (If a seatbelt will keep me in place at high speeds this strap will keep your guitar in place at low speeds). and the length would be sufficient even if you are 7 ft. tall. Coming in several different colors to match any color guitar this is the only strap i will buy in the future."
5,"I like the durability of it. and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be. but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
5,"Holy guacamole. you guys- this amp...I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND.Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase. then decided to try once more.Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking.I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it. I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone. Haven't cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but I'm sure it'll sound awesome too."
5,"Just got this stand today.First impressions are always important. and this stand gave me a good impression.It seems to be made solid enough. not like some cheap off brand crap.The base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over.The telescope mechanism is quite well made.Comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters.I got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall. It's quite the perfect height for when I'm seated on my stool.One thing I did not quite like about the construction is the crew on rod to the base place. It unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved. Maybe adding something to keep it screwed in?Would recommend to others.Probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs."
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
5,"I bought this recently and I love it. Why?  It has no &#34;smell&#34;. it leaves no residue on your hands. it's very &#34;light&#34; but yet it cleans. shines. and polishes your guitar beautifully.  It leaves a protective coating on the guitar which not only protects the finish. it also makes it ultra-shiny glossy and brings out the rich deep colors. This is fantastic stuff. If you own a guitar this is the best product out there. But what else can you expect from a US company like Gibson. I was very suprised that it was this effective. This little bottle goes a long way. I have already polished all of my guitars and my friend's guitars and I still have more than 1/2 a bottle left. If you need to polish your guitar look no further. This is your best choice."
5,"I sent it back. probably due to my ignorance.  Has multiple patterns to collect sound.  Was a clear mike but I didn't detect any body to the sound.  Maybe a preamp would have helped.  I checked out many mikes and ended up with a Rode NT-1A which is probably similar in character.  My goal was to record my voice without color and this came close.  I wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars?  Suspicious ratings to me.  Now that I have more experience I would be curious to check it out.  But since I found a good solution I don't think it's worth the effort."
5,"Ok here's the deal...I'm just a small home studio type of guy. and honestly I wasn't expecting much when I shelled out the $120 for this mic.  I have just always seen it around and I thought it would be a solid choice for my first multi-pattern mic!  The first time I recorded with it. I had it on omni mode and played some acoustic....it sounded amazing!  I can't believe this mic is that good.  Crisp. clean sound (who cares if it's made in China like that one guy says?). and very flexible usage.  I've since used it on toms. acoustic. a room mic for amps. and even some background vocals. and it has shined every time!So if you're like me and looking for a low-price LDC with multiple patterns. GET THIS.  You won't be disappointed at all!  :)"
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
5,"Years ago I used the Clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. I couldn't tell from the picture. that these were full size. and I didn't check the size in the description.  I still had a few of the small ones. so I used them as templates. to cut these down. I would have rated them higher. if I could have used them as is. It's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks. but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm (Orange) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks. 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper."
5,"Seriously. this is a great pedal. I can't improve upon what others have said. but I will mention a few points.1. I use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone. or to add more crunch to my Fender Frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop. It's run before time based effects (delay. phaser. etc) for me.2. I sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster. while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies.3. If it gets noisy or 'self oscillates' after a while. change the battery to a fresh one. Better yet. use an AC adapter.I found out about the last issue after reading a few Harmony Central reviews. Otherwise. it's been on my setup for about seven years. I take care of my stuff."
5,"Well. just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours...I still think it takes a bit of brightness on bypass but when it's on it's great! I've been thinking on using it mainly as a boost for leads but it sounds so much better with it i can't seem to turn it off!it's light. small and it looks well built but only time will tell how resistent it is but hey for 30 bucks it's a great deal!This is a good EQ for an excelent price. not an excelent EQ so i give it a 4 out of 5 and look forward to testing some others danelectro pedals."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
5,"I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting it's EQ. Most distortion pedals I plugged into it ended up sounding way to &#34;bassy&#34;. and so I bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little. I really didn't expect much since this pedal was so cheap; and for a brand new one at that; I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids. If you're looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar. I'd recommend this."
5,"These Danelectro pedals are great quality for the money. I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more 'brilliance' to the tone. The case is plastic. not very attractive. and perhaps not very sturdy. Also the button to push down for the effect leaves a bit to be desired -- it doesn't feel very solid. But I intend to use this more for recording than live use. so I'm not worried about that. Anyway. there aren't many EQ's on the market. and for the price. it can't be beat. I would recommend it."
5,"What can I say. they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still. after all of these years and innovations in strings. Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!"
5,"I originally purchased these strings because of the 11-52 gauges. I wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around 12-54. Upon installing these strings. I can't really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge. but maybe it's too small to notice with the naked eye. I'm not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old DAddario strings that they replaced. They might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new. The guitar that I'm using them on. is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway. so everything sounds nice and smooth. Overall. I'm satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings. but I don't think I'm ready to give up DAddarios yet."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
5,"Heard good things about the Ernie Ball Slinky string set and decided to give it try on our son's Taylor GS Mini.  Replaced the worn out strings out of that guitar and he is back in business.  Honestly though. it is hard to really compare strings. these seem fine and currently I see no reason to try another brand.  In conclusion. I see no reason not to buy and install these again.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
5,"These guitar strings are nothing special. and based on the amazingly low price nobody should expect them to be. They work well. look good. and are fairly durable at a very low price. I was remodeling an old Behringer and all I wanted was a fresh. shiny set of new strings. For playing. they sound pretty good. Best part. in my opinion. is that they're made in America. as well as the majority of Fender products. If you want to spend the extra money. I'd stil recommend Ernie Ball over these. or perhaps simply a higher quality pair of these Fender strings. You get what you pay for. As far as shipping. Musician's Friend did a great job getting the order out quickly. I'll be ordering from Musician's Friend again."
5,"I bought a guitar and for a while used the strings that were provided with it.  After a month of using those strings I decided to replace them since I was having trouble keeping the low E string in tune.  I put these strings on and compared to the &#34;default&#34; strings. it was almost silky and softer by comparison.I'm guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel. The sound was much nicer to my ears as well.  They were relatively inexpensive and made a great choice for replacing the strings on a new guitar."
5,"These are the Gold standard for all Strat type electrics. Fender or not.  I put these 150's on all of my Strats regardless of the brand.  They are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great.  I tend to play my Strats a bit rougher than my Gibson's or acoustics so these are well tested in my house.  I get a bit carried away with amp volume and tend to bend the strings a bit.  I will continue using these on all of my Strats until I find something better which I haven't yet.  I do use other strings on other types of guitars and you can see my reviews on those as well.These are bullet proof.  They take a pounding and last as long as you could expect!!!"
5,"I use Fender strings and I have used many other brands as well.  I like Nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound.  I change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit I can go 2 to 3 weeks for hard playing.I started using Fender strings with the Stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat.  They sounded great.  I use these for my telecaster in 10 -46 (factory spec) and they are real nice too.I do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets.  I have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period.  Stick to nickel and you will be glad you did!"
5,"I've used quite a few strings out there and imo these are the best for feel. sound and overall quality. If you play Fender instruments you can't go wrong using their strings. Of course strings are a subjective thing so to each his own but I will say I used 2 different strings most of my life but was in a guitar store one day and picked up a Tele and was immediately impressed with the strings. I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were D'Addario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender. So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well. Been buying them ever since and love them."
5,"I've always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this medium/light set and I was not disappointed. There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging. They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings. I've always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to. Would recommend to any level of guitar player!"
5,"I've used GHS medium bronze wound strings on my Martin D-18 for several years. I thought I'd give these Ernie Ball strings a shot after reading reviews. They are lighter than I expected. They are closer to 'light' than medium. I'm not that impressed. They sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets. I think the next set I buy will be medium and probably GHS. You never know until you try.Update: I've gotten used to the 'sound' of these strings and I DO like that they are easier on the old fingers when playing. Pure Bluegrass players like to torture their fingers with heavier strings to get that mellow BG sound. though. ;) At my age I need all the help I can get. so I'll have to admit that I like do like these strings."
5,"I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. The sound I get from the AD&G strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. The strings seem to hold up well. I cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. These strings sound great. I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing."
5,"I have owned two of these stands. The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared. The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place. Not the greatest stands by any means. but for what they're worth. I didn't mind spending another $10 to get one. Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable. But price. ability to collapse. and it's light weight made it the one I bought... again."
5,"I love these little guitar stands. They are small enough to go anywhere with you. and they are cheap enough that you can keep a couple of them around. Which is good if you are as clumsy as I am.The last two of these that I have owned met untimely deaths. The first was on stage and since it is so small I tripped over it on the back of the stage. The second one I tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage. I know. I know... but they really are cool little stands. and I just bought another one lol. I am a glutton for punishment!"
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
5,"This stand seems to be made especially with the Fender Stratocaster in mind and might also be a perfect fit for other Fender guitars.  On my Les Paul the cable plug on the guitar is exactly where the bottom holder bar is.  If I adjust the guitar so the plug is not on the bar. the guitar sits at an angle where the guitar might tip over on it's side.Needless to say I will use this stand for my Stratocaster but I am purchasing a different model for the Les Paul."
5,"I knoew I did not want any holder that took up too much room in my music room. not did I want something that would tip over if I blew air on it. My instructor of the guitar suggested I really read the information about all of the holders and then make my choice of the one that seemed to be light-weight yet sturdy to not fall over. looked professional. and could be the possibility of THE one I would recommend and purchase again. I really like the stability of the one I bought."
5,"I take workshop style guitar courses at a local Vo-Tech in a room that could not be any less suited to the purpose. People set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall. Bad scene (sounds like an old 'El Kabong' cartoon). and not what I want to have happen to my new Seagull Artist series guitar. This little Fender stand easily folds up into a package small enough to fit in the storage pocket of my deluxe TRIC case so I can take it with me to class.It's not the sturdiest. most secure or most stable design out there. but given it's extreme portability and the use I'll put it to. it's going to work great."
5,"I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didn't have to. The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me! So it's like that guy who asks for a lighter...uses it...and puts it in his pocket every single time. these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter.I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers.It's a decent tool at a good price so buy one...Then see how long you can own it!"
5,"I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams. but alas. I was wrong. The winding apparatus works beautifully. but the cutter doesn't allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference. so I'm back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. All in all. a good product to have if you don't have pliers on hand or don't mind getting a closer snip.I cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn't have pegs - luckily. the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge. which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. Each to their own. I suppose."
5,"The winder works well for me. and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I don't have to search out a pair of snips). but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward.  Also. the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy. and doesn't work well for reluctant pins.  I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more. but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter. so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon."
5,"I was a bit concerned about this tool after reading some reviews that owners had damaged expensive guitars. but thought I would just be careful with it.  But I have no concerns after using it on two string changes.  In fact. I cannot see how one could nick the guitar while winding. since the tool does not even cover the entire tuning key so it never gets close the guitar head.  The string cutter works great. one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly.  The pry tool for acoustic guitar pegs works. and though it is a tighter fit than I expected. it does work and means I don't need to find a pliers.  Overall. I am very pleased and saved time on string changes."
5,"String changes usually take me 10 to 12 minutes each but I restrung all 3 of my guitars in less than 13 minutes (one is a floating tremolo). The spanner is smooth. the cutter is strangely very clean cutting (usually use electrician wire dykes) and the pin puller is nothing fancy. but does the trick quickly. Awesome little tool and very impressed with it. A++++ on every function. would consider maybe putting a few small rubber inserts on the handle for those sweaty hands. but other than that. it's perfectly perfect. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
5,"After getting tired of spending a half hour each time changing strings. I finally caved and bought this nifty little gadget. I just wanted a string winder at first but thought this one was kinda cool and reasonably priced too. I didn't expect the string cutter to be as well as it is. I thought my wire cutters would be much better but the cutter on this baby is just as great! It also has a pin puller which I haven't tried yet but I'm sure it's great as well. This would be perfect for the gigging or traveling musician. or if you just want a great all in one tool. But this thing!"
5,"Primarily purchased to have a string cutter in the guitar case rather than going to get one from my tool box.Found the pin puller did not really work for me. so put my old string winder from 20 yrs. ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine. Seemed no matter how I tried. I was almost scratching the saddle tried to get that groove under the head of the pins and could never get it to work on a six string steel acoustic guitar.It seems that &#34;C&#34; shaped opening in the end is for stretching strings. and I find that is better done by hand. So really I just use this for the wire cutter feature.  And the string winder itself also works well."
5,"For about $8 you get a string winder. string cutter and an acoustic peg remover all-in-one.What more can you ask for?Mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use.I have nice wire cutters. etc (I'm an EE) but it is much easier to grab one tool instead of two or three.As for quality. it has an unconditional guarantee. see above.Planet Waves -aka D'Addario- is a well-known name in guitar accessories.To the reviewers complaining about the tool breaking. try using your warranty instead of whining.No manufacturer has a perfect run forever. but at least in this case you have not wasted your money.For the record. I do not work for D'Addario / Planet Waves - but I would not dismiss a job off-hand if they offered it  ;-)"
5,"Finally. a winder that has features and durability designed into it.  The pocket of the winder head appears to be large enough to handle any tuning peg head size and the molded plastic body appears to be thick enough to stand up to a lot of use.  The pivot point doesn't bind when using the winder as has a couple other cheaper models I've purchased (and thrown away) over the years.  The string cutter is a great feature and appreciated. works well regardless of string composition type....stainless. chromes. core-types. etc.  The price seems fair enough.  I've seen a couple of battery powered models for not much more money. but if you're in that big a hurry to change strings you're living life too fast...... get a 'roadie' to do it for you.... why have to remember to carry spare batteries."
5,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking. bending. becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy. you'll love it. and if not. you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
5,"I own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough. I don't really enjoy changing strings but it needs done. this tool makes it such a breeze I don't know how I ever went without it. It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings. I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever. I am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from Planet Waves."
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
5,"When i bought this. i didn't think it was going to be as good as it is. It seemed a little plastic-ie from the photos. so i didn't think it was going to hold up very well. It actually really surpassed my expectations however. The winder itself works quite well. and has slots for multiple-sized tuners. It was a little wobbley on my guitar. but still worked well. The wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem. For 7 dollars. it's a really good deal!"
5,"I have purchased and used many various types of Guitar String Winders and I must admit that the Planet Waves Pro Winder is the very best I have used to date.  It is an all in one and there is no need to carry extra equipment to cut the strings....pull pegs..etc.  It is sturdy and should last  many moons and cut many strings before needing replacement.  Because of the affordable price on Amazon I will be buying some for my friends as Christmas Stocking Stuffers.  The Planet Waves Pro Winder is well worth the cost and I recommend it to anyone.  Also. with the string winder I also purchased accoustic guitar strings and requested regular shipping (free shipping) which promised that the items would be shipped within 5 to 7 days. The items were ordered on the Thursday and received on the Saturday....THREE SHORT DAYS...Treat yourself!  Thank you Amazon!"
5,"I never had one of these until I had to twist each tuner around 60 times to change a string.  But that's not a problem any more.I used to go through my hardware drawer at home to find wire cutters to trim my string ends.  But that's not a problem any more.And I used to hurt my teeth sometimes pulling tough bridge pins on my acoustic.  But that's not a problem any more either.All solved by one simple tool which is inexpensive and fits easily in my case.  So I'm a fan.  You'll be too."
5,"After you have used this tool for the first time. you say to yourself....&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there. winding forever by hand. With this winder. you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts. that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;. I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
5,"i use to use my hands to turn the tuning pegs and let me tell you that takes forever to take off strings and put them on. also my wire cutter is getting messed up from cutting strings and now that i have this i can change strings faster and i dont have to look for a wire cutter all the time.its small and can fit in the pouch of a guitar case also for people who are new to guitar you dont use this to tune its to put strings on and be careful not to over tune because you will break strings.hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning. this is just to get the tuning in the ball park and then using your hands."
5,"I love this system.  Every time I change strings now. I go through every step of this system. and what a difference it has made.  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great.  I never realized how dry the wood was.  The string cleaner is nice too.  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this.  The quantities of product in this kit are good. and the instructions are clear.  The two polishing cloths are adequate size. and washable."
5,"the best thing I've purchase for my guitars this year . I'm not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning . the 01 and 02 are the best. restore the live of my fretboard. the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine . the only one that I've just use once is the string conditioner and cannot say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i don't play with it after the cleaning .but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioner.you can buy this with your eyes close. you wont regret the purchase."
5,"While I'm spectacle on what I want to &#34;clean my baby with (Fender P Bass) and after reading many feed backs on Amazon. I decided to try this kit. My Bass is not that old. but really needed to be cleaned and polished. This kit really make it so clean. it looks better than when I purchased it new. No greasy residue either. My fret board looks so good to. Just don't use it on maple wood (the lighter color). at least that is what the directions states because it my yellow this lighter color. I can tell you that the rose wood is nice and deep colored red. The other cleaners and polishes are great too. I will definitely purchase this kit again when I run out of the supplies."
5,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect but have a few old guitars with pretty weathered looking fingerboards.  I figured I'd give this a try.  I am so glad I did.  I could not believe how much residue was on the rag after I cleaned the fret board. yuk.  Then I used the 02 treatment product to treat it and it really brought out the natural color.  I'd like to say it looks like new. but the guitar is a 1967 so that would be a stretch.But it looks a heck of a lot better. almost new.  I used it on one of my less valuable acoustics. but it's still a '67 USA made Fender.  I have such faith in this that I'm going to do my '77 Gibson acoustic next.Then I have a couple of electrics I will do when I change strings on them.  This stuff is great."
5,"Nice little kit. it has 800 grit sandpaper in it. I hadn't noticed that in the listing. maybe I overlooked it. I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade. The 600 made it glassy smooth again (wet sanding) - I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me.I had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board. Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible. I was miserable. my guitar sounded like s***.After 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bob's your uncle. good as new. I'm going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitars.Nice little kit. I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days. Works a charm on acoustic guitars. haven't tried it on the electric guitars yet."
5,"I bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape.  I guess this kit works okay. but it's hard to use.  It will probably last my entire lifetime.  I think a smaller kit would have been better.  You really need to remove the strings when you use it. so you have to take off all the strings.  I usually only replace one string at a time when I am changing strings. so I had to change my habits.  If you have a guitar without a truss rod. that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you're done changing the strings. since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time. and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned.  I'm no expert. but I have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent.  However. since I love my guitar. I use it anyway."
5,"I cleaned and oiled the fretboard on my straocaster the day after I received the product. The cleaning product worked very nicely but the oil was hard to get out through the applicator. The fretboard turned out nicely though so I decided to give it a 4 instead of a 3. I have to say though that I believe a big bottle of eye glass cleaner to clean the fretboard with and a good furniture polish would work just as well. Since you only use a small amount the kit will last a long time so it isn't a bad buy. Just remember it isn't recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it. If you want to use this type of product then I recommend this one."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
5,"I use earnie ball strings as my backup strings. They don't have as nice and clear a tone as my d'addario or curt mangan strings. nor do they have the life expectancy. however they are cheaper and really easy to bend. Since I can't afford to restring with the more pricey strings every single time. I go with these when I'm practicing. They do break alot when I play some crazy solos. which blows. and is the main reason why I'm not giving them 5s. (No it's not my technique. I've never broken a string on any other brand strings I've tried.) When I'm in the studio recording. I prefer. like I said before. D'addario or curt mangan strings. however to save money. I practice with these strings and I think it's not a bad method. as I go through strings like doritos (I eat doritos alot)."
5,"I read a review saying that there bridge was floating out & the strings were hard to tune aswell as their e string popping. I had the exact same experience but i bought two sets since i know uncoated strings dont last long. so i did get to play em but all my strings (except the A & E) popped on both sets within two weeks i knew it was due to my bridge being made to use a whammy bar (which it came with btw)& the tension it put on my tuning pegs what really got me upset about these strings was that they damaged my tuning pegs and now there harder to turn (have to use pliers sometimes) but the strings sound great & if i get a better guitar i might get these more often but for now im staying w/ medium gauge elixirs."
5,"These strings actually save you money because you don't have to change em much. I keep em on a year or so and I play alot. out door indoor. constant abuse. they never rust. When they break I change em.now..I'm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so I like not having to change em..they really hold up. There are better sounding strings yes. But if your plugin in anyway. you can tweak the tone.The tone isn't bad. just not as good as a martin uncoated string.but if you like longevity and less squeak. these are great."
5,"I ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends.  They didn't care at all for nanowebs which are widely available. but swore by the quality of the polywebs.  By some sort of mixup I got nanowebs by mistake.  I requested a return to get the proper item. and the seller offered to send me the polywebs and told me to keep the nanowebs for the trouble.  I haven't had a chance to test either set of strings out but I'm sure they'll be great.It's my understanding that the polywebs could practically be the last set of strings you ever buy (with some proper care).  I've been told that while nanowebs last longer than normal strings. they don't measure up to the polywebs."
5,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned. sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned. sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
5,"I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store.  Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string.  Have 2 problems with the strings.  First. the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up.  Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir).  I have changed strings many. many times. so I am convinced it was not my stringing. but a weakness in the E string itself.  Second. the high D (8th string) seems 'dead'; it does not 'ring' as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets I've used).  Considering these strings cost much more than others. I certainly am disappointed in them.  Hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good."
5,"I kinda strayed away from the Elixir brand for a little while just 'To See' if another brand would sound 'better' and in doing so. I wasted time and money.(but I did get some EXPERIENCE) I'm back with the Elixirs now and have no intentions to 'Experiment' any more.Simply put............Elixir makes the best Strings for an Acoustic Guitar that I've tried and I 'Will Stick with them' because they have Great Sound. last a long time. easy to clean and prevent rust and/or corrosion."
5,"Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings.....to the less and also most expensive strings.  I find the Elixir excellent. My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet. That may change along the way.However. I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine.  What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else's palate.  Therefore. strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear.My ears remain attentive to future string sounds.  I also love the d'Addario make.  Which I purchase through Amazon...always."
5,"After about a month and a half I have noticed some corrision on the A and D strings at the 4th fret.  That is a little disapointing because these are suppost to last 3 to 5 times longer than 'regular' strings.  I like the way they sound.  They are a little harder to play than the D' Addario strings that I am used to on my other guitar. and the Martins that I have used in the past.  If I still have to change them every 2 or 3 months they are not really worth the extra cost."
5,"I read several reviews before purchasing these strings. I've never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my Yamaha acoustic. it sounded great! They have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar. My Yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is. If you're wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings. definitely give these a try. The coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not. but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board."
5,"Time will tell if they last longer than strings 1/3rd the price. Visually. they don't appear any different than cheaper Bronze wound strings. I was expecting something different. but as far as sound goes. the strings tuned well and only required some stretching 3 times to get them to stay in tune. even after playing &#34;smear notes&#34; on several songs. My problem with cheaper strings (De'Angelo) was they would tarnish or rust quickly. the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar. The company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last 3 to 5 times longer. I'll know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not. Since these are literally triple the cost. I'll know if it was worth the extra expense. Hopefully these are made in the USA instead of China like most other things we buy in America. Good or bad. once I see the longevity of this set. I'll add to this review at that time."
5,"I've been playing guitar for about 15 years - and within the last year bought my first Taylor guitar (Taylor Guitars 414CE-LTD Grand Auditorium Acoustic Electric Guitar). It came with these Elixir strings on it from the factory. I am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce. What's even better is how long they last.I'm pretty hard on my strings. I useDunlop Standard Tortex Picks. 12 Pack. Purple. 1.14mmwhich are very stiff. and chew up strings very quickly. The nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several MONTHS instead of weeks. They're a little bit more expensive then other major string brands. But after about a year of listening to these (only gone through 3 sets so far). they're worth the extra few bucks."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
5,"I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them."
5,"I tend to sweat when I play. so coated strings are a necessity for me.  These are as good as any coated string on the market. I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings.  Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string. These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well.  Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play!  Oh. and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them.  The guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it."
5,"Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy. sealed looking fretboard. that doesn't have that problem. but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's. but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands."
5,"I get everything on Amazon now.  Need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping.  Elixir is what Tom Anderson uses and I trust his judgment.  He makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course. Have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings. I do Not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time.  Stretch them bend them and they don't break.  If your bending a couple steps or more then I would love to know what string holds up consistently.  Thanks much."
5,"Yes. these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now I've put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and D'Addario on my acoustics. but no more. I'm only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do. however. seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it."
5,"While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled. the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very. very smooth to play and the sound is amazing. I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric. and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat. mellow. sweet sound."
5,"Without changing my pickups or polishing my frets. I thought I'd try to get a little more sustain switching up strings. At first I thought I had got a bum buy because the I had to bring the action up a bit to account for the over brightness of the strings. Had my tone all off and I was ready to dig my other set back out of the trash..... played on it for a half hour (went through the exact same thing with the Polywebs I put on the RG655) then retuned. sounded pretty good. Played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now. Dropped the action back down and it's smooth as silk in an hour's time. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
5,"I liked my Elixir strings on my acoustic. so I knew that the ones for electric would be worth the extra money (as compared to non-coated brands).  They seem to create less noise from unintentional slide friction--it's sort of like the difference between flatwound and regular strings--these feel like super-flatwound strings. meaning they feel smooth.  I have some nice callusses built up. but I imagine that I'd like these strings even more if I was just starting out (or restarting) because I imagine they tear up your fingertips much less than non-coated strings."
5,"Elixir strings are very nice.  so slick and last forever compared to standard strings..But i will admit D addario strings are just as good but have to be replaced more often. So if you have the money and want to try these technology advanced strings i dont think you will be disappointed. Some people say they are too slick.. and i can see that when you put new strings on you expect them to feel a certain way..  But you will get over that once you see how long they last."
5,"These are my favorite brand of strings.When i was a beginner a few years back these were the 1st strings i bought on my electric (since i used them on my acoustic) And i have to say. elixir is my favorite brand of strings. They last long. are easy to tune. & have a nice bright sound & if you take proper care of them (wipe them down when your done playing. keep the guitar in your gig bag when your not using it. ETC.) that bright sound can last about 6 MONTHS OR MORE!! i usually just buy about two sets a year & im a HEAVY player i play about 2-7 hours EVERYDAY. I love the coating aswell but the medium gauge & up usually don't have that other coating you can get on the light gauge strings. but overall these strings are awesome & are a must buy for every guitarist!"
5,"These strings sound great. play great. and the coating really does keep down the squeaking. Some purists don't like the coating movement when it comes to strings. and it does take a micron off the treble. but they last a loooong time. I usually only have to change my strings once a month. I use them on my Washburn acoustic guitar. and play rock. folk. and country strumming. They rock. and I feel they are the best strings around today. period.  These strings are very small. and are great for playing for long periods of time. without brutalizing the fingertips. Some people say the real light strings are not good for recording. and you probably have less of a bass boom. but I like 'em."
5,"I have been using these strings for 7 years.  At first I used the Elixir Polywebs. but those things broke all the time.  I switched to these and haven't broke a string since.  If you play a Gibson or Martin I would buy a heavier string. but these match well with my 414ce Taylor.  Because of the price I don't use these on my cheap Fender Acoustic. for that I suggest Earthwoods.  I even use the Electric version of these strings on my American Srat. very pleased there as well."
5,"I own aTaylor Guitars 355-CE Jumbo 12 String Acoustic Electric Guitarand it came with these strings on it. 12 string guitars are generally hard to play for long periods of time. so they might not get as much use as a regular 6 string. The tone from these strings is just as bright and clear 8 months later. and they still hold their tuning like they after the first 2 days. Elixir strings are in general more expensive than other major brands - but the extra few bucks are worth it because the sounds stays so clear and consistent after extensive use. They are great strings on any guitar."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I was a little reluctant to try the EVO XM as I have a Vendetta and the tuners are junk.  Fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issue.It's a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup.  Action is incredible.  Almost too low for those that do a lot of stretching but great for those that are into fast riffs.  The difference in tone between the neck and bridge pickups is great and the pickups are very responsive.Hardware is slightly better than expected for this price point."
5,"This is my second 4 way switch and it won't be the last. The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series. which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1.2.or 3. I am very pleased with the &#34;new sound&#34; of my tele. The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun. (don't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder)."
5,"I got these for a parts-tele I built and I'm really happy with them.  Like all vintage tuners you may need conversion bushings to make them fit modern peg holes which are usually larger.  But they look great. work great. stay in tune and are completely vintage spec.  I have a '57 reissue strat and I can't tell the difference.  One thing I've always loved about vintage tuners is that you tuck the strings in the center of the shaft so it keeps the headstock looking neat."
5,"These Fender string guides are replacing the old style string guide(tree). Installed on a Tele I built. Much less surface of the string touching. Very smooth action when using the vibrato. Took no more than 10 minutes to install.. Reasonably priced. super upgrade. I recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar. These look like rollers. but are not rollers. They do work well. and I will purchase more for other Tele's and StratsPros: Well made  Cons; None I can think ofSleek. well designedQuick installImproved soundInexpensive upgrade"
5,"Not a drop in replacment for many Fenders. I installed these on a Fender Marauder and needed to drill holes in the head stock. You can't see it really well in the picture but there is a metal plug on the bottom next to the screw hole that needs a hole to fit into.I sweat some bullets and used the smallest drill bit I own. and stuck a piece of tape 1mm from the tip so I wouldn't drill too deep. It is important to make the hole STRAIGHT in line from the screw hole so they don't go on crooked. I also had to drill the screw holes about 2mm deeper because the screws that come with this go deeper into the headstock.Now that they're installed I can attest that the guitar holds it's tune better and it's easier to tune. Before it would not respond for many pegs until twisted too far then it would suddenly break lose and be too sharp/flat. That happens far less now."
5,"People complain that these aren't really rolling string trees. despite the fact that the description *never* says or even implies they are. in fact. 'rolling' string trees.  Honestly. they don't need to be. at least for most guitars.  These small. round guides are superior to the flat. wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings.  Less contact means less friction. less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don't have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move.I put them on a cheap Telecaster copy I have and noticed the results immediately. and I did not replace either the tuners or the nut. those are still the cheap stock parts.If you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot. rollers might be a little better. but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade (anyone can change them. all you need is a screwdriver). it was a no brainer for my Telecaster."
5,"A great. clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps. The guides on these are not rollers. but are the next best thing visually and performance wise in my opinon.  The only guides that I like better are the round 50's guides for Tele's. but then I like those asthetically only on Tele's.  An inexpensive mode that looks and works great.  To the inexperienced eye this simple. clean looking mod can make a Mexican or Chinese instrument look more like the made in America models."
5,"I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar. so after some research online and talking to friends. I bought this capo.It goes on easily.comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar. Downside. seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings. I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekend.Let me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know. Thanks!"
5,"In 40+ years of using many Jim Dunlop products Made in America or to his standards of quality. I've never broken or worn out the capo. I use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars. The spring tension remains strong after several years. which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing. The only problem I have with them. they seem to disappear when I'm not looking. I have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use. Other than smudges from getting the capo dirty. it cleans easily."
5,"I haven't used it a lot yet. but I really like it so far.. Much easier to put on than the 30 year old capo I was using. and it works for my guitars and my banjo. without putting them out of tune. It seems to be solidly made as well. and not too much pressure as others said.. My old capo put a lot more pressure than this does :P. and was much heavier. I'd assume it was made out of Cast-Iron or something instead of Aluminum."
5,"How you feel about a capo has almost as much to do with the guitar you're using it on... What works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another... I can say with confidence that this capo works flawlessly on an American Standard Strat... Fits great. easy on/off. easy adjustments. The padding on the capo is such that you would really have to go out of your way to mar the finish on your neck with it... All relevant areas of the capo are well padded. It seems very well constructed. after two weeks of heavy use. I don't see why it wouldn't last for years."
5,"I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.  They definitely look great. but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so.  That's my experience at least.  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people. but they are wonderful.  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out.  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one.  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!"
5,"Although it is touted for acoustic guitars. it works well with my Ibanez Electric as well as my dreadnaught and acoustic/electric. The spring is tough and it holds securely. On and off is a quick process if you have the hand/finger strength to operate it. I rate it 4 stars only because I just received it and haven't had a chance to use it much. But. I like it so far. It was delivered quickly. It does the job. I'll update after I've had it for awhile."
5,"This is actually the first capo I have ever owned. as I am pretty new to playing the guitar. That being said. I paid close to $14 with free shipping for this capo. and I feel it is a good value. It feels well constructed. like it won't break if I drop it. The capo fits nice and tight on all six strings. Ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitar's neck. The spring mechanism is plenty tight. but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed. even while playing. The capo is sleek looking. and a bit smaller than I was expecting at 3&#34; x 3&#34;. but I have no frame of reference for comparison.Item was shipped on time. and packaged in the original Dunlop packaging. Part number: 83CB. Made in USA! No counterfeit here. If you have any questions. feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can. Thanks for reading.SPO"
5,"...but for a small woman with small hands. it's difficult to operate.  It also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings. which can't be good for them.  I ordered a Schubb brand capo that's much easier to operate and doesn't smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable.  The only drawback to the Schubb is you can't clip it to the headstock. a convenience that's important to a lot of professional musicians.  I'm keeping both. if I need the convenience of this clip on style I'll use it.  When playing at home I'll use the more gentle Schubb."
5,"I have used Fender Medium picks since the late 60's.  Yes. they are made in China now (!!) but they are still the same pick as far as I can tell.  The picks arrived fully sealed in an outer envelope and contained within a nice little mini zip-lock baggie.  All 12 were in there. all of them Fender Mediums.  (purchased from B&G; Music Associates)  Shipped from Illinois to California in 3 days with normal shipping.The picks are great and I couldn't be happier with the order. Whatever issues occurred with missing picks and poor shipping no longer exist from where I stand.  Recommended if you want/need a nice little bag of Fender Mediums."
5,"Even though the title says 'Acoustic Guitar Case'. it's obvious that this is a case for A-style mandolins. I chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo. and the reviews were good. Sure enough. the lining is soft and well-padded. The hardware works as it should. and the build quality is almost perfect. However. when closing the case. a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly. Just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to snap in place. then everything is as it should be. The case fits my A-type mandolin perfectly. and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around. The slight mis-fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case. It serves its purpose well. at a reasonable price."
5,"When I bought my first guitar about 6 months ago I just chose a pack of picks on Amazon's list of 'other buyers also bought this' and those were these Fender 351 picks.At the time I figured all picks were created equal.Since then I've tried various sizes and brands - Dunlop. Planet Waves. etc.But I keep coming back to this Fender 351 Medium pick for both my electric and acoustic guitar.The sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too trebly.The Planet Waves picks all seem to be a little muddy-sounding.I've found a winner with these Fender picks and will definitely be ordering more."
5,"I bought these picks because I liked the color of the picks.These picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are. I play guitar everyday for around 3-5 hours a day and I have yet to break one of these picks. Very nice quality and very cool color to them. They are also priced very good.Much cheaper buying them here at amazon instead of a quarter a piece at the guitar store. Recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar. Additionally. they are very fast at shipping them to your door. Three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step."
5,"These picks far exceed my expectations. I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest. nicest looking picks I own.  They look great. feel great and play great.  Call me a snob. but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself. buy these.I love the color and texture too. they don't slip or move around as you play."
5,"I used to play with celluloid picks back in the 70's before they came out with Delrin. I like the sound and feel of these picks. They add a nice round sound that works well with jazz. and funk. They are a little expensive. but I think they are worth it if you need the sound and feel of the real thing.I bought the abalone ones because they look cool...***UPDATE***I am still using these picks but they tend to break along the colored lines. and usually during a performance. I have since gone back to Delrin and Nylon."
5,"I read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box & decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks & really wanted heavy picks & the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy & has the fender logo on it. but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick. sweep pick. tremelo pick. tap with the pick better. Also my pitch harmonics (better known as squealies) come out clearer to me. Overall the product is not an disappointment & im only using these pick (just in different colors) from now on ^.^"
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
5,"Simple. compact. well constructed. easy to use. and sounds good; all things you would look for in a capo.This is the original Shubb capo. designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings. The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make. each with their own specialized use. The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models. This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 (Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar. Heritage Cherry Sunburst). aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar. Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge. andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar. Vintage Sunburstelectrics. The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic.Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension. It's key to not get too much tension.We've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo. Mostly it goes in a pocket. Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck. it doesn't clamp tight on the headstock. Not a huge deal. but a consideration."
5,"Researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the Shubb.  This is a capo that while is not easily adjustable to slide up and down like other spring types. it's a great capo and very durable in construction and material.  Like a good guitar that is well cared for. this is something that's great to hand down to the next generation.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
5,"I love this guitar strap button. It's a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in. I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink. It works well for it's stated purpose and appears to be of high quality. The leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole. Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close."
5,"I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
5,"I compared this cable to the monster studio pro 1000 cable i also own. I prefer this more as i play live and it does a good job in handling noise snd also has a no questions asked lifetime warranty. Just take your broken cable to your local guitar center and they will replace it. I got 4 replacememts over 3 years. Worth the higher price because of the warranty. The 100 dollar studio pro doesnt do well live compared to this rock cable as the studio pro sucks up tone snd only sounds good for recording. note. this cable has high mid range so if thats what you like go for it"
5,"These cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut. I have several other 'good' cables but when compared to this they cut highs and even the level. I have grown as a musician to the point that I Know it's worth it to pay a little more for these quality cables. Yes you can get many cables way cheaper (and I'm all for getting things at a good price - publishers clearing house has Not visited me yet!) but this is a case of you get what you pay for!"
5,"My review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones. I bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars. The cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage.One complaint I have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my Spector bass securely. but works with the others flawlessly. I use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues.I also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables and Mogami and think that this one is worth it's price. To me. the warranty is worth it because of the price. I reead all over the web about the opinions of monster's patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality. but there are more expensive cables out there made by Mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion."
5,"This shelf is so convenient and so often used that you would think that it should come on every music stand. It just slips on to the lower shelf and creates a smaller shelf for pencils. pens. clip on tuners. capos. etc. It pays dividens in not cluttering up your book shelf so that items go spilling to the floor every time you adjust a book or turn a page. I love how a pen. capo. or tuner clipped to the top lip of the shelf serve to keep pages firmly in place until your book is &#34;trained&#34; to stay in place. A must have. five star item."
5,"quiet. almost hum free - clear respose - no volume control doesn't befront me because i use it to record & to play thru a PA where either I or someone else keeps the volume under control. It tends to be bass heavy. but a slight eq revisit more than compensates for that. I had used one in the past. this is a more solid unit & fits movement free in the soundhole of my guitar & also in two others i use here and there. great job. great value. got herre quick in a nice little carry bag & I will update if problems come later - don't see why or how tho"
5,"This is an excellent-sounding pickup.  I've had it for about six years.  Good sound throughout the spectrum - full lows and bright highs. without too much emphasis on either.  At the price it sells for. I consider it a bargain.The drawbacks:1) You need to be pay attention when installing and removing - you can damage the sound hole on your guitar if you're not careful.2) No volume control.If you're looking to occasionally amplify an acoustic guitar. this is a great. cost-effective way to go."
5,"I've used this on a variety of 6 strings and a few 12 strings and it really does give a good sound for the price. And if you've got a variety of acoustics and don't want to get pickups installed in ALL if them this is a great solution. It tends to work slightly better for finger picking than strumming because occasionally your hand will hit the chord coming out if you're not careful.Remember that it must be used with a preamp and hopefully something (most likely a tuner) with stomp on/off bypass so that you can turn it off more easily."
5,"I've used D'Addario strings for many. many years without problems - both acoustic & electric.  I've tried these coated strings in the past. and I actually prefer them to Elixir because they feel more like regular strings - the wrap is coated. rather than a sheathe being placed over the entire string. like on Elixirs.Do they last longer?  Probably.  Even when I'm in situations where I'm gigging regularly I rarely change strings more than every few months. just because I don't see the need.  I think the main benefit to coated strings is if you have guitars that you can't play regularly the strings won't corrode.  But these sound great and feel fine. and the're the least expensive coated strings I've found.  I've always found D'Addario quality to be great."
5,"But unless you are new to guitar. you know that. These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. Really. I can't tell that they do. Or that they don't. They sound great. and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Not sure if I would pay more for these in future. I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way.  Change the strings every couple of months. Just me at home so no big deal. if I were performing I would go through them faster.I'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings. 'Nuff said."
5,"These are great strings. They are the right length and go on easy enough. They are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren't color blind. They go on. sound bright. and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings. Had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever. you only have to change them every 3 months or so. I had to reply that forever just doesn't last as long as it used to. Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 1/3 less. that is a good deal even if they don't last forever. That means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book. Worth the extra pesos."
5,"I recently sent two of my Ovations back to the factory in Connecticut for re-work (I just plain wore them out). and they came back to me with these strings on them.  As soon as I took them out of their case and strummed them. I immediately called the factory and said 'thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars. and by the way. these are the best sounding strings I've ever played. what exactly are they?'  I might experiment with the EXP15s. but by and large. these EXPs are my new strings."
5,"Not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze? Not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze. The EXPs are nice strings. They have a nice feel to them along with less string noise. And they last. My two acoustic  guitars. a Takamine Mini jumbo and a Gretsch jumbo. both made from mahogany are both nice sounding guitars. I figured i would try these 80/20 strings after using phospher bronze. Only real problem i noticed is the 80/20s seem brighter and they ring longer. I prefer the warmer tone. And since my guitars have alot of 'boom' already. i dont need the extra ring to complicate the sound with overtones when strumming fast. I imagine these strings may work in some instances. but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars."
5,"While I love and trust D'Addario strings. i am subtracting one star because. I really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets.  For my acoustics. I do not always change out all the strings at once.  I think the bass strings get changed more when they start falling off on sound.Anyway. these are classic strings that I grew up with. but as I get more involved with playing. having the flexibility of individual envelopes for each string becomes more an d more appreciated.  Especially if you like to save your single strings for use."
5,"I had for years been using Elixir Strings on myWashburn D10simply because I was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch. I'm glad I tried out these D'Addario strings. These strings are an excellent complement to my Washburn. which has mellowed out over the years. They are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the Elixir strings. I can't speak to the manufacturers claim of '4 times more life.' but as of now. I'd have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money. Highly recommended."
5,"I like them. but these strings are probably not for everyone. The EXP16s do provide a crisp. bright sound almost leaning towards metallic. This tone is actually refreshing on my old shallow-bodied Ovation. However. I have to imagine that on a dreadnought or jumbo this sound might be quite different.While I was not expecting it. my favorite aspect of the EXP16s is the playability. The play is a little more elastic than I thought it would be. and they are amazingly easy on the fingers.The only downside that I experienced with the EXP16s is the fact that. while giving once on the guitar. they are a little brittle off the guitar (I almost snapped my E getting it set up). Other than that. the strings are just a little squeaky. I personally like a little squeak. but at the current price point. I don't think that it would be a deal breaker even for those who don't."
5,"I've long been partial to D'Addario strings--I don't have a guitar without them. These phosphor bronze models have found a home on my Epiphone flat-top.  As the package says. they're warm and bright--leaning just a little toward the brassy side.  They project without sounding harsh or tinny.  Playing feel is fairly smooth for round-wound strings and they last for ages.  This is a good intermediate gauge: light enough for lead work. but substantial enough to provide good backing.Guitarists tend to stay loyal to a maker and model of string.  My loyalty is certainly not shaken.  For any guitarist on another string whose loyalty might be wavering. these will reward an audition."
5,"I've been playing guitar for more than 20 years. I've played 6 strings. 12 strings. bass acoustics and electrics. When it comes to acoustic sound. these strings produce the brightest. clearest sound of any string I've ever used. Some strings have a 'bright' sound and some have a clear. distinct tone - not muted or dull. Still. other strings have a rich. full resonance that carries through a room. This is the only string I've ever used that has all of those qualities. In fact. the first time I put these on my acoustic and went to lead worship at my church. several of the church members commented that my guitar sounded 'better than usual' or 'really good' that day. I've tried some other brands since I found these and always end up coming back to them."
5,"These guitar strings sound about the same after a month of playing as they do right after I change them. I use to get a real kick out of changing strings because the new strings sounded so much different and better. but now the thrill is gone because these strings sound good for a couple of months although I change once a month anyway. I don't notice much difference at all though.But the best part is that these strings are over $17 bucks a set at my local music store and I get 'em for about $9.48 through Amazon's subscription service delivered to my mailbox every month with free shipping! Beat that!"
5,"One doesn't get much better than D'Addario strings.  In my opinion they're twice as clear as Martin strings and the EXPs just last forever.  I like the standard Phosphor Bronze just as well and use those as a less-expensive alternative.I certainly recommend D'Addario nylon strings on classical guitars.  I've heard no other string that has the crisp. clean. rich sound of this brand of strings.  I've used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand... but always come back to this one.Different diameter strings will sound significantly different. depending on the guitar you use.  I prefer this mid-range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone.  Any lighter and the guitar sounds 'tinny'. any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck.  These are 'just right'."
5,"I bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips.  I check the guitar in baggage with this case and it seems to protect it just fine.  the it is very good for a Stratocaster and there is a little extra room inside for tuner. picks. tuning forks. capo. etc.  and..........the price was very good.  best I could find for this time of hard case.  The only thing that is sort of weird is that most employees at the airport are constantly asking me if I have a gun in case.  If you need basic protection of your guitar. this will do very well.  I do not know if it will fit other guitars.  I have heard that some are too long for it.  but.......for the Fender stat. it works just great."
5,"I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. One was in the SKB Fender case ($99.95 on Amazon). the other in this Gator case purchased locally.  I was told it was just as good as the Fender case. Both ended up in checked luggage.  After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop. minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up.  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case.  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape. but after having the padding fall out. I just ordered another SKB Fender case.  The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips.  The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on."
5,"Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars.  The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar. and while the back support wouldn't scratch a guitar anyway. it's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate.  These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low.  This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked.  The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands. but overall this is excellent - I've replaced all my stands with these."
5,"I don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing. but they need to go back to engineering school. When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position. they're quite difficult to pop open. and once opened into place. you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off. because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.It'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place. and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. I just don't like the features of this stand at all."
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
5,"After trying out a few other styles and brands. I settled on this stand. wanting something that would keep my 50s Telecaster from taking an unexpected fall. The overall design of the stand is great. but I had to return my first stand. as there were severe quality issues with the finish. There were at least 3 spots where the black finish didn't stick to the metal. and I essentially had bare metal spots sticking out. The neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about 15 degrees to the right. once it was clamped down to the main stand body. Disappointingly. the replacement unit I received also has this issue. but only about 7-10 degrees worth. I'm going to use this stand in the meantime while I try to find something of a nicer finish. and truly worthy of my guitar."
5,"This is a good stand that can be used for both electric and acoustic guitars. The upper brace has an interesting way of securing the guitar neck making it unlikely your instrument will topple over. The stand can be used with or without the upper brace. On mine. the wheel that locks the upper brace in place is not as locking as I'd like it to be. Also. the &#34;feet&#34; don't spread as wide apart as I'd hoped. A few more inches would have been appreciated. All in all. a good but not &#34;perfect&#34; stand."
5,"I've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  This one is the worst.  The plastic screw (yes. plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to. is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.Secondly. there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6' pop filter.  If you don't. you'll wish you did."
5,"You may wat to reconsider buying ANY filter.On this model. the top (filter) part is essentially pantyhose wrapped around a cardboard tube.Despite this. the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good.In all honesty. Buy a nicer filter. or none at all. They do NOT make a huge difference on recording quality unless you're using Top-of-the-line microphones. If this is the case. spend the money to get a nicer filter.One nice thing- these keep artists from getting too close to the mic and essentially making out with them. I found that quality nice when dealing with... passionate vocalists."
5,"Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says 'Heavy Duty' which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip. but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly. and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead."
5,"I can't do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer (FOX).  If you haven't started in the mic-collecting business. trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below. you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one.  I've always wondered why I can't reproduce the sounds of our local NPR outlet. and I finally realize it's because they have the Shure SM7B and I don't.It enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives (face it. those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use).  It's very directional and 'selective' (rejecting room ambience and background noise). so it's perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications.  But for announcing. broadcasting. vocal performance and vocal recording. I don't see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it."
5,"I bought this compression pedal to give my leads a little extra oomph and it does just that. When playing hammer-ons and pull-offs. sometimes it can be difficult to get them to sound as loud as the rest of your picking. but not when using this pedal. It amplifies your quieter sounds and levels off the louder ones to give a smoothe sound. Works great if used correctly. Not to be used with dynamic picking sounds because you will lose that louder/softer sound.I use this with a Gibson Les Paul. and Washburn Hollowbody through a Fender Super Champ amp along with other pedals.  It can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion."
5,"I bought this pedal at a local shop and use it with both guitar and Bass. I usually put it before a distortion pedal and my original Phase 90. or use it as a standalone with an old amplifier to even out the signal. I do notice it is more effective with the guitar than bass. but that is typical. I usually do not turn the compression knob past 12 o'clock. but when using a chain of pedals. the compressor helps even out the lows and highs. The pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also. For the price. it seems like the best economical choice for compressor pedal out there and the MXR pedals are built like tanks. I have had this one and the Bass model for years and they hold up great while showing their age well."
5,"Its OK. the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank. i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can't complain about it not being worth what i paid for it. i currently have this on my pedal board along with a Digitech MainSqueeze which is less expensive. more adjustable and just more versatile. would i buy this. yes if i didn't try anything else first. nuff said."
5,"This is a great cymbal stand sturdy. tight. well made. using it with a 18&#34; crash and does not move or rattle. amazingly well constructed stand for the price. going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these. great product. I am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all. but it is a great stand for my studio/practice kit. Being honest don't know how it would be for a gigging drummer. but for what I am using it for. more than does the job."
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
5,"I have found this throne to be comfortable for studio use and it seems to be solid enough for everyday use.  It is sturdy and heavy enough for the average player and the price is definitely right.  The padding is just about right and feels good and comfortable for the session times for which I have used it.  I don't know how it would hold up for touring or constant use. but it is perfect for my needs. as I am a guitarist who plays drums for demos in the studio."
5,"This pedal works well. and lets you sculpt a pleasing sound to suit the situation.  A little goes a long way with the sliders. and the gain and level functions are occasionally useful.  Nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq.  It makes it much easier to dial in the exact sound you want. easier than messing with eq knobs that can interact with each other.Ten bands is a little overkill for guitar.  Three of them are outside the range of the instrument. but I bought this one because I like that it blinks if clipping. it has the extra volume and gain sliders. and comes with the AC adaptor.  This adds no noise that I can tell. except if the sliders are up it amplifies noise already there.It's an all around quality product that I imagine I'll still have twenty years from now."
5,"I ran across this thing a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  I'd been looking for a boom attachment for a non-boom stand because I play guitar and sing.  This seemed perfect. and it is.  Regular booms have always been a necessary evil. in my book.  They can be helpful. but also take up too much 'air space' on cramped stages or in small rehearsal spaces.  This thing gives you plenty of room to get the stand out of the way without making an annoyance of itself.  The other thing I like is that the elbow where it adjusts has teeth that interlock. so you're not just tightening a joint and relying on friction - as those are the kind of things that eventually fail once the tightening bolt gets tired.Anyway - no reservations about this one.  A dead-simple idea that works great."
5,"This is a tough unit. easy to set and locks tight.  The materials are robust.In a home studio there is never a lot of room and I didn't want a big boom hanging off the other side of my mic stand.  This fit the bill perfectly.  On the package there is an illustration of this being used at the end of a long boom to hang a mic in the perfect possition. and yeah. one could totally do that with this.This is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
5,"Well built.  The adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about 8 or 9 degree increments.  (10 possible positions between upright and horizontal)  Best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck. I'm using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the  stand to give  me a bit more room.  But there is no counter-weight here so its best used at shallow angles.  If I was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar. or if on-stage energy has you moving a lot more. I would opt for a boom stand instead."
5,"One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldn't handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly.  I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didn't have much to lose with a $7 price tag.  I was very glad I made the purchase and I'm going to order a couple more of this model and the 13' model.  It's steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place.  It's solidly built and I don't imagine it will break easily.  The two pieces that move against each other have teeth. so once the angle is set and the knob tightened. it will not slip.  Get the 13' if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand.  7' is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length."
5,"One thing I love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hi-hat stands. I use anOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneckto connect to the bar. then I attach either aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphoneor DM80 microphone. The bar-gooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model.This also works well for mounting on microphone stands. I use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the DM70 for tenor and alto saxophones. or a DM80 for baritones. Again. it works perfectly for my situations.I always keep a few of these. plus various size goosenecks. just in case I need to mount an additional microphone and I am short on stands. It's one more tool to make set up less stressful.Trust me. when you need one (and chances are you will if you're a drummer or a sound tech) you will thank yourself for having the foresight to purchase it for situations I cited above and those that I have not foreseen."
5,"Haven't had this long. but so far. it's just about perfect. I had bought another On-Stage side boom earlier and was greatly disappointed by its flimsiness (On-Stage MY550 - see review). This one on the other hand is rock solid and much more adjustable. AND only costs a few bucks more (fourteen buckos at present). I've got a 13' gooseneck and a light-ish condenser mic with a shock-mount on it. and it's as steady as can be. I'm convinced even heavier loads will be no problem. If you're in need of a side boom. look no further."
5,"Think it sounds like a trash can lid? No. it doesn't. It sounds like a crappy china which has it's place (in the rehersal studio for one...). Want a really good china? Spend more money. That's how it works. Great for practicing. Small diameter gives it a shrill overtone. Poor on recordings (unless you're looking for that... there's always an application). For $20 though. c'mon. What do you want? Anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad. It's $20. It was made in the remote hills of Wuhan China where they've been making cymbals of sorts for more than 3.500 years and you got one for $20. Or go buy a K Kustum and quit your sniveling. I say get one! get them all in all sizes and you still spent less than an actual professional china. boyah."
5,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal. the knobs feel sturdy. and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good. cheap choice. Personally. I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800.Joyo Vintage Overdrive.Deltalab TO-1.TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated. I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808. you may want to check this out first."
5,"I've had this pedal for about five years.  I own a bunch of other overdrive pedals. including the Boss SD-1. TS-9. a Klon clone. and a bunch of DIY pedals.  The Bad Monkey is cool for a couple of reasons.  First is the bass and treble controls.  Most overdrive pedals only have one tone control. the Bad Monkey lets you sculpt both the highs and lows.  Second is the mixer out.  Not everyone will appreciate this feature but it allows you to jack the pedal into a mixer or audio interface with a 'speaker sim'.The gain sound is ok. but what I do is use it as a boost by diming the output and turning the gain all the way down which slams my tube amp giving me a natural tube overdrive.  This pedal will work best with a tube amp but some people may dig the gain tone on a solid state.It's built like a tank.  Can't go wrong for the price. IMO."
5,"I love this pedal. I bought one used at GC the other day for $30 and never looked back. Before it I was using a Joyo Vintage OD that is also an excellent 808 Clone but this pedal is able to tweak the highs and lows better. I have it set so the level is set to 9:00. Low is set to 1:00. High is set to 9:00 and the Gain is set to next tuesday. I prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that. It also is a nice smooth OD not too crunchy.For a cheap 808 clone this is the best I have used hands down.Maxon 808 - $150Ibanez TS9 - $100Digitech Bad Monkey - $60Joyo Vintage OD - $50All great pedals for the money but not really sold that the Maxon is 2 1/2 times better."
5,"While I don't have a ton of experience with pedals. I really love this one. Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain. Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp. It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for. a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity. For the price I don't see how you can beat this pedal. I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome. No complaints with this outfit."
5,"I've tried to like this pedal. I really have.  Maybe it's my signal chain (?)  My experience with the DigiTech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar.  Sure. the OD is there. but it isn't worth losing your tone. is it?  Again. I reiterate maybe it's just me.  I have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now.  And the blue pedal isn't any different. either IMO.  Grunge was OK. but not my kind of style."
5,"Price:Very reasonable price for what they do.Comfort:These stay on your head very well and are comfortable. I have not noticed ear irritation yet.Noise reduction:These are absolutely stellar at noise reduction. These block so much sound. you no longer have to blast your music to hear over your drums. They also don't distort out side sound. Some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly.Sound quality:Crisp mid and high range. When it comes to the low end. these are lacking. And if you blast your music the low end distorts. But they block sound so well you don't have to blast them.Why not just buy in ear head phones. and over ear muffs?I have tried this many times due to not being able to find good head phones. It is very annoying. doesn't work very well. and looks pretty dumb too. These head phones are a much better solution."
5,"I got these for noise reduction. barking dogs. loud trucks etc. They work well for that. The only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head. After a time the pinch is bit much. I have a small (7-1/4) hat size too. However. the price was great. and the sound is good. I'm no audiophile. but do play guitar. mando and dulcimer. and for me these phones deliver a good. well rounded sound.One other thing. these headphones are made for the studio. not for outdoor use.So. if you can deal with the pinch. I highly recommend these headphones for noise reduction and sound quality."
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
5,"After going to various guitar/music stores and trying out many guitars (Yamaha.Ibanez. Fender and others) I researched on the internet and stumbled upon this make/model and saw the MANY positive reviews it had. I was reluctant to purchase an instrument without playing it first. so I purchased the best sounding guitar locally (costing me $129). After 1 day I realized I was unhappy with it still and took a chance and purchased this guitar online. The many reviews were absolutely correct. THIS guitar is wonderful and sounds great. I replaced the strings yet the original strings were just as good as the LIGHT strings I bought. Even though it is only an $89 guitar. I will treasure this one as if it was $300. Perfect intonation all the way up to the octave. Low action and stays in tune for days!"
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"This is a great guitar for the money. I paid $69.34 for my guitar and bought it through Amazon.com from Streamline Audio Video. It arrived ahead of schedule in great shape. ready to play right out of the box (after tuning it of course). If you want a better guitar than this. you will need to spend a whole lot more. The sound is great and it is easy to play. Only about 41&#34; long and may weigh a bit over the 6 lbs. stated in the description. My strings arrived is fine condition and the action was very close to what I will need."
5,"I didn't know what to expect given the price. but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money. I am impressed by the quality of materials. components. and construction. For example. the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed; they work smoothly. and firmly hold the strings in tune. The instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box; the action didn't seem inordinately high. but I couldn't resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so. and now the guitar plays even better. I might tinker some more at some point. probably when it comes time to replace the strings. but for now I am quite happy with the playability and sound of this full-bodied dreadnought. which is rich and resonant and very impressive. I still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price. but the proof is indisputably before me."
5,"I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter.  She is learning to play guitar and the classical guitar I gave her was just too wide for her little fingers to reach.  The action on this guitar is perfect and required no set up..was ready to go out of the box.  I almost kept it for myself as a knock around guitar it is that nice.  I have been playing for about 30 years and was really impressed with the quality of this guitar and the sweet. full. rich sound.  If you are looking at this guitar. buy it!  You will not be disappointed!"
5,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made. which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said. they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig. but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So. I recommend them. but be aware of its limitations."
5,"I had a Cannon brand clutch and I bought this one to replace it. What I like about this one is how the release lever works. On the Cannon the lever was vertical. This made actuating it a less natural motion. With this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases. That motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use. An argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but I have had no issue with it.Aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well."
5,"Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right. but now it works great.The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing. After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played.Height adjustment was also important. If the latch is to high. it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up. Too low and it does not sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs. so I am completely pleased with it.definitely worth $13.00"
5,"I've been interested in learning how to play the guitar for a long time. but the huge problem for me was finding something that was both affordable and made for smaller hands. as I'm rather petite.  Luckily for me. we found one of these secondhand (it needed minimal repairs)and it's just great.  I don't know anything about purchasing it new. but I can tell you that this is a great beginner's instrument for someone who has small hands.  I'll also note that it's even affordable while it's brand new.The notes are surprisingly clean-sounding coming from a guitar that's so low-priced. I'd definitely recommend this guitar to anyone who is interested in learning how to play but not interested enough to pay an arm and a leg for an instrument."
5,"The build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced (the cut is a rush job) and the neck needs to be reset (there's a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn't completely cleaned out when it was put on) - but what do you expect for this price. It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you're willing to invest another $50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a.young (smaller) player or a.nice travel instrument."
5,"Very playable right out of the Box and very beautiful. I have a Epiphone Swingster. Nighthawk and Violin Bass and they are all great products! I decided to give it a good set up. After the Strings were off I sanded down the Bridge 1-2 mm and adjusted the neck just a little. Then I want to really recommend Martin Bronze Strings light or extra light (green box) for an awesome sound and easy playability which is important on 12 Strings. Instructional videos can be viewed on YouTube before you go for it or you get a Guitar Tech to do it.Ps Matching Epiphone cases are available and so are inexpensive clip on pickups if you want to go thru an Amp or line in recording.Ps The Tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion. When you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner."
5,"If you're looking for a 12-string acoustic. then what more could you want than the Epiphone DR-212?  The craftsmanship is excellent. the sound is fantastic and it's easy to tune and play right out of the box.  Add the limited lifetime warranty and Gibson support and this guitar can't be beat.  The price is amazing for what you get. and to top this all off. it has been chosen as a Guitar Players Magazine Editors Pick.  You don't have this guitar?  What are you waiting for?  Order it now while the price is this low!  Go ahead! Go for it!  You won't be sorry..."
5,"I have an older version of this model. but it works great.  I opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that I got from Home depot.  2 hangers rated to hold up to 75 lbs each equals 150 lbs worth of peace of mind!  The hanger itself that I bought was used. so it was already assembled. so I can't comment too much on the assembly process.  I bought 2 of them. and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry-free security!  And no. I don't own stock in the company!  :-)"
5,"I actually have five of these for the various instruments. mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solid-body electric.When mounted properly to studs - the only way I have mounted these - they are very. very solid. While in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners. I used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength. You do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete. and to me a brass screw looks great with this &#34;flat black&#34; model.The CC11 model -- this one -- works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic. There are variants for other instruments. but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit. The yoke width is adjustable. and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder.Recommended...but do consider you means of mounting carefully."
5,"Easy to mount. solid grip on guitar. Only detractor would be that. with my guitar at least. it hangs kind of far from the wall. This obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though. An acoustic would clear the wall nicely. my solid body electric sits a few inches away from the wall.Silicone coating on forks and retaining bands get a good grip on the guitar. without marring even soft wood.I very much prefer this to having it on one of the 'accident waiting to happen' stands on the floor."
5,"The mounting process was simple.Recommendation:  Buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don't already have one.  You don't want your instrument plummeting to the floor!I got a stud finder off Amazon and mounted two of these hangers.  They're holding up very well. The backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall.  Whether that's a good thing...is up to you.  I guess I don't have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped.  So maybe it is a good thing.Be careful when you hang it though.  It could definitely hit the wall if you don't place it on the hanger carefully."
5,"Wanted to buy a better stand than the cheap metal folding one that I'd had in high school.  This was a great compromise between portability/storage and sturdiness.  I did want collapsible legs. which this has. and the solid coated metal shelf is wonderful after my old metal folding stand.  Works well with the Manhasset second shelf accessory. and has been in constant use for months now.  I've had absolutely no problems with it.  The height is easily adjustable. and the shelf tilt is easy too.  Am very happy with what I got for the price I paid!"
5,"CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again"
5,"These strings are okay. but nothing special except for the price. which is a factor when changing twice a week. I don't play enough to need changes that often anymore.So I've become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar. This doesn't mean that these strings are bad. it just means I might prefer Brand X Pure Nickel on one guitar because they're darker and Brand Y Steels on another because they're brighter and Brand Z on yet another.So give these a try and if you prefer them it will be best to check on price by the case of this or any string that you prefer because they should be changed twice a month at least. if you want your instrument in top shape. A bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good."
5,"Hey jerks. do you play guitar?  Well. if you do. you need strings.  Well. you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar.  If so. you can stop reading.  If you use strings. you should buy them your damn self.  While you're at it. buy ten sets.  Seriously. are you a child?  Always have extra strings.  D'Addarios last a long time for me. and they sound good.  Also. they're on the bottom end of the price range.  Buy some strings. douchnozzle."
5,"Keeping in mind the difference types of guitars and pickups. these D'Addario strings are good strings for all around use. They are suitable for rock. punk. country. and funk. Sure. you could spend more on 'boutique' specialty strings to give you that exact 'vintage' sound. but these strings are just fine whether you play in the bedroom. garage or club.I like the light guage .010's because they are easy on the fingers. but are still beefy sounding compared to thin sounding .009's and .008's."
5,"I have played on D'addario Before.  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok.  but can wear out real fast.  So. It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks. pinched hormonic's vibrato's. extreme bend's.  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings.I did try extra light (while they do soud nice.and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's.  cause beginer's tend to press hard. when they first stat out.Personally.  I don't like D'addario's at all.  I find the tone to bright."
5,"Not much to say. these are your basic hex core. nickel plated round wound strings.  They are the equivalent ofErnie Ball Slinkys (Yellow)They play nice. and feel pretty much the same in my humble (non-touring musician's) opinion.Also. it's nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer.  As a note these come packed together in a single bag. with color coded washers. (as opposed to the EB sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or DR sets that come two to a sleeve.)In summary. if you're searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren't reading this review. you're out experimenting.  For others. the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more."
5,"I've been playing for nearly ten years and I've used all sorts of strings on many different guitars. I've had ball ends pop off for no reason. ball ends rolling around in the bottoms of containers when I've bought them new. and a lot of unnecessary string breakage and fast corrosion. (all top brands) I have also overpaid for fancy gimmicks on strings that are supposed give you magic tones ect. Then I tried D'addario. they just work and work well. I'm not asking for anything magical I just need what I need when I need it and these string have never failed to deliver. I've been using them for over three years now I don't know why I didn't give them a shot sooner. I could have saved a lot of money trying them first. Bottom line is these strings do the job without any drama. giving me more time to just play!"
5,"This is my second order of the 10 pack. A local store wants 29.99 for one set of these. The feel is really good in my opinion as opposed to all the other brands I've tried; including. and especially the most commonly used eb's. I have however had a slight issue with certain D strings. On occasion. it looks as if the winding is chipping off. but not at the frets. I change strings quite often so it really doesn't matter. Not sure what that's about but it doesn't affect anything and like I said this IS my second order of these so I gave them 5 stars. Any less and I'd look dumb."
5,"For a good. basic set of regular light gauge electric guitar strings. it's difficult to go wrong with D'Addario's EXL110s.  The range of thicknesses generally works well. and D'Addarios tend to be pretty consistent.  Some other brands may offer special features that go beyond what you get with the EXL110s (e.g. coating. super brightness. and so on). and some players prefer a slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string (e.g. sets that start with 9s or 11s). but for most purposes these work great. hold their tuning well. and seem to last pretty well. too."
5,"The D'Addario sets are good stuff. I got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker. The color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran. With stretching. they stay in tune fine. The unknown truth about non-nylon strings (and maybe even them. too) is that there are only a handful of string makers. and D'Addario actually makes them for other companies (Gore uses them for their Elixir series. and just adds the polyweb coating). I also use the GHS standard .010 sets. and they are good too. My faves are the Ernie Ball sets. but they rarely go on sale. I don't remember who makes what strings for what companies. though. With offshore production a standard thing now. it's no telling where they actually come from anyways. I DOUBT that GFS strings are domestic production. for instance."
5,"These strings are good. Nice tone. last a decent amount of time. and they're cheap. Color coded ball-ends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention. I use these on all my electric guitars now. where before I used Dean Markley 11-52 (mostly Les Paul scale) - I moved to these when I got a strat-scale guitar. I don't remember why I picked these. other than they are cheap and readily available everywhere. where Dean Markley can be hit or miss."
5,"These strings aren't for everyone. and probably not what you want for everyday. normal playing. But if you're looking for a fast-playing string with a bright sound. this is the string. In addition to putting them on my guitar. I also have a six-string banjo (guitar tuning) and just couldn't get the sound I wanted from regular guitar strings. Light guage nickel strings were recommended to me. and they were exactly what I was looking for. They have a clear. bright sound that great for picking and strumming. I play a lot of bluegrass and Irish music. and I feel these strings are ideal for that purpose. I use a lot of D'Addario strings on my various instruments. and I think they offer the most bang-for-the-buck in terms of quality and tone. You can pay more. but I don't think you get that much more. Although these were intended for electric guitar. they also work well on resonator guitars."
5,"D'Addario Are The Best Strings That I Have Tried. I Used To Use Ernie Ball Super Slinky's But Found That These Last Longer. The Ernie's Bend and Play Well But They Tend To  Go Dull Faster Not To Mention The Ernie's Start Corroding Within A Week. These D'Addario Strings Stay Brighter Longer. I Usually Change Them About Every 4 Weeks. The Ernie's Only Last Me A Week. 2 Weeks At The Most. That Can Get Expensive Fast. All Around The D'Addario Strings Are The Strings 4 Me. Retraction. when I originally wrote this review I thought they were the best. Turns out they are in fact way better than Ernie Ball Strings. but they are no longer my preference. A friend of mine told me about DR strings and they are much better than these D'Addarios. DR's last three times as long as D'Addario. the DR's cost a lil more but they are way better. for the money Addarios are good but I would recommend spending a few dollars more for DR strings"
5,"To be clear: I am quite the newbie guitar player.After i managed to break a string on my electric guitar. i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself. as most guitarists do. Things went alright. but on trying to tune the thinnest string. it broke. I just figured it was something I did. and wasn't the products fault. so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine. Overall. i've played quite abit with these strings. and have yet to break another one. Pretty good sound quality. and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture-resistant package to prevent corrosion."
5,"These D'Addario  strings are great!  I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using. these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life.  Intonation is good and I've noticed less breakage as well.These strings are a bit bright but have plenty of 'good' sparkle too and really sound good on my Strat. even more so than my Sheraton.  Being from the 'old school' I still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper. but what can ya do? Besides that. I am totally stoked and happy with these.  I think I might try 9's on the Sheraton but even as is they play (and sound) very good."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
5,"If you're a Froosh fan like me. than look no further. These are the strings used by John Frusciante (formerly of the Red Hot Chili Peppers). These strings really are special. They help nail his tone and are slick. light. feel and handle bends perfectly. I use these on my 1962 Strat Reissue and they really compliment the stratocaster well. Highly recommended for those playing blues/funk/rock.Plus. I mean. come on. John mother *&%$#$% Frusciante uses them! :p"
5,"I have been a faithful user of D'Addario strings since a well meaning obsession-starter recommended them to me at a local music store.  Compared to other brands of nickel strings that I've used. these ones just feel 'cleaner' than the others. They have a clearer sound. and seem to hold their tune better than most.If you're looking for acoustic strings. you can't beat the phosphorus bronze for warmth and clarity.  But if you're looking for electrics that are reasonably priced and sound clean. look no further."
5,"As stated. I use the D'Addario 9s and 10s on all my electric guitars except for theGibson LP's and I use Brite wires on those.I like the D'Addario's over the Brite wires because they have color coded balls and thismakes changing out all the strings at once a lot easier.I do not produce a lot of body acid. so strings last a very long time with me. no matterwho the manufacturer is. and I play many guitars in my collection so none of them gets heavyuse.The EXL strings produce great tone. and are great for bending."
5,"I've been playing for 8 years and I own 4 electric guitars.  All of my guitars are strung with D'Addario 10's.  They sound great when they're fresh and in my opinion they stay fresh the longest.  I play at least 15-20 hours per week so I put a decent amount of wear and tear on my strings.  It's really the durability that sets these apart.The Amazon price is terrific.  I like to restring my main guitar a little bit more than once a month and I can buy a year's worth of these for the same price as 1 set of bass strings.  I'd definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through Amazon."
5,"I have an Epiphone Dot and I installed a Bigsby V5 on it.  I could not find a gig bag for semi hollow body guitar so settled on this one due to the price.  And a previous reviewer said his Dot with Bigsby fits.  Well it fits. but just barely.  The guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case.  I have to turn the arm of the Bigsby around. facing down. to close the case.  I think the case probably pushes the arm down a little bit even in this position.  I probably wouldn't store my guitar in this case for long periods cuz I'd worry about tension on the strings.  Otherwise I like it."
5,"The shell and the lining of the case are perfect: hard on the outside. and soft on the inside.I opened up the box and my Epiphone Dot slid right in.The only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap. and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen.I'm not traveling around with my guitar too much. so that's not a problem for me. but I would worry a bit if I were checking it on an airline.Otherwise. it works perfectly for what I bought it for - protecting it in my mancave / basement from dings and scratches."
5,"I got this for my Epi Sheraton II:PROS:  It fits perfectly; it's 'fur' lined and has a decent sized internal compartment; it's solid and the hardware is sturdy; it has one locking latch (out of five). but nothing that would stop a real thief; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over. two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side. and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground; it's relatively thin.CONS:  It's heavy; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle; it has some 'Made in China' characteristics.I've had several cases and this is one of the nicest.  On a personal level. I'd prefer it didn't say 'Epiphone' on the outside.  But since it does it's a good place to hide a $3000 Gibson 335."
5,"The M48 is well built. sturdy and well balanced enough that I have no concerns about tipping. even when it is loaded with several music books and a folder of sheet music. The tray is wide with an appropriately sized lip. and is moveable up and down with a moderate effort. Once in place it stays there with no slipping. For all of the solid construction it does not feel heavy and it is easy to move around. although it would be a little awkward to transport it in a small car.This is one of those purchases where there are a number of alternatives. and I always have some concern that it will not be what I want when I get it... in this case it is a winner. Delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
5,"I'll keep this short and simple. I do alot of radio work. and saw the price of this mic of eBay (I wanted to use Paypal) and got it. 60 bucks for something I'd have easily have paid 100+ for. and with the included shockmount. it's a total steal. This obviously won't match top quality condensers. but for speech atleast. I find it to have a wonderful crisp tone with a warm sound to compliment your voice. It just has that smooth radio sound you hear on stations like NPR. which I just love. It sounds fantastic and with a proper interface. possibly the best condenser I've tested that's under 150 bucks."
5,"I love this product. It came fast. included extra shockmount line. shockmount. an adapter. the mic. instructions. and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting. The sound quality is great with the Art Tube Preamp(use mic cables. not 1/4' cables for Phantom Power). and I couldn't be happier with it. It even looks impressive. Although. I do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny. when in reality it is this 'off-silver' color. Almost a gold. but not quite. It's not bad or anything. just different. And frankly. the thing could be purple for all I care- as long as it produces great sound. that's all that matters. Great product. and extremely affordable. No complaints."
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
5,"I have a few Planet Waves products and I can safely recommend them.  This is no different. it works. I have no issues with the product. if you are looking for a peg winder.  or any accessory. I'd recommend you look at Planet Waves among your research in brands.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
5,"I picked up one of these at Guitar Center a while back.  At first. it seemed unstable. but then I tried to open it up a little more. and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here.  When it's opened up all the way. it is relatively stable. and is suitable for servicing your own guitar.  As others say. it does fold up nicely. and takes up minimal space in my toolbox.  I wouldn't use this if I made a living servicing guitars. as I don't think it would last long due to the quality of materials (it does feel pretty cheap.)  But it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while.I imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt.  Over all. I'm happy with the purchase. as it suits my needs."
5,"I do all my own guitar maintenance. which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings. etc.  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose. but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench.  So. looking around on Amazon. I found this handy little device.  It's small. works well. and fairly inexpensive.  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust.  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction.  But don't get me wrong. it's still pretty strong... just don't put too much weight on it while using it."
5,"This little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work. It folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases. The rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table. It may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you're not careful. Sure. a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose. but what else would you spend the $10 on?"
5,"I started playing mandolin back in September and bought a lot of different picks to try to find the type that would work best for my playing. and finally decided on the Dunlop Jazz Stubby 3.00mm picks.  Once I determined that it was the best pick for me it was an easy decision to buy a package of them so that I won't ever be without one.  Picks have a habit of disappearing just when you need them most -- buying them in bulk this way means that I'll always have them available and can even share them with others if the opportunity arises."
5,"Works great for my acoustic dreadnought.If I had any complaint it would be that there's nothing to prevent the lower part of the guitar from banging against the wall. It would be nice if they had an option for something that could hang down off the hanger - a little cushion - that would go between the wall and the guitar. No reason I can't make something like that on my own. though.Edit - 9/24/2013 - Just got my first classical guitar and realized that the wider neck won't fit into this hanger. Nothing worth complaining about. but just something to note - if you need a hanger for a classical guitar. this isn't it."
5,"This is a really nice item and I got two of them.  Unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and I had to force it which has created a little wobble.  That's the problem with mail order. Sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it. Oh well so far its working OK with the my old classical (beater) guitar I have hanging on the faulty one.  The other unit seems to be rock solid. Oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar."
5,"This Guitar Hanger is good looking. well made. and was exactly what we were looking for to hang my son's acoustic guitar on the wall in his room. Our logic was that having it hanging in plain sight would be much more conducive to him practicing over having it hidden in case stuffed in a closet. and so far that seems to be the case.The hanger was easy to install (literally took less than 5 minutes to screw into the wall) and is easy to use (just place guitar in the padded holder by the neck).Highly Recommended!CFH"
5,"Works great.  I didn't use the monster size wall board screw and it holds fine with the small furnished screws.  Next time I'm buying the all metal one and daisy chaining them to a board so I don't have to make tons of holes in the wall for my half dozen guitars.  For now I'm hanging one on the wall with this and it's fine.  Wood is nice quality.  I notice the price is almost 2x as much if you walk in the guitar center."
5,"Many reviews cover the pro's of this item. so I'll be short only to add that they are very sturdy (when install properly...suggestion:  find a wall stud and use 3' screws for heavier instruments).Used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 Strat's.  Haven't had an issue with any in the 4-5 months we've had them up.  On the electrics. we use the section of the bracket between the wall and the hook to hang the coiled guitar cable.The hooks are bendable and can adjust or adapt to virtually any style head and are grippy enough to keep slick finishes from slipping.Wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free."
5,"Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas. but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks. depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance. I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood. really - to support the instrument from the bottom. The top hanger now just serves as a rest. but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward."
5,"With musical instruments standing about on my office floor. I determined to find a better way to keep them available. and so I decided to hang them on the walls. This hanger was very easy to install. It comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to drywall itself. or through drywall and into wall studs. I used the pre-drilled holes as a template to mark my wall and the hanger went in easily. But a word of warning: use a level to align the hanger to a vertical position on your wall. If you don't. your guitar will hang a bit cock-eyed."
5,"I have 7 guitars in my cramped little bedroom studio and I quickly ran out of space to hold them easily. Floor space is dominated by my desk and drum set and I wanted my guitars to be out of the way and safe so they didn't get tripped over or dinged. Enter the String swing.I have 7 of them and I have hung everything from a Fender bass to a takamine acoustic with no trouble.The Y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a Stratocaster. Just slip your headstock into it and the weight of the guitar finds it's own center of gravity.The base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory. I didn't use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs.These are well worth the cost."
5,"This is a lovely wall mount for your guitar. Comes with everything you need (except a drill or a screwdriver of course). It is pretty and very strong. I originally purchased it to hang on drywall (sheetrock) for my 5 year old's mini guitar but once I had it mounted I found that it is strong enough to hold MY ELECTRIC guitar. which is quite heavy and that is amazing to me because usually that kind of weight would pull a mount right out of the sheetrock. This is a good buy."
5,"I have 10 of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars. banjos. and mandolins.They attach to the wall with 2 screws.  Hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall.  It takes about a 1/4 inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic.The piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone/rubber which protects the instrument.  The holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have.I have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again.Very sturdy. well made product."
5,"I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did. I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick. its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement. I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on."
5,"This is an OK solution to keeping your picks handy and organized; at least you can have one place where you can find a pick. as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case. but a small baggie will work just as well. Maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage? Sometimes (depending on the amount and size of the pick) it's hard to get the pick out of the holder. and if you use something other than the standard shape. forget it.  It has an adhesive backing. so I guess you can stick it on your amp/guitar/wall/small animal. but I'd rather not."
5,"This Dunlop 'Ergo Pickholder' is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy. especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick. you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.RecommendedCFH"
5,"I love this little item.  I was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new Fender but I love it.  No more hunting for picks anymore.  When I am through playing a just slide my pick back into the holder and it's always there when I pick up the guitar.Placement is everything though so think it out before you just stick in on your guitar.  I placed mine where I'd never rub against it. between the amp cord inlet and a control knob.  Make sure it isn't in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against it.I love this and have one coming for my acoustic too. only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitar.Oh. I use medium picks and fit 7 easily into the holder and wouldn't try to squeeze another on in. but that's why you have a gig bag anyway.  This is a must have item. in my opinion."
5,"It didn't seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless. It may work well with Dunlop picks but not for thePlanet Waves 10 Standard Guitar Picks - Duralin Blue ###GT!!! Medium/Heavy. also the thicker the pick. the fewer it will hold. It has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot. I've found it mostly not useful thus far. maybe it would help more when playing live so I can grab for a pick and know they will be there."
5,"I hated having to put the pick between strings.  And now that I have a ton of picks. I can convientently put them in this little thing that attaches to the guitar.  Im still weary of putting it on my guitar because it has a matte finish. and I dont want to ruin it.  But the instructions say it should be fine.  I think I might put it on my amplifier instead because having it on the guitar might get in the way as well. still deciding on that.  But for the price you pay for this. it's a no brainer for any musician."
5,"I can't compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder I use. I have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar I own. And every student I've ever had. has one on their guitar as well. They are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding. They stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time. they can be easily removed and relocated. After relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location. I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others. No matter how many picks you store. or for how long. the spring action loader never loses its resistance. I highly recommend these. I personally will never even try any others as I am so pleased with this product. If you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks. this is the product for you."
5,"The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument."
5,"A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I've never had cause to remove it. At first I thought I'd hate the look of it there. but it's never bothered me one bit. Reaching for pics is never a problem. I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics. This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal."
5,"I've used several different kinds of guitar cables. and I've finally settled on planet waves cables. From patch cables to guitar cables. I simply trust this company. In most cases the difference between guitar cables is the same difference between an iPhone and an Android. there really isn't one - it simply comes down to user prefrence. So in that regard. I prefer planet waves cables. I snagged this cable so I had the one right angle for my pedal board and the other end for my guitar. Highly recommended!"
5,"Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats. and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality. since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10'. 1/4' mono (tip)"
5,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive. yet lightweight. flexible. and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness. which feels nice at first and feels 'more studio.' but when you're actually using the cable. it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance. Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more. I prefer Pro Co Excellines. since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler. just call Sweetwater). which feels nicer to me. but I like these just fine."
5,"I got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is NO CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world....after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course . since this cord is molded/sealed up tight . it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead..."
5,"I've used so many guitar cables over the years that I lost count. It's hard to find a tough. low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere. but this one is the best one out there for the price paid. Its made well. with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that I love. I use it for all of my equipment connections. and it simply works with no problems and no noise that I could detect. Try it out. you'll discover the same as me and my band mate's have. that this is the best cable for the money on Amazon!"
5,"I haven't measured signal throughput so I can't comment on that.  But where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle.  This thing simply will not crimp. will not kink up on itself. does not get twisted and has no tension in it.  It's the easiest handling cable I've ever dealt with. a real pleasure when you've got all kinds of wires running all over.  It's like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy. and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connections.I have a 10-footer with one right-angle connection. and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a Telecaster."
5,"Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks.  Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago.  Last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. Messed around a bit and it started to work.  Today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp.  Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy.  Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either.  At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $12 cord.Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I'd return it.  Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund.  Will just move on to another company's cord."
5,"I was originally was about to purchase a cheaper. thinner cable. but settled on this Planet Waves Classic series XLR cable. I wanted myMXL 2010 Multi-pattern Studio Micto have a quality xlr cable connecting it. I also have my microphone and this cable connected to theYamaha Audiogram 6 audio interfaceand it works flawlessly.* Sturdy cable. IT is thick and flexible at the same time. It curls around my microphone stand well. too.* Good connector heads. At the female end (microphone). there is spring part that locks in the microphone in. NIce added peace of mind.This cable simply feels strong and well made. Phantom power and data transfer has been flawless. I highly recommend this quality XLR cable.Update: 12.19.12Still working great after 5 months. Forgot to mention the nice packaging. It's eco friendly and nicely packaged. It also has a lifetime GUARANTEE. Not a warranty. a guarantee! That speaks volumes on the quality they believe on their product."
5,"These picks seem well made and have a solid feel. but I'm not sure I like the sound of them.  Like so many other guitarists. I go through a lot of picks. searching for what feels and sounds the best for what I do.  I don't this is it for me--at least not on acoustic.  Whatever I didn't like about them got drowned out when I tried electric.  Since I've been playing more acoustic lately. I might or might not buy these again."
5,"Dava picks are one of life's guilty little pleasures. They may seem pricey for picks. but they're still not that expensive. I bought this batch of picks when I realized my Davas from three years back were all gone.I use these to play slide. I also have Fender and Musician's Friend picks. but those are just the standard flat stamped-out pieces of plastic. The Davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control. And they just plain feel good to use. The other picks have more of a tendency to slip and slide. but with Dava you get a great grip."
5,"I usually use Dunlop big stubby 2.0 picks. I used the Master Control Pick for the first time today. and I just had to order two more. because they're so amazing!! The attack is second to none!! At first the pick felt a bit strange as I'm accustomed to the thicker Dunlop. and I have to admit that initially I was a bit weary of the notably thinner Dava; but in no way has my playing been hindered. if anything it just seems to run along the strings effortlessly. and by far these are the most comfortable picks I've ever used!! What a find!!UPDATE 6/6/14:Still the best pick I've ever played. If you're worried about the metal tip of the pick breaking or weakening the strings. don't worry. they won't (at least not from what I've seen). Also. pinch harmonics are the easiest thing in the world to play with these picks!"
5,"I bought two of these straps from a local store for thirty bucks each about two years ago. They've been the best straps; along with the same straps without the grommets. that I've used. I figured I'd save a bit and get a couple more from Amazon. I got them fast and saved twenty bucks. They do fine with my fairly heavy Fender and St Blues guitars as well as my P bass. They are middle of the road for price and width. but give me no comfort issues at all. My second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets. Super tight and easy to lower. Raising it is a different story though. I just save the fast &#34;lower played&#34; songs for last. Those are the best ones anyway. Excellent strap."
5,"This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first. it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)"
5,"nice sturdy construction for the most part. although I don't like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends. But for the price. you get what you pay for. I would have much better liked it if they were metal. I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good. but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead. The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar. so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position. the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back. I'll give it a try for a while. but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare."
5,"I bought this for an accousic guitar. then I had to have one for a mandolin. and now I also have one for a square-neck dobro.  Some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don't leave much room for a leather strap.  Some case manufacturers have the same problem.  This item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it. that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job.  Same with the mandolin. if you want a wider strap. The dobro had the issue with the strap didn't have a great connector."
5,"If you're a bass player and use a pick. you need one of these. If you are a bass player and *sometimes* use a pick. you *really* need one of these! I bought one for every bass and a spare.Wedgies work better on bass than guitar. because the strings are thicker and usually parallel. I have a guitar wedgie on my gibson explorer. and it is a bit loose because of the angled headstock spreading the strings--but the bass ones stay put.Really. these things are great."
5,"After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more. I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way. if a longer unit is needed. I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware. very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front. using an SM 57. and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy."
5,"I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)"
5,"I use this when myOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck. Blackare too long for what I want to do. Sometimes - on rare occasions - I have used this to extend the length of the 13' model.The mic I mainly use this with is aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphone. which is small. relatively light. and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals. When I am using that mic for alto and tenor sax. I use anOn Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment Barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand. and attach the gooseneck and DM70 without using a separate mic stand.Because this and its bigger sibling are so versatile I keep a few of each size around. plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars. In some situations they can be a savior during set up.  I will empahsize. though. that anything larger than the DM70 or DM80 (which is slightly larger and heavier). and this may not hold your mic in place."
5,"I have several MXR pedals. Every one is superb--except for this PHASE 90 (the non-'script' version reviewed here). This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean. for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion. a swoosh of sonic dirt. I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (Look up 'MXR Phase 90 Mods.' and 'Erik's Corner' will show you how.) I made the 'R28.' 'C11.' and 'C12' modifications. The result: a slightly improved phaser. one that still churned out plenty of distortion. Finally. I tried adjusting the internal trim pot. On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. No luck. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESN'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION. AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90."
5,"I do not have much to say about this. It does what it was designed to do and it looks fine.I found myself actually trying to see if it will rip. for the purposes of this review. Just so I could make some sort of comment about it... You can rip it if you try. but it's not likely to happen during everyday use.It's fairly thick. If that isn't what you want then I would look elsewhere. This should be fine for nearly everyone who doesn't have a very specific reason for a different sort of windscreen."
5,"At first I thought this would be a gimmick. but it was cheap so I figured what the hell. Once I had it. however. I realized how invaluable it was. When performing live. I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic. Once I got this little guy though. I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times. Volume remains constant. white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear. It also protected my mic in a fall once too. Can find anything better for this cheap."
5,"These are by far the best value for effects pedal cables.  I find the local music stores won't stock them. forcing you to buy higher quality cables at about $7.00 each.  These cables. so far. have done the job at a fraction of the price.  We will see how well they stand up over the long-term as they are a cheaper cable.  But for the price. they are great.  At 6 per pack. you can even afford to simply replace them as they go bad and still be ahead -- if that even happens."
5,"Bought this on a whim.  It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion.  When used with a pedalboard rig. it doesn't add much except for hiss. unfortunately.  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit. though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment. Line 6 equipment. Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar. amp. wah. and guitar. or amp. wah. guitar. and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out. though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player. but good for beginners and intermediate levels.  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling."
5,"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz. distorions. auto wah. a compressor. octaver. bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to 'recuperate' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity. definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"
5,"I have had several MXR pedals through the years ... I have always found their quality to be very good for the price ... in fact. some of their pedals exceed the competitors' products for less than half the price ... (to each his own and certainly there are higher levels of quality out there but just because it is priced more doesn't mean it is that much better)If you need a little tone sweetener. this pedal can deliver ... with flatter EQ's it is fairly noiseless ... but as with all EQ's. if you boost certain frequencies pretty high. you will get some noise ...Simple to use and I particularly like the lighted LEDs for each band ... this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage ...As with all MXR pedals. it is built solid and road-rugged ...For the price. this is a nice pedal. simple to use and built to last"
5,"I didn't want to spend too much $$ for a guitar that I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. There were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price. They were good quality and if this didn't work out then I would have probably gone that route. To my surprise. this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar. The only downfall was that the frets were sharp on the one side of the guitar. The local shop only charged me $5 to shave them down. I replaced the strings right away. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it. Definitely worth the price you pay."
5,"This guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well. I am now a fan of Takamine. Their is nothing bad I can say about this guitar and I would take this guitar anywhere. This is my 4th guitar I have bought and is by far my favorite guitar. I have 2 electric guitars and now 2 acoustic. this being the second acoustic. I wanted a cheap guitar I could take anywhere and not have to worry about it being scratched up. except I got the guitar and looks too nice to let get beat up. People are complaining about the guitar not having a glossy finish. It wasn't supposed to be glossy to give it a richer look. If this guitar was glossy it wouldn't be as nice sounds stupid but it is true. You have to see the guitar face to face to understand what I mean. This guitar I would recommend to anyone. I am trying to get my friends to buy one so can all have a acoustic guitar. lol. Thank You!!!!!!"
5,"I don't own one. but have been playing my sister-in-law's for the last year when visiting. Didn't know much about the guitar. but was quite impressed by the sound and workmanship. Changed the strings. and. other than the action being a little high. it's as good as anything I've played for under $500. I honestly thought it cost around $350. so I was quite surprised seeing it for sale for less than $100. It's definitely a great value.In part because of my experience with this guitar. I purchased a Takamine G Series 12-string last year. (for considerably more money). and it's simply incredible."
5,"I bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon. I wasn't planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar. The way the military palletizes all of its cargo. I figured there was about a fifty percent chance it would arrive in a flattened box with wooden splinters sticking out of it. but I took the chance anyway. It arrived intact. and ready to play. The strings are a bit cheap. but the guitar itself is well made. and has a really nice rich tone. I was planning on giving it away when I left. but I am shipping it home instead. and it wioll cost me almost the price of the guitar to mail it home. but it is worth it. This one has worked out so well I am taking a chance on a 12 string. soon to arrive in Theater."
5,"I got tired of flying with my guitar everytime I go visit my parents.  Besides the risk to my guitar. there is the cost.  For the price I paid for this guitar. I will be money ahead in two visits to my parents.  I had it shipped to my parents when I bought it. and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits.  It has much better tone than I expected. and very good action.  Stays in tune very well.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party."
5,"well.. First of all. I am a beginner.. I do not know anything about guitar... I saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets... Mine came yesterday and I am afraid that it would have issue. so I brought it to school and let my professor checked for me.. It surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all.. The string does not corroded. but I changed mine anyway. The fret does not have any issue at all.. and the Truss rod adjustment is perfect.. The action is low and the guitar structure is perfect. When my professor starts playing it. he was surprised by the sound it produced. He thought the guitar cost $300 above!!... He also bought one this morning...haha...anyways. I buy it from amazon and the packaging is great!!...My guitar comes in a perfect condition. and I strongly recommended this guitar for anybody!!..."
5,"I tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars.  Therefore. after playing. I always wipe down my strings to extend their life.  I've used other microfiber cloths. but they tend to break easy and leave 'fuzzies' on the strings. which I then have to remove one by one.  This cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use.  It is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use.  I liked my first one so much. that I am putting in another order."
5,"Purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me. This cloth cleans up pretty well. but what i noticed after wiping down the strings a few times is that the fibers would hook. I dunno if they weren't meant to wipe the strings with but my ernie ball cloth is A LOT more durable than this cloth. They do the job but i believe that the ernie ball cloth does it better. Like a previous reviewer. i'm a little iffy about putting this cloth in the washer.Update: Putting it in the watcher was fine and idk why but after washing it for the first time it cleans up 1000000x better than before. i like this and my ernie ball cloth :)From 3 to 5 starts!!"
5,"I bought my first one from Amazon over a month ago - and simply fell in love with it.  It cleans/polishes wood. metal (although for strings. I use GHS' Fast Fret). eye-glasses. computer screens. etc with wonderful ability. easily replacing 'casual' cleaning/polishing fluids.  I even recently bought a 2nd just because.  And yes. the first one has finally gone through the wash after a month of constant use- I knew it was time when it wasn't wiping off the smudges as quickly.  It came out with a slightly nappy texture (to be expected really). but still works as well as ever.  There is a vast amount of different 'polish' cloth brands out there. but you won't go wrong with this one."
5,"We've all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job. When I see the word microfiber I always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck.This cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing I've tried before. With no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it.This would be great for Any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions.Reasonably priced too."
5,"This is a great-sounding reverb pedal. Tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound. I've combined this with a Epiphone Sheraton II (semi-hollow body) and have been able to get some awesome deep. rich sounds (watch out for feedback though). The design is very solid. and the controls are quite easy to use. Honestly. I think it has a lot of reverb settings that I won't use very much. but there's no problem with them being there.I definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of Kings of Leon. U2. etc. Or if you're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones. this is it. This has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar. My only caveat to this review is that I haven't tried out other reverb pedals. but this one definitely suits all my needs."
5,"As soon as I got this pedal I put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum. I have a 2 Behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals.but my pedal board was silent till I put this pedal on it. I've only had it for a few days. but the cons out way the pros. Maybe I will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit. Once I get around to playing with it I will write another review."
5,"I've been a gigging musician for almost 20 years. and this is the most well made. most comfortable guitar/bass strap I've ever used.Pros:- Substantial padding where you need it- Perfect stitching- Heavy. stiff leather ends- Soft. fine-woven material - not the coarse nylon you find in most cheap straps- Underside is lined with an even softer material - makes the strap comfortable even without a shirt on- Did I mention it's super comfortable?Cons:- None to speak of.  Seriously.  It's that phenomenal.Perfect whether you're rocking a featherweight Strat or a 16-pound 6-string bass.I use it with a 13-pound 5-string Warwick bass. and it makes it feel like the bass is a part of me.  I hardly notice I'm actually wearing it.Combine this strap with a decent set of strap locks. and it could easily last you 10 years.You will not be sorry with this purchase."
5,"Bought one. tried it on a P-bass. loved it.  Returned to Amazon and bought an additional one for a Jazz Bass...love it.  Good product for a good price. very comfortable.  Update:  I just ordered my 3rd one of these. this time for another P-bass I picked up.  The only gripe I can think of (and it's being super picky) is as another review mentioned the strap's padding design doesn't really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position.  If you're a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap. other than that. this is a killer product for a killer price."
5,"It's not fancy. but it's well though out. and you can't beat the value. The edges don't cut your neck. and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want. Like others. I had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment. The foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want. and it flexible/thin enough to go through the buckles if needed. Excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass."
5,"If you need it. good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap.  Leather or simulated. this was quite adequate for my purposes.  Price was right! Delivery was immediate.  Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case.  This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument. since it comes in at least two distinct color tones.Planet Waves Mandolin Strap. Brown.  Also comes in Black. There is also an embossed model (Brown) offered at minimumly higher price."
5,"isn't it sad when somebody produces a great product but screws up on the description? The product is great value for money and worth while buying. if for no other reason than save money on overpriced DC power units from the manufacturers of the pedal units. Trouble is that they do not say whether or not the cables come with the unit. They don't!! Dumb of them. as all they needed to say  was you needed to buy them separately. which I later did. Seems like nit picking? Well. it's not as live abroad and these things take a long while to come down to me. Sloppy isn't it?"
5,"It works great for five of my lower power pedal type items. including my Line 6 wireless receivers. Shure wireless receivers. and several other pedals like my Cry Baby. etc.. all at once.  However. the transmitter for my Shure wireless in-ear monitor. which requires less power than any of the other two items combined. will not run. even by itself. when powered by the 1 Spot.  Switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own. and there is probably some little quirk in the Shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn't get along with.  For most of my stuff it works great. and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords."
5,"I use this One Spot Adapter with the 5 pedal attachment. Works perfectly! I've seen reviews about this brand being noisy. I suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version. Too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle.I've owned it for a couple of months. used it at home 5 days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times. Zero hum or buzz from the unit. I should also mention that I do not have any drive/distortion pedals on my board."
5,"At the begining I wasn't sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this. so I decided to buy it and I started having problems right of the box. I notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals. then I started to play with them and realized that I had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain. so I decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used 4 with my pedals and surprise!. connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine. I also realized that pedals positions (routing signal) has something to do with it. I couldn't figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right. so I would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it. so it work as it is supposed to."
5,"This is the answer to your all your power supply needs. If you own more than 1 pedal (and we all do) You need this. It powers my Wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug. It comes with all the different power plug options and a daisy chain for 5 pedals. It has the adapters to power pedals without a place to plug in by attaching the battery snap to the battery place on the pedal then pluging into the daisychain. It also has the pin plugs to attach to the daisychain for pedals that require that kind of plug in. and it has a 10 foot lead wire so you can reach out to your pedals or pedalboard without having to drag a heavy extension cord across the stage to trip on while your playing. you'll save enough money to pay for it in no time. not having to buy batteries. Get it. you'll love it! I"
5,"I use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals.I don't use this on my pedal board and don't know if I would recommend it for heavy live use. I suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here.It does work well and will power many pedals at one time. I do not use it for powering only one pedal though. This device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals.I also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet.Easy to use - it is what it is."
5,"Arrived on time ... works as intended and maybe more.One day. I was pondering how best to de-clutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various 9V-12V DC equipment on my table or rack. Fortunately. I chanced upon this little gem and in an instant ... my problem was solved. I chose the 12V adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary 12V DC source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack. I also bought another similar unit form another source here on Amazon and used that to supply the 9V DC source to power the rest of the units that needed a 9V source. Everything worked fine and I relegated the remaining adapters to storage. Been working without a problem to this day."
5,"Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board. this was a logical choice of power. The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs. combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board. There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak. Further. with the transformer being well away from the board. there is zero AC hum. What's not to like here?"
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
5,"One Spots come with an 8-pedal multi plug. If you only have 4 pedals. or lets say you have 12. powering them with an 8 plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly. The left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they aren't plugged into pedals. Using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces. alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs. Very nice quality. just as with all one spot stuff. Great price. great purchase."
5,"If you're buying this and new to effects pedals (like I was). you'll be concerned whether it'll work with the inexpensive pedals you're likely to also be buying. especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you'll need them. The two most common types of inexpensive pedals are Danelectro and Behringer. and if you're like me they're ll you'll buy for quite a while. The good news is. you do NOT need to buy converters for them. This little beauty will run all your Behringer and Danelectro pedals. off from any of the standard 9V power supplies available (you don't NEED to buy a 1SPOT. I use it with a Behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less-expensive Planet Wave if you're working on an even tighter budget. In short. buy this product. it will save you its cost in 9V batteries within the first two months if you're on low-price pedals."
5,"This product isn't really one to review but it does what it advertises. I use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my TU-3 (great tuner by the way). Starting to build my pedal board so I figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a T-Rex fuel tank. which I'm planing on in the future. Great adapter for all of your pedals. decent quality. and only ten bucks. Can't beat it!"
5,"I bought this set mainly because I wanted a cheap micro-fiber cloth to polish off my guitars.  For the price of just a microfiber cloth. this set throws in a polish.The cloth is just what I wanted. It is soft and I feel good rubbing it on my instrument. I wish there were a little pouch that came with it so you can keep it separate -- mine is right now in a ziploc bag in my basement with my other loose gear.  The polish is just that -- it is works to bring out a shine. but it is not a cleaner.  You also have to be careful about where on your instrument you get the polish; there is a bit of wax in there and it is not string-friendly."
5,"The Product Itself Is Good. Shined My Guitar Up Nicely. The Cloth I Received Was A Black Microfiber Cloth With The Ernie Ball Logo. I Must Say That The Cloth Is Very Nice. It's Soft And Lint Free. So The Cloth Alone Was Worth Purchasing This Polish. After The Polish Is Gone I Will Probably Try Another Product. I Need Something That Will Conceal The Fine Scratches On My Guitar Finish. Probably Like A Guitar Wax. But All In All This Product Seems Good For Wiping Down The Guitar After Playing. Keeps The Instrument Nice And Shiny. It Removes Smudges And Fingerprints Quite Nicely. Not A Bad Product. It Arrived Within A Couple Of Days. I Am Satisfied With This Purchase"
5,"I recently bought this (May 2011) to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine.PROS:  Non-oily. water-like consistency; leaves no residue behind;  slight non-chemical odor that doesn't linger on your guitar; removes smudges. fingerprints. etc. and leaves a nice shine; comes with a large lint- and dust-free. fast-drying cloth (black); less expensive than most other guitar polishes.CONS:  The pump sprays in a very wide area. so be careful to avoid spraying strings. pickups. etc.The polish in the bottle works well and the lint-free cloth works well too.  I can't see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine."
5,"I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken. but I didn't want any down time. so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time. and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine. I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar. it falls almost immediately out of place again. So. I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed. unlike this brand new bad cable."
5,"Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty.I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement...no problems whatsoever.For the price you are paying (about $1 dollar per foot) you get good quality cable. good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends.Not the best. but not the worst. Good enough for live stage gigging and probably won't notice much difference if you are recording.I haven't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables.They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where. cable owner. etc.Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a 'feel good' purchase.I would recommend these cables and will buy again."
5,"Super low capacitance- on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from Mogami. Canare. etc. The connectors are fantastic and they come with Planet Waves' super-handy elastic cord wrap. These are outstanding guitar cables at a VERY good price. I used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors. but with these. I don't see the point. The lifetime exchange warranty also makes the DIY repair thing kind of pointless too (of course Amazon's return policy is still 30 days. so be aware of that- you'd need to mail it back to the MFR or take it to another dealer to exchange - that is if you ever had to)."
5,"been using these cables for three months now. I use them with aZoom G1N Guitar Multi Effects Pedaland they sound great. decided to get this one over the cheaper ones because after doing a little online research I found out that these are suppuosed to take abuse and hold their own better over time. they have a good lenght. of course this being taken in consideration what type of venues you'll be playing. so far I've only used them in rehearsal studios but will be using them live for the first time in a couple of halloween gig I've got coming up the end of the month."
5,"I have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my Mogami Gold cables.  If you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound. this might not be the cable for you.HOWEVER. for the price and purpose this a five star cable.  The plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection. but also feel sturdy and secure.  The gold plating ensures a solid connection.What I like most about this cable is that it's guaranteed for life and I can bring it to a Planet Waves authorized dealer for a replacement... or so their packaging claims.  I have not had to replace mine."
5,"I read a lot of positive reviews on the 9.5s and after some use. I am kind of disappointed.CONSTRUCTION:They are just like any other strings. just lighter gaugePACKAGING:It arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionPRICE:At $4.99 new with free 2 day shipping. this is a no brainer.CONCLUSION:I initially liked the feel of these strings. but the more I played the more I realized that it didnt have the tone I was looking for. I am used to 10s and 11s and though they are more difficult to bend with. they sound much fuller. I put these on my latest stratocaster build and have since replaced them with 10s."
5,"I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George. I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set."
5,"These strings are best suited for Strats if you want to keep those easy to bend leads but have a little bit more tone. They're also quite good on Les Paul style guitars if you like slinky strings. My issue with them is that the B string and the A string are a bit unbalanced with respect to the others. I would prefer if the B string were 0.012 instead of 0.0115 and if the A were 0.032 instead of 0.034. As such. I prefer to buy the strings individually and customize my own set that way. But if you're not too picky. this will suit you very well."
5,"I'm normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever.  It was used. and the strings were dismal sounding. so I bought these D'Addario EXLs.  They hold pitch beautifully.  My only complaint has to do with my guitar technique. not the strings.  Having used heavier strings forever on my acoustic guitars. the recommended lighter gauge recommended for the electric don't like my 'heavy-handed' approach to pressing down the strings.  As a result. the highly bendable lighter strings become sharp up near the nut until I relax and enjoy playing with a very light touch.  It will take some getting used to -- or else I'll simply move to heavier strings and leave the lighter ones to lead guitarists who know what they are doing.  All of that said. the strings are pure joy to play."
5,"I've used D'Addario's on so many different Guitar's the only opinion I can honestly give Ya is that They are the best. In the Studio or on Stage. They stay in tune and work very well with any pickup You are using. I put these on My Wife's Bass cause She is still learning and with a Fender Squire it sounds almost as good as a Precision Fender Bass. They stay true to the note so She will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time......"
5,"Best articulate bass string for the money.  I have one of the first versions of the Fender Precision Lyte bass from the 90s.  I have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued.  They sound great and stay in tune.  Sound like Rotosounds.....think Roger Glover. Geddy Lee. and Chris Squier.  Nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick.  I am not a slap style player so I can't comment on that.  I set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible. Try them. you'll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy."
5,"I use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars. except for the smaller Takamine New Yorker and A&L; Ami (I use the D'Addario custom lights).  I have grown a fondness for the Phosphor Bronze strings because of the perfect balance between the warm full sound with strumming and bright tones when picking.  ALso. the brightness is retained longer than other bronze and brass alloys I've tried. such as Martins and Elixirs.  These strings are quite durable and long-lasting.  In the 10 years I've been playing. I've never had these strings break on me (I've broken Martin and Elixir strings in the past).  The color-coded end balls help with the restringing.  I typically get the three-pack so I can restring a trio set of my herd at a time.  I really can't complain about anything.The individual gauges are: .012. .016. .024w. .032w. .042w. .053wHighly recommended."
5,"My guitar originally came with D'Addrio exp and they sounded good. I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good. but the finish was wearing fast. This time I got a 3 pack of EJ16-3d light. The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.But the sound is the problem. It's terrible. They sound very muddy. Crisp tone distinction is just not there. I thought light would be the better route. but now I'm not sure. I purchased some others to try. Also. since a purchased a 3 pack. I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings."
5,"These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull. and I absolutely love their sound. feel. and durability. The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast. The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes. these strings have a great. uplifting sound to them. hard to soft strums. Playing feels great with them. nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel. clean and smooth. When replacing. I ran into no problems. quick and easy. I love the strings and their price. definitely will stick with this brand as well."
5,"These strings from D'Addario are a personal favorite of mine. I love the EJ16 light gauge for their size and ease of use. I think the light gauge is a nice size that won't hurt your fingers. or put undue stress on your guitar. Not only that. but they sound great. Not too big or not too small! I have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass. I love how they color code their strings on the 'ball ends'. To me this makes it much easier when changing strings. You don't have to worry about mixing up your strings. I've also had no problem with the fit; unlike some brands. Give these a try. I think you'll be satisfied."
5,"I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar. and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S. and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break. I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all. I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and 'stretch' for few days playing. it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months. they still are playable. and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings."
5,"Low end made in China dreadnaught acoustic - Bristol - actually sounds somewhat fantastic in terms of low end resonance and sparkling high end.Here's what I've found. The way you string the guitar makes a difference. With practice I've become more proficient.Curve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate. Not just a simple bend but kind of bend them over my thumb so they can sort of catch before inserting the bridge pin. Then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm.I use a locking pattern on the tuning pegs and keep the string quite tight so it loops tightly around the peg.Then I use a microfiber cloth and wipe down each string after each time playing. - use my little finger to hook the cloth under each string and wipe down each length.Try to practice for about an hour daily. The tone as I say is pretty darn good. Played a high end adirondack. rosewood. name brand and was disappointed that it didn't sound that much better to me."
5,"Got the 3 pack and oh what a great difference on me. my guitar. and my sound.I'm a 62 YO newby to guitar!! This proves that easy helps. I have a big baby Taylor and when i needed new strings I went to the wrong place. got Martins installed -- wow did they make a (bad)diference to me.  Sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play. My friend said that he uses D'Addario and that they make ALL the difference in the world!! Tried them and he was right.  I changed my own (on the big Baby) and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position (instead of switching the E and B string like the dealer did!) MY Taylor recommends Elixr. but the D'Addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the Taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers!!"
5,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time. in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound. even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge. D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green. the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory). the high E is silver. and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great. but the first few times. it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string. hands down. after almost 40 years of playing."
5,"This brand has never disappointed me. regardless of the diameter of the strings. To me they just sound complete. Even the light strings don't sound tinny. which amazed me compared to other big names. They complement my Washburns very well. Though they are not top of the line models. I often get compliments like &#34;you're guitars must be expensive judging from the sound alone&#34;. But it's been a trial & error for me. I found that my Washburns sound better with this brand at least as far as my own ears are concerned."
5,"Always buy D'Addario strings for my 7 guitars.  Those strings stay tuned longer and will last me a little longer than others I have tried and believe me when I say that I tried many other types.  They have a great rating from other musicians. ....and the price is very affordable.  Highly recommended by this writer.  It is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings....it is a bit like discussing our likes in food. musicians. movies....etc.  We all have our likes and dislikes.....For my taste D'Addario EJ16-3D is usually the strings I drift back to whenever I buy strings.  I like their full sound and their lasting tones."
5,"I'm going to be honest. I have a cheap guitar. I payed $120 for an Epiphone at my local music store because I just play it recreationally. (Bonfires. sitting around the house. etc..) So I've never really put a nice set of strings on it because I figured strings aren't really going to make THAT much of a sound difference on this guitar. but I was way way way wrong! These strings aren't even that expensive. actually they're only a few more dollars than the usual cheap strings I put on my guitar. Yet. they completely  changed the sound of my guitar and it sounds like I forked over some money for a decent guitar! The strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips! I used to play once or twice a week. but I can't help but want to play every single day just to hear these things sing!"
5,"I bought these primarily because they are so cheap. The quality is good I would say - not great. but not terrible either. They sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull. They don't last nearly as long as Elixirs. but then again. they are a lot cheaper than Elixirs. I would recommend these for practice - no gigging with these as the sound isn't quite as crisp as I would think a performer would want. For the price though. it's hard to knock on them too much."
5,"I have restored an old REX Commander.  Yeah. I know;  never heard of it.  Beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck.  Frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing.  But the resonance of the D'Addario's really bring this old guitar to life with a thick juicy vibrance on the bass side. and bell like clarity on the treble side.  Not to mention how great they look.  The snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me.  Terrific strings for the price of cheapies."
5,"I needed to replace the strings on my acoustic. and chose these D'Addario's based on price and the favorable reviews given them by other users. I'm glad I chose them. as they play easily and have a nice sound. The lighter gauge allows for rapid yet sure fingering. and makes 'bending' notes for a blues effect a cinch. In fact. I occasionally have to remind myself there's no longer any need to press down nearly as hard as I previously had to when playing the heavier-gauge strings my guitar came with. In short. these strings make playing so much more enjoyable. I wish I'd gotten them from the start. But then. without the comparison of playing with the old strings. I might not appreciate playing with these half as much as I do now."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
5,"Tried D'Adario EJ36 Extra Light 12-string set on my Eko Ranger XII 12-string acoustic. and the EJ11 Light 6-string set on my Takamine.  No trouble stringing or tuning either set.  With the 0.012-0.53 Light weight strings I tuned a full note lower than normal to ease string tension. and they still sound fine.  Good acoustic. but a rather strong metalic. sound with a nice 'ring'. and notably more metalic than the EJ15 Phosphor Bronze strings.  Sound does deaden over time. as expected. but I especially noticed deadening on the high E and B non-wound strings. losing some of their 'ring'.  (Tried Elixir's for better longevity. but they did not sound as good to me as these D'Adario's.)"
5,"First time I ordered these was in a larger order. and Amazon forgot to put them in the box. Oops! I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you. Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately. so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze. but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these. and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it. I like their tone. and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time."
5,"Sound can be subjective and strings are a matter of debate that can go on forever.  Usually I wouldn't notice a significant difference between brands (except for any coated string that all sound like crap to my ears) but when I put D'addarios on my 000 I just couldn't believe the improvement over the Martins.  It took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear.  These consistently sound the most balanced and responsive... With the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else.I'm glad the search is over for awhile and I have a solid sweet baseline to experiment from here!"
5,"The mandolin arrived on time and came in a box within a box where the mandolin was wrapped. There was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke. I tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songs.I removed the pick guard because I really didn't like how it looked and it looks fine without it. The strings that come with it work fine and none snapped. Even if you end up not wanting to play it. you can always hang it somewhere because it looks nicer than I would have expected. The only problem I have is that the two G chords do not fit completely in the nut but i have heard that you can adjust it so it fits properly. I got this because I really enjoy the sound of a mandolin and the price is amazingly cheap. Also. another difficulty I had was that the tailpiece comes off easier than it goes back on. If you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out."
5,"Addario strings are ok.. Although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder... Aquila seems to be the most popular now. I have used both and I am satisfied with both...I play the soprano. concert. tenor. and baritone. Each one different in it on right...Also play the the concert scale banjolele.. Only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only IMHO.  Be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times:))))"
5,"First off. I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert. however. reading up on this. they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said. it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke. but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also. I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these."
5,"I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar. and will soon replace them.  On quality control. the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it. two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected. but it looks bad.  On sound. these seemed okay at first. but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week. especially the high B and E steel strings. which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck. more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball."
5,"As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out. you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two. even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in. but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up. but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far. they are great. Definitely recommended!"
5,"If you expect to get what you pay for. prepare to be disappointed. Sounds weak. Sounds old. Sounds worn. Sounds dull. I wanted to experience a new brand on my Stratocaster. I can afford to pay twice as much. But I am going to keep using my D'adario Strings from now on. I am so disappointed. These strings are for the &#34;campfire guitarist&#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling. tapping. pull offs. or sweepers. If you are a tone fanatic keep looking. If your guitar deserves the best. do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. Respect your GUITAR.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are made from China."
5,"I just had a guitar setup with DR Pure Blues 9's and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff.I've also noticed a bit of what I must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so.It almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as 'black' as the oxidation I've seen from low-quality strings.They also seem to have more 'string squeak' when changing chords than other brands - even after generously spritzing them withFingerease Guitar String LubricantI am not qualified to say if they truly give you that 'vintage tone' but they do sound decent.However. for $6 I would rather getDean Markley Blue Steel LT 2552 Electric Guitar Strings (.009-.042)or save some money and go withD'Addario EXL120 Electric Guitar Strings. Super Light. 9-42.EvenErnie Ball Super Slinky String Set (9 - 42)seem to feel better to me. but I am a Da-Dairy-O man. for now."
5,"I read good reviews about these strings on mylespaul.com and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price. I usually use DR Tite Fits. but these made me change for good They have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with P90's. I also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar I built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup. I will buy another set. DR strings never disappoint."
6,"I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless.  I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble (have to press hard for it to register).  No drops. no abuse.  The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic.  The keys feel hollow and light.  The available functions are great.  This is a classic calculator.  But the functions are no good if the keys stop working..."
6,"For simple calculations and discounted cash flows. this one is still the best.  I used this in my graduate business program. and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.  Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation (&#34;RPN&#34;). which is what this calculator uses. to be easy and intuitive.  Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.  It got lost in an office move. so I am purchasing another.  RJB."
6,"This is a well-designed. simple calculator that handles typical four-function math. Large. easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read. The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you don't hit more than one at a time. and are nicely spaced. The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g.. has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times."
6,"Texas Instruments Solar Calculater. This is a neat calculator and soent take up a ton of space on your desk. The numbers are large enough to see. And has never given me a false answer or calculation like other ones I have had.It has a solart cell so you do not have to be concerned with battery failure.  As your desl lamp or outside window light will keep it charged for you. Large led numbers are easy to read if your eye sight is not what it used to be.Purchased here on Amazon.com Where the whole World. Shops for Value."
6,"Outside of being able to attach this to your car's rim and use it as a tire. this calculator does about everything.  And. for a reasonable price!  This is the required calculator for the 6th grade here in Ohio. but I originally purchased mine for an advanced chemistry class for a top 10 university course 18 years ago.  It's still the one I grab every time I need a calculator - it performs all the scientific notation that I need. and doesn't become cumbersome like the TI-83.  I've used this for everything from calculus. microbiology. biochemistry to advanced chemistry and it's worked like a dream.  For the price. it just cannot be beat and durability. well that speaks for itself.  Highly. highly recommend!"
6,"I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently. they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership. not that I'm plugging Amazon. but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys. so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard. and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful."
6,"When working properly. these are wonderful calculators: affordable. simple to learn. fuctional. small. comes with case. easy to reset the memory. etc.It's not as bulky or expensive as something like the TI-89 and on series of graphing calculators.I recommend these calculators for all my chemistry classes. I've never had to use the sin. cos. and tan buttons. but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation (end. sci/eng. right. enter). It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once. you'll be fine.Occasionally. there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little. In that case. you have to be extra careful when inputting data. but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion: Good choice for science class."
6,"This is my third Texas Instruments calculator.  I also have a TI-84 and a Voyage 200. both of which I love.  I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class.  I didn't have a lot of money to spend. so this one seemed to fit the bill.  I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones. though.  It has all the functions I want. including storing the previous answer. but the buttons don't always register a key press.  It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental.  It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register.  It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press. either.  The button presses just don't get picked up some times."
6,"Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator.  Apparently. TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However. the calculator is complicated to use. and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore. the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.  But let me assure you they are definitely there. and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead."
6,"This is a really good. high-quality product.  It saves money because you can do it yourself.  It also saves time and gas - instead of going to the store. you can just do it yourself.High quality product - very highly recommended.Not very many people nowadays still write paper letters.  But. believe it or not. I still have a few people that I still correspond with on paper and snail mail.  I do prefer snail mail rather than any other way.  This is a good way to have some stationery in which to write a letter on."
6,"no. you won't fool anyone into thinking that these are commercial-quality cards. but they're pretty good. i prefer the matte finish over glossy which tend to have even flimsier paper. the size of these cards are basically a piece of 8.5'x11' paper folded in half. so that makes these larger than a normal commercial greeting card. but since they're 'regular paper-sized.' it's easy to design your own elements and print without worrying about sizing. orientation. etc...this is fine for casual card-making. despite using your printer's ink. it's still cheaper than buying greeting cards. it's a good option for a home hobbyist or for making last-minute cards if you don't feel like going to the store."
6,"I love making my own greeting cards.  These work perfectly with my canon inkjet printer.I like to take tons of pictures at parties and get togethers.  It is amazing how many funny looking faces some people make while trying to smile for a photo especially a big group.  There will always be one in the middle of doing something else instead of getting the smile right.  I like to take and isolate that one and later for their birthday or something make a funny card.  Or put funny sayings in word balloons over their heads and make a funny card.People like personalized cards and not only that. this is so much cheaper than cookie cutter cards at the store.  My friends all seem to look forward to my cards so I use lots of these Avery Half Fold products."
6,"This product provides a certain amount of convenience but is not anything special. It is 8.5x11-in. card stock for inkjet printers. with a crease in the middle for folding. It has a template number for use with word-processing and creative-project software. but templates can often be more trouble than they are worth. especially for the simple task of dividing a simple letter-sized sheet into two parts. There is a convenience. to be sure. in having correct-sized envelopes packaged with the paper; but again. there is nothing special about this size of envelope; and they feel somewhat flimsy. not exactly something in which to encase the results of your artistic labors.Plain is OK. but to get a top rating from me this product would have needed to have been special in some way. such as perhaps being glossy on half of one side in order to provide a space in which to print a photo vibrantly."
6,"I have been using this Avery half-fold greeting card stock for more than ten years.  I have tried other vendors and generic alternatives. but I have always gone back to Avery because of the print quality that you get from this product.On both sides of the greeting card. the printed output is smooth. crisp and sharp. yielding nice images.  There is no bleeding of the inkjet colors into the fibers of the paper.  The greeting card has a matt-coated finish on one side for the nice reproduction of pictures and images.  The card has a slight crease for easy folding.  I use Printshop for making cards. so I have never tried the free templates and software."
6,"I'm usually dissapointed in card makers but these are the best I have every used.  The paper looks much better right out of the box. works great in the printer. does not smear and most important gives you a photo-like image on the paper.They are a nice big size and come with their own envelopes (which is good since they are so big).  The images are really as good as premium photo paper when compared side by side.  They fold well. envelopes are good quality also.These might cost a little more than generic ones but well worth the price. cannot find one bad thing to say about them."
6,"I usually use Hallmark's greeting card paper and like it a lot.  Avery's product is equally good.  It is a true matte finish. so if you want a little more shine. this isn't for you.  The stock is thick enough that the printing doesn't show through and the fold is neat and professional.  No need to buy pre made cards if you have these on hand.  I use American Greeting's printable option a lot but my kids like to make their own cards with it.  They look much better than trying to fold your own card stock.  I would highly recommend these."
6,"My wife enjoys the creative process and personal touch of making/designing her own Special Occasion cards for family and friends.  The package of Avery white half-fold greeting cards containing 20 each of card stock and envelopes. is perfect for this endeavor.  The best feature of the card is the well-defined fold line. which helps when determining what side is the best or correct side. for the front of the card. The quality and sturdiness of the card stock is a big plus. It is a good weight...not heavy. but not too light. either! The paper accepts all the colored inks well. with the printing and pictures clear and clean-looking. The designs can slightly show through if printed on both sides. but that is not a big distraction.  She will definitely order this product again."
6,"This is nice thick card stock that does not bleed through. I used these for invitations and printed a full color picture on front. black & white print with a color image inside and a color image on the back. They looked fantastic! Of course I did need to keep the pages separated for a minute. so the ink could dry. but nothing smeared and they looked fabulous. The only trouble I had was that I couldn't find an option for this Avery size in my Word 7. so I used what I thought was closest to that size and it worked just fine (and that is why I didn't give it 5 stars). I would definitely purchase these again!"
6,"This Half-Fold  style along with  Avery's Quarter Fold heavy paper stock is the perfect medium to use for those who prefer to send personalized greeting cards.  Sure. you can use standard printer paper. but these scored sheets are whiter. brighter and make the colors and text pop. and it gives your cards ( that you worked long and hard on) that professional look.  These packages all come with matching envelopes which make it a great deal.  I don't  go out and spend $5-6.00 PER CARD for those  generic cards you get at drug stores anymore....... that's ridiculous.  I love designing and personalizing the cards I send out at a fraction of the cost."
6,"The paper quality is good. and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site.  The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards. to office-oriented announcement cards.  You have to provide the actual text; but the background images are part of the templates. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time.  Helpful instructions are close by.  The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software."
6,"I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great.  Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant.  I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded.  This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint. which is minor. is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier.  Other than that. I'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up."
6,"Great card stock. excellent paper and it worked great with my inkjet printer.  I chose cute Christmas card design. my photo and my personal message and was done in minutes!  But... I didn't like starting with just blank cards.  For advanced users I'm sure it's what everybody wants. blank slate so their imagination runs wild.  But I wanted to at least start with some color and pre-printed borders. so all I would need to pick is my pictures and write my message.  Overall. still 5 out of 5."
6,"This is a good calculator for those who are taking business classes.  This is helpful for those taking introductory courses in Accounting and also in Finance.  You can also use this to check your Excel spreadsheet and make sure that your formulas are correct.  This can be especially helpful when setting up an amortization table.  However. if your teacher will allow it. you may be better off with a graphing calculator. like a Ti-83.  You can use the Ti-83's TVM functions to do the same things. and it is a little bit easier to learn.Another thing to consider. for those who will be taking exams. is that you will need to master the functions of whatever model calculator will be allowed on the test.  While I prefer the TI-83. it may not be allowed in the CPA Exam. for example."
6,"I got this calculator at request from my Corporate Finance professor.Its the student version and pretty easy to use -- key thing being that you regularly clear your work from memory in between TVM problems.Once you get the hang of it. its very fast to calculate PV. NPV. FV. Cost of Capital. etc.Its not as solidly made as the TI-85's I had in Calc as an undergrad. but its small. lightweight and easy to use --- worth the 28$ and actually a bit quicker to solve finance problems than MS Excel(Note:  for real world NPVs. I do use Excel since thats more repetitive work and involves alot of different scenario modeling that would be less efficient on a manual calculator.)"
6,"I had gotten my first TI calculator in 6th or 7th grade. My TI-83+ has survived about 10 years of being dropped. thrown in frustration. left in hot/cold cars. etc. I bought this calculator for a finance class so that I could enter the calculations I need as they are taught in class rather than figuring it out on my graphing calculator. The first thing I noticed are the keys aren't nearly as good and are kind of annoying to press.  The case isn't very solid at all. I get the feeling if I were to drop it that would be the end of this calculator. As for actual calculation it has been fine so far. but you need to change decimal settings. Out of box it rounds to 2 places. which is inadequate. I recommend setting it to 5."
6,"I'd been avoiding getting a financial calculator for several years because I thought that it would be too complicated to learn how to use. and that using Excel or just calculating what I needed using algebra would be simpler and less probe to errors.  This calculator was required. by name. for a class I am taking. and I begrudgingly bought it.  I'm glad I did.  I can't believe how easy it is to use.  I still like excel or just doing the math (for simple TVM procedures). but am really impressed with the simplicity of this financial calculator.It is well made. cleanly designed. and a worthwhile purchase."
6,"I needed a calculator that could replace my simple desk calculator for quick figures at my desk. This one has done very well and seems like it will last some time. I bought Canon as that was my old brand and I like it although since I have large hands I wish it was a tad bit bigger. It was hard to determine which one to get shopping online but I am happy with it. There really is nothing I would like to change on it and will use it for years. Not much else to say as it is a basic calculator."
6,"Not much to say here. This is the 1/2&#34; size and I order a smaller size by mistake. (My own fault!!!) This is a perfect size for what I normally use this tape for and it's just as good as the 1/4&#34; size. The only problem I've run into on the this tape is being able to peel the back off the tape so I can stick it on a surface. I don't have long finger nails so it's hard sometime to get the backing off and instead of the tab the old plastic style tape used to give you to get ahold of the backing these newer tapes make you peel the label off from a cut down the middle and for me that's a bit hard. Otherwise no complains."
6,"I only wish the label maker itself had better directions on how to install and set up for the various widths of tape available.  But that is no fault of the replacement tape itself.  The lengthwise split in the backing makes removal of the backing VERY easy.  Additionally. it allows the user to stick the label on across only one half of the label first to make sure it's straight and get out any bubbles or creases - then remove the other half of the backing to smooth the label on the rest of the way.  Very good design."
6,"Although my ordering of this product was totally accidental I decided to keep it since it is such a wonderful product.  I just will not run out of tape for quite a while.  I would highly recommend this product and remember the most expensive label makers are not necessarily the best.2-16-2012I did not open this product right away but when I did I found the incorrect item had been sent not just by one company but two; neither of which are Amazon.com.  I have actually stopped doing business with one company because they would not allow me to return the item."
6,"This labeling tape is pretty good. and it is darn near impossible to screw it up: drop it into the label machine. type up your label(s). have it print. then peel off the backing and apply.  I actually love these labels vs. what I have used in the past as it is truly a print. peel. and stick type of label with no mess and crisp. professional-looking fonts.  This tape is also much better than the tape that originally came with the machine as this tape is much longer and will last for a lot more labels.To top everything else off as I type this review. I saved a little over $6 as the price I paid on Amazon was $13.59 vs. $19.99 for the same exact roll at the Office Depot down the street."
6,"For the price alone I gave this four stars. It is basic old fashioned soft foam with a knit fabric top. The best thing about this pad is the beautiful red color (which is why I ordered it) so if you care about that I recommend it.  If you have an older mouse I think this pad will be fine. but for my optical Logitech M305 the soft material creates a bit of drag. it performs better with the denser. thinner foam and smoother plastic type top.  I have found a good use for it. however. when I travel with my laptop and don't have a table or place to use the mouse. I cut it in half. placing the half on the bottom flat part of my laptop. the softer foam of this pad stays in place better on the laptop."
6,"This mouse pad works great with my optical mouse. It isn't thick and bulky nor is it a slippery vinyl pad. It's the perfect size to sit next to my keyboard along with my bead-filled wrist cushion. It is a COMFORTABLE mouse pad covered with a soft  polyester fabric attached to a non-skid sponge rubber base. The texture provides good control for my mouse. For me. it's the perfect mouse pad. it's a nice color. and the price is right. too!"
6,"Should I be complaining about something that was less than a dollar?Yes. absolutely.The top layer of material. the red layer. is coming off from both the top and bottom of the muse pad after about a week's worth of normal use. The adhesive or bonding process isn't holding the two layers together.The size of the mouse pad is very good.It tends to slide around on my desk with very little effort.Waste of time with this mouse pad. Surprised at the lack of quality from Belkin."
6,"I love this little unit. Slim. trim.portable quiet and does the job fast and effectively. I've been laminating EVERYTHING and then some. Laminated proof of insurance certificate. Registrations for cars. boats. motorcycles and waverunners. Medication List & Physicians List cards ( I typed a list of our medications and our doctors names and phone on a business card so I have it handy in case of emergency or filling out forms) Old photos. ID cards. newspaper clippings. prayer cards ( the ones you get from funerals). anything that would be beneficial to protect. I laminated.  It takes just SECONDS to do. and it comes out perfectly every time. Just picked up more business size laminating pouches from my local office supply. and I'm ready for more!"
6,"The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.The product description says the size is 9x8The technical details say the size is 9.5x8The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75I guess it's kind of a quibble. but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised.  It's also less than 1/8' thick as well.And. no. I wouldn't buy another."
6,"With the heavy wear that I give a mouse pad. I found that often I would have trouble getting the cursor precisely where I wanted.  Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react.  I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality. sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent.  The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor.  The trouble with the sensitivity of the 'click' was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad.  It meets all my requirements."
6,"Packaging says that the mouse pad is 50% pre-consumer recycled content. and that the packaging card is 100% post-consumer recycled material.Seems like a decent mouse pad and it'll fit my needs. I have knocked off one star because the pad is black and my other black Fellows mouse pads have-- over time-- become dirty with oil and dusk from hands and fingers. You therefore need to wash them frequently. I don't mean to slight a product because of it's color. but this pad should be available in grey or dark grey."
6,"I bought this as an alternative to high priced Canon 13X19 matte paper.  I do a lot of small signs/posters and the paper cost of the Canon stuff was getting prohibitive.  The quality of this paper is OK. heavier than standard paper. and with a smooth finish to make inkjet printing look good.  The thing is. I cut down the price per piece. by also using a lot of white space. from over $2 apiece to about .50. without any real loss of impact.Do not attempt to print photos on this paper. saturated business graphics look good. your vacation shots will not.For the price. give it a try for graphics."
6,"it's ink...from canon.  Works perfectly as it is intended.Please don't buy and review things and be stupid about them.  Ie.. if you don't want to spend money for ink...don't buy printers.  We all know how much inks costs...or relatively so.I love buying the canon 4 packs when I start running out of ink.I bought the pack when my magenta indicator was active and just waited.  Then it seemed like cyan followed a short while later. and then yellow and black are still waiting to join the group ;).Canon products are the best. from camcorders. cameras. scanners. printers and ink.  I have the Canon HV20. CanoScan5000f. and Canon i850."
6,"I have been using Canon inks and printers for years and awhile back. I decided to try out some of those generic ink tanks and ink kits (you know. the ones with the syringes?). Both ruined my printer. after awhile. They seem to work initially. but you can tell the colors are off. Sure. the generic inks are so much cheaper. but the costs of getting a new printer are going to make up for those few $ you saved on ink. Trust me on this one. buy Canon OEM cartridges!"
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
6,"Although the cartridges look like genuine Canon. they did not come in the Canon packaging shown in the illustration---which I find worrisome.The price I paid ($27) I paid is the price of fresh genuine virgin Canon. not the price of a cheap refills. OEM. 3rd-party cartridges. counterfit cartridges. or out-of-date repackaged cartridges.Amazon promptly offered a full refund (if I ship the cartridges back). but that really doesn't solve the issue.I suggest contacting the seller and asking for assurance that the product is fresh virgin original Canon cartridges in original Canon packaging before purchasing."
6,"I love my label-maker and can't imagine life without it. I label Rubbermaid totes. charging cables. A/V equipment. boxes. leftovers for the freezer. etc...and the tape always sticks to everything. The only thing I don't like is the wasted space before and after the printed text. but it's not enough to keep me from giving this baby five stars.I love the QWERTY keyboard. There's enough variety in printing (sizes. special characters. outlines. etc.) to keep things interesting. and it's fairly easy to understand without having to resort to the instructions each time. That said. I'm fairly bland with it and pretty much use one or two main settings all the time."
6,"I have had this labeller for several years. and never had the label tape bind up. The unit is easy to use--hitting the function keys allows you to change print size. and there is a cutter on the side to dispense the label when printed. The previous entry stays on the screen for printing multiple copies. It's a useful device for labeling food bags in the freezer. making file folder labels. and any number of things that I used to label with the old embossing type label tape. The batteries seem to last plenty long (it takes AA's.) No complaints here. priceworthy and works well."
6,"The PT-65 has become a lifesaver in my workplace.  Since I work with Nortel phone systems. life can get pretty wild when you have a load of phones to punch down on blocks that go to different wings of a building.  I carry the PT-65 with me to new job sites and label each punch-down block so that I can easily keep track of what goes where.  Also. the labels look very professional when placed on folders in the office.Overall. this labeler is quite easy to use and very convenient to carry around from job to job.  I'm sure it works great with computers. filing systems. and even baseball card collections as well."
6,"This is a nice labeler.  I got it as a present more than a year ago and have found that it has so many uses.  I label everything with it.  I can choose different type styles and sizes.  I can underline and choose a frame.  I can even check the length of the label before I print it.The labels are waterproof.  I've labeled ice packs that I keep in the freezer and send to school with my kids.  I've also labeled food containers that end up in the dishwasher.  The labels do not come off when wet. not even in the dishwasher.There are so many uses for this labeler.  It's a great buy."
6,"Excellent product! This is one of the first electronic devices that gets my &quot;thumbs up!&quot; within the first day of using it! And it get addicting making labels. for this thing here. that thing there. Fun and easy!Excellent design. very comfortable to hold in your hand with a good weight/balance [not too heavy. not too light] and good size. The buttons are not too small and the arrangement of the buttons are easily accessible and easy to learn.Excellent accessories with different types of ink/tapes and sizes! Very good printout of labels. quick and no jamming! and easy to cut. Wonderful smoothness and professional look to the labels. Good stickiness to objects too [plastic. metal. leather. paper]. waterproof as well.I would recommend this 100%. Brother's has created a product that is affordably cheap and easy to use. fun and reliable. Nothing to complain!"
6,"What can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable. They have a plain. cylindrical body. a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap. and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within. They won't win any beauty contests. but they do put ink on paper. and they do it cheaply. Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly. Other than that. these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat."
6,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these! This is my Second Order of these which I have placed! When I find something that works as nice and well as These Do. I am a Very Happy Camper! These are really Good Quality Pens and they last! I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink. with very little use. I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals. does a lot of writing. or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use! I would have rated these a TEN if there were more stars! Thanks BIC and AMAZON! These were a Great Deal and well worth purchasing!"
6,"We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens. with the white barrel. medium or fine points.  I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design.  It says white barrel in the description. but I hoped to get this new color.  Luckily I did.  The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside. and it looks more interesting than the traditional white.  But. I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it.  It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always. too.  Not as good as the Cristal pens. but decent.  The Cristal pens have a wider point or something. even though these are both labeled as medium points.  If you want a basic blue ballpoint. this is it."
6,"I bought a whole case of these Mead spiral notebooks for my kids.  The pages are thin. they aren't perforated. but the price was right (back to school sales) and I'm not expecting much for school notebooks.  My biggest qualm is the wire spiral eventually getting tangled around the holes on the left edge.  It's not neat and pretty after a while and the covers don't sit well then.  They do start out looking nice and I'm not really complaining.The pages are wide-ruled. good for elementary school kids.  Both of my kids use them and they don't have any issues with them."
6,"My notebook with a bluish-purple cover arrived within several days of placing the order. The price alone for this notebook is good. but when you consider free delivery. it's an even better deal. I always like having spare notebooks around in case I need notebook paper or a student needs paper. The paper is wide ruled for those who like that configuration. Pages aren't perforated for easy removal. but at this price point it can't be expected.This notebook has the SFI. certified sourcing emblem on the cover."
6,"I've ordered several of these Mead Spiral notebooks from Amazon. They are affordable and always ship quickly. arriving in pristine condition. Colors are variable. Nothing out of the ordinary here. just a notebook you could buy at a store. but it's nice to have it delivered without paying more rather than having to buy it at the store. Another advantage is that you can have them shipped in bulk. I tend to go through a lot of notebooks and I've been pleased with the service ordering through Amazon. I recommend it."
6,"I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters. I'm very happy with how well it works. The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong. so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape. This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250' (6.3 m) long. so these are pretty expensive! Apart from the price. the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect."
6,"The other day I needed to mount a paper towel holder in my kitchen.  I have had a hard time in the past trying to drill into our kitchen cupboards. so I used this tape instead.  I was only able to use 2 small pieces about 1 inch each in length.  It has now been up all week!  I am impressed.  Most of the time I usually thing that tape is just tape and I've had mixed experiences with tape of this type. But. with this tape I am pleased!"
6,"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately. I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items. I use the temporary 'command' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent. so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."
6,"This can come in handy for different home projects and decorating. For example. I decorated a huge bathroom mirror with small framed pictures using this double sided tape. it looked great. Perfect when you can't or don't want to ruin a wall with a nail.  I also decorated the ceramic tile backsplash in the kitchen with the same sort of small framed pictures.  The tape is not too hard to remove from the glass/mirror/tile surfaces but expect some difficulty when removing from painted walls.  A little sanding of the residue is needed."
6,"I haven't used this a lot yet. but. based on my fairly small sample of experience. this product is a lot stronger than other mounting tape I've tried.  We used it putting up posters at a fundraising event and it did an outstanding job - even on a brick wall.  It gripped the wall and the posters very well.  It didn't take a great deal of length to hold bulky and moderately heavy posters.  Pretty much exactly what you're looking for from a product like this."
6,"Scotch is the brand I usually buy when looking for tapes.  I have bought the two sided tapes for years now. for both business and personal needs.  The early lesson I learned was to make doubly sure that you mount to a surface where you won't want to remove the item from later.  If you mount a picture to a painted wall. for example. and then remove it the paint will most likely comme off with the tape.  This tape here is clearly called 'Permanent' for good reason."
6,"I remember learning. back in 1st or 2nd grade. how to make standard scotch tape in to double sided tape by just making a loop. That lesson is probably the most-used lesson from that time in my life and I still use that trick on a somewhat regular basis. Scotch Mounting Tape steps things up a couple of notches. Since receiving this tape I have used it to secure a large calendar to my desk. hand a couple of light pictures. and to hold display bottles in place at a chocolate fair.It's light. inexpensive. durable and is handy to have around."
6,"3M's Scotch is THE brand to look for all your mounting needs.  I've used their mounting sprays. 'invisible' tape. and for commercial applications (mounting permanent signs) with their 3M VHB foam tape.  Each serves its unique purpose.For this tape. its ideal for posters. plaques. signs. and some lightweight picture frames.  When mounting an item. you can remove/reposition (for perfectionists like me. this is a huge plus!).  Let it sit for a while and it becomes more permanent.  Keep in mind that this is just foam tape. and not ideal for holding very heavy items.  3M recommends that the items you mount not exceed 2 lbs.  If you need to mount something heavier. and more permanent. consider 3M's VHB (very high bond) tape (which is also very expensive!). or silicone caulking (can be found at most home improvement stores)."
6,"This Scotch mounting tape is sticky enough to hold heavier items. but it also removes easily without taking the finish with it. For heavier items. I put more on the back of the wall hanging. or object. and on lighter items I use less. Also. it really sticks to ceramic. even if it has a glossy glaze! Some mounting tape is not gonna stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use. but with this product. only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop. Midstream. I decided I wanted the tiles in a different arrangement. and it was easy to lift them off the wall. without tearing the paint. and move them. (I think when dry. and 'set' they might not be so easy to move. because the tape is so sticky. so we'll see.) Excellent. effective. and easy to use product! Recommended."
6,"I have used this product in both in the tape and squares form for many years.  I live in California where we get many little earthquakes. and I have grandchildren who occasionally slam doors. so anything hanging on the walls could shift. I can't stand having mirrors. pictures. clocks. etc. hanging crooked.  I hang the object with a picture-hangar which holds the weight. but always put mounting tape at two corners which holds the frame straight on the wall. This mounting tape is permanent - so place it where you want it to stay.  I would never put it on the back of a clock. for instance. if the battery will need changing once a year.  I have found it takes patience to remove it from any surface.  This product is also useful for mounting on surfaces that cannot tolerate a nail or screw hole.  Scotch mounting tape is part of my tool box arsenal."
6,"This tape is proving to be very useful.  Thus far. it has held securely.  You can even use it to hold up a big table-top flush against the wall.  The only problem that you have to be careful with the paint.  If you decide that you hung up your picture in the wrong place and try to move it. some of the paint may come off.  Although I guess you should expect that.  It is. after all. permanent tape.  All. in all. it delivers on its promise: allowing you to hang things up without bothering with nails.  And the price is right.  I recommend it."
6,"If you have something such as a poster. sign. or brochure holder that you'd like to mount on a wall or other solid surface this is a useful product. The tape is a half inch wide and has adhesive on both sides. It works best on a smooth surface and is fairly strong (recommended for holding up to 2 lbs). This could be used for a variety of projects where you wish to mount something permanently on a wall. If you'd rather not nail or screw something into the wall then this is a good alternative - just don't expect for this tape to come off later without leaving a residue that you'll need to clean or scrape off. Also. there's no tape-cutting mechanism on the roll so you'll need a scissors or utility knife to cut the tape."
6,"So far I've used this double sided foam tape to mount photos and mounted a small clock on glass. It hasgood holding power and rated to hold 2 lbs. It does depend what you mount to. someone stated it wouldn'thold on plaster walls. if the surface you use is weak the tape isn't going to change this fact. I mounted abadge back on a cars painted surface. this tape is strong enough for jobs like this. This is a good generaluse double sided white foam tape. the roll is 1/2' wide X 75' long. other sizes are offered but I found thisis a good general use size."
6,"This tape is definitely useful in a lot of ways.  Picture hanging (if it isn't too heavy or fragile). securing items to shelves so they don't get broken. I also used some to keep a shoe holder on my closet shelf from sliding.  There are so many ways this can be used. the limit is your imagination.  Keep in mind. though. that this isn't like Command strips...you can (and probably will) lose some paint or do damage on finished surfaces when you go to remove it.  As long as you're not worried about it being permanent. I highly recommend it."
6,"Scotch 1/2' Mounting Tape comes in very handy for many uses. Last week I installed several new devices in my living room home entertainment cabinet. This mounting tape worked great for cord control. routing and organization. I used it to mount a Roku box on the inside of a cabinet sidewall. it is being held firmly and even the pressure from some of the cables and wires trying to push it away from the wall has not sprung it. I also mounted a small antenna amplifier to the back of a flat screen TV. I'll be curious to see how the heat from the television effects the tape over time. If it's bad news I'll let you know. Good Stuff!"
6,"I create presentation boards for design presentations and I often find myself needing to affix a piece of marble. tile or carpet to the board. Glue doesn't hold and regular tape is a joke. Scotch mounting tape. however. does the job. Normally if I affix a piece of marble it has fallen off of the board by the end of the day - I have marble still sticking to the board weeks later and no signs of letting go. This tape is amazing and. though I can't say for sure. it truly seems to be a permanent tape. Highly recommended."
6,"Scotch states this is for permanent mounting. but I'd hold back on that until a year goes by.  I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice. in that I don't have to drive a nail into the wall.  But the biggest use I have for Scotch's (double sided) mounting tape is for flat surfaces.  Where most people have kids knocking things about. I have little earthquakes but most horrendously. cats!  My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops.  I have some glass vases. vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves.  I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf.  I've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor.  For that peace of mind alone. this tape is worth it.  Plus the price is right."
6,"My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks. which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product. but that isn't saying much."
6,"This mounting tape has worked out well on many different surfaces. It is pretty strong too. I have actually used it to hang smaller/lighter pictures in frames and none have come falling down..yet. There is a good amount of tape in the roll. so you can get a good number of things hung with it. I also used it to hang one of the full length door mirrors on my daughter's bedroom door. It has held so far so good..and that is even with her slamming the door at times. I am getting pretty brave at using it for larger. heavier items - I just make sure to use a good bit of the tape around all edges. so that it is secure."
6,"I have used this on tile. metal. glass and interior walls and all surfaces are compatible with this mounting tape in my experience.  I did notice that if the surface is ice cold. make sure you warm the area up with a hairdryer if possible for a better stick.  To remove. I slid a razor through the foam core and used Goo Gone to remove the rest of the square. worked great!  I was able to hang a wipe board near my front door than I had been meaning to mount for months. this stuff gets the job done!"
6,"There's not much to say. This is double-sided mounting tape. and it holds tight. It's easy to apply. and works for most lightweight mounting jobs. It is labeled as 'permanent'. so I wouldn't recommend using this on anything you want to eventually remove it from. It's not coming off without some effort and residue left behind.My only complaint is that it's a small roll. but that's to be expected.There's really no competition. 3M basically invented this sort of thing."
6,"There are many applications for this tape. but our favorite is in kids projects.  The foam layer between the two sides of tape allows you to connect two surfaces that would not lie completely flush against each other (making it impossible to use regular two-sided tape).  The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance; for example. mounting something inside a remote control vehicle.  Also. while this is meant as permanent tape. the foam layer can. in some applications. give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped.  We keep a roll of this on our workshop bench as there is invariably some situation where it is preferable to gluing. nailing. sewing. velcroing. etc."
6,"Great product we used it mount all our travel photos above are bed. One helpful hint. be sure to allow the paint to cure for a few weeks. so that it doesn't lifts off easily. Also. we found it worked best when you prime the walls before you paint it makes a difference when using mounting tape. The paint and texture don't come off so easily when you take the tape off later--which is great. We change out the photos every few months when we go on another trip. We have some photos that have been up for over a year and there is no lift in the corners like you see with other mounting two side tape."
6,"We have been using Scotch brand tape products for decades but not. until now. have we used this product. It is difficult to rate it because of infrequent need but on the one occasion we have used it thus far. it did all that we had hoped it would. If the item remains firmly attached after a month or so. I will add a star to my rating. Meanwhile. perhaps other uses will emerge. Tests and evaluations continue.Meanwhile. again. I say 'Thank You' to the Amazonians for the Vine Program."
6,"This is an excellent double sided mounting tape for small items. However. you have to make sure the surface you attach it to is absolutely clean. If there is oil. dirt. grease. etc. it is not going to stick for very long. And the surface you attach it to has to be dry and stay dry and it has to be strong enough to hold whatever you are mounting. If the surface has been waxed. it may not stick for very long. All you have to do is clean the area where you are going to use it and it will do an excellent job. This is a light to medium strength mounting tape and should not be subject to heat or vibration. If you want to mount something in your car or boat. there are other very high strength mounting tapes. If you want to mount a small picture or similar then use 4 good sized pieces. one in each corner. don't use just one in the middle. This mounting tape would be excellent for mounting poster boards."
6,"If you have items that you want to mount on the wall. but don't want to drive nails. this is the tape for you.  I have used this to put up small pictures in my daughters' rooms. and it works great.  I wouldn't trust any kind of tape for large pictures. but that is not why you would buy this.One thing to be aware of....it's biggest strength is also somewhat of a weakness.  Once you put something on the wall with this tape. it is staying on the wall.  It does not remove easily. and thus is not suitable for mounting things you may want to move from time to time (i.e. posters in a child's room. wall calendars. etc.). They make other kind of lightweight. low adhesion tapes. that might be more suitable for that.Overall....great at what it does and recommended."
6,"This tape is great for hardware projects requiring a high strength but potentially temporary bond. I have often used it for building mechanical and electrical gadgets as well as for repairs on household items. It has worked well on both flat and irregular surfaces.  I would highly recommend the Scotch exterior mounting tape over the foam-based tapes for any project -- indoor or outside as it holds up better under repeated mechanical stress.In one example. I used this tape to affix several one pound lead weights to flight simulator rudder pedals that were ultimately removed. The removal was an arduous process. I found that using a Weller heat gun and hand scraper was the best method. If you are using this mounting tape in situation where it may need to be removed. you might was to check the durability of the surface first as any paint/finish could be damaged."
6,"I've used many different typs of mouse pads with many different kinds on surfaces and I've always liked the one color darker type cloth pads. The pads with patterns and things printed on them can cause a problem with some laser mice and I've run into that many times. The back surface is great and the thing I liked best was it wasn't to thick. Some pads have a really thick rubber base and that tends to raise the pad a bit to high for me. I have my mouse pad holder mounted to the left side of my KB on a center desk drawer and this pad nicely covers the whole surface and isn't to thick as my old one was. The darker color seems to have helped my tracking too. I've ordered two more of these. one for another computer's mouse and a spare. Really like this pad!"
6,"For me. I tried this very nice quality Blue Belkin Standard Mouse Pad and was happily surprised. This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried! First. I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad. Then I tried out my new Verbatim Mini Mouse (the retractable type). The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad. In addition. the back of this mouse pad is coated and stays in place (no slipping on my desk--it stays nicely in place).Looking for a very good quality and basic mouse pad that works without paying a high cost? Look no further. this is the mouse pad I suggest to you. And I believe that you will be very happy with it.Highly recommend this Belkin Mouse Pad!"
6,"NICE FOR THE PRICE. I HAD EARLIER ORDERED A MOUSE PAD FROM AMAZON WHICH STATED IT HAD A CALENDAR ON IT. i THOUGHT IT WAS EMBEDDED IN THE PAD. FOOL THAT I MAY BE. IT WAS NOT. IT WAS PAPERS ALL IN A CALENDAR AND STUCK TO A PIECE OF CARDBOARD. I EVEN PAID SHIPPING. IT SELF DESTROYED AND I COULD NOT RETURN IT. BUT WRITE IT UP I WILL.THIS IS THE REPLACEMNT.UNTIL I FIND ONE I CAN SEE AND FEEL IN A STORE SOMEWHERE THAT HAS A NICE PHOTO ON IT. THIS WILL BE FINE. JUST FINE. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT ADHERES TO THE DESK AND LETS MY MOUSE ROLL FOR A COUPLE OF DOLLARS. IT IS JUST FINE."
6,"This is a very ordinary mousepad. though the Belkin name at least assures you of decent quality for a mundane yet necessary item.  It replaces a dirty. ink-stained. slightly smaller red mouse pad.  My 5-star rating includes considerations of pricing and packaging along with Belkin quality.  I've received similar pads that were all rolled up and misshapen so that they would fit into cheap packaging and require less postage.  But as a Prime product. this two dollar mouse pad. rest assured. will arrive in a full and firm cardboard box.  No unfolding. pressing. or ironing required before you're able to use it without agitation.  The pad. moreover. is sealed in a Belkin cellophane wrap. making it a nice. inexpensive gift for a friend or associate on an otherwise overcast day."
6,"How bad can a mouse pad be?  That's what I thought....First. be aware this is a HARD top mouse pad.  Basically. it is a hard sheet of blue plastic glued onto a 3/32' foam pad.  Not a rubber pad like other mouse pads. but a foamy pad.The plastic top is bigger than the foam pad on all sides. and cuts into my hand which rests on the edge of the pad.The mouse pad isn't quite flat on the table - the plastic top is slightly curled and one edge of the mouse pad sticks up slightly until I push the mouse over it.  It is very distracting.Finally. the surface is just rough enough to make a loud scratchy nose as my optical mouse moves over it.  VERY annoying.This is the WORST mouse pad I've ever used.The only pro is it has a weird new plastic smell that reminds me of grape popsicles. so 2 stars."
6,"I don't understand the number of negative reviews... this product works great.  Some reviewers said it's plastic and breaks easily.  Yes. it's plastic and I suppose you could break it without too much difficulty but it doesn't break under normal use.  I use mine to hold open textbooks that measure 10'x16' (when open) and are over 500 pages.  The book holder works fine in all respects.  Specifically. it supports the book without tipping or wobbling as I turn the pages. the pages are prevented from turning by themselves even with a fan blowing on it. I can slide it across my desk without it collapsing and when I'm done it folds flat for easy storage.  One feature I really like is the fact that the tabs that normally hold the pages in place can be folded flat to accommodate very large books (700+ pages).  I don't know what else I could ask from a product such as this!  I can recommend this product without reservation."
6,"This book holder is made of plastic and seems a little flimsy. but so far it's holding up decently. The back stand uses two pieces. and is adjustable. There are two tabs in the front which you can move forward and backward so that you can turn pages more easily or insert new books without fear of ruining a page. They are also a problem. I have found that they can pop out from use as they only have a fitted notch keeping them in place at the bottom of the unit.I can also see how a book larger than 2 inches in thickness can be an issue. as the depth of the base is roughly an inch deep. I've not yet had to work with this (I use it for typing up class notes from notebooks at this time) with a book of that size. but i can picture my coffee cup coming into play if I ever use it with a book of that size."
6,"I've been using their labels for more than 20 years -- they are SO easy to use on the computer. and these 08167 labels print equally well on my Ink Jet AND laser printer.Feeding them through a copier is a cinch too.These 08167 labels peel easily. the ink impressions are sharp and crisp. in color OR black and white.I have had no problem with the Avery labels' adhesive longevity in the past -- let's see how well these 08167's do -- I would think that they will be just as good as their predecessors."
6,"Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets). printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site. downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future. now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive).  Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use; the pop-up easy peel feature is great. too:  no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet.  These peel quickly from the sheet. simply by gently folding the backing slightly.  Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet; highly recommended for EASE OF USE."
6,"I absolutely love these mailing labels!  They are convenient. and make life so much easier!  These mailing labels are smaller than certain other types of labels; therefore. more labels will fit on each sheet.  And if you use a lot of mailing labels. then that does you a lot of good.They print so quickly and easily.  Whenever you need a label. just peel it off.  These label sheets save a lot of time and energy. and are so neat.Highly recommended if you use mailing labels.And these are for ink jet printers. which is the type of printer I have at home."
6,"The sell feature on these labels is that they are easy to peel. but they could be much more versatile were they larger and allowed for design.  The template is most basic. and while the small size gives you 2.000 labels per package. I'd rather have 1.000 larger. designable labels.  As they are. I can only fit three lines of text if I use size 8 font!  Improvements can allow for a template that accepts icons/avatars so that one could design according to company logo. season (falling leaves. snowflakes). event (birthday balloons) or holiday (jack o lanterns. bunnies. cornucopia). I'd rather use the pre-printed friendly. cheerful. colorful labels that I receive from charitable orgs."
6,"I love Avery labels!  Their free templates are easy to find and download.  The labels print flawlessly every time.  And they are durable.  I really can't say enough about these terrific time savers.  I design my own return address labels with a family portrait on them. I print out address labels for my holiday cards. and I print larger labels for packages. all with ease!  If you are looking for high quality labels that won't let you down. Avery is the way to go..."
6,"These are good. but so are other brands. for example 3M.  Comparing the two. the Avery look thicker/brighter. but when held up to a light. they look about the same.The adhesive on these and the 3M are about the same. which is to say not very strong. but adequate for a small return address label.The Easy Peel feature makes it convenient to remove from the sheet.  But 3M also has this feature.The labels dry quickly and do not smudge.While I cannot find anything significantly wrong with these. I also find nothing really outstanding that is not available from other brands.In the end. I would probably go with whichever is cheaper and/or you can get with free shipping."
6,"You'd think address labels would be a standard product by now. but Avery has added several new features that make this product an excellent purchase. especially if you have a color inkjet printer:1) Smudge Free2) Jam Free3) Pop-up Edge for easy peeling4) Squeezes 80 labels x 25 sheets in one package = 2000 address labels!But here is the best feature of all: by going to [...] and selecting templates for product number 8167. you get many designs in Word. all ready to go. You can customize the provided logos and/or fonts of course. This saves a lot of time setting your mailing project up!"
6,"I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive. but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels!  They're so easy to use. just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila. you'll have instant return address labels!  I didn't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned. and my favorite part was the fact that they don't smear!  They're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope. box. etc.  With all the ebay shipping I do. these have come quite in handy.Great product. highly recommend!"
6,"Part of my business is printing lots and lots of address labels; for myself as well as for customers. Avery has never let me down. This product. the Easy peel. is superior to every other type I have tried. Not only are they easy to remove. but they stick to the envelop or package better than the cheaper brands. You might think saving a dollar and buying the office brand is a good idea. but those things come off in the mail. My Avery labels ride all the way to their destination. They also hold ink well (I put artwork on them as part of my business).Recommended for commercial and residential use.Ellen C Maze"
6,"These labels are designed for inkjet printers often found on desktops.  The inkjet priter compatibility is just a coating on the paper that ensures the ink does not wick out and become unreadable in fine fonts.Return address labels have many convenient uses besides their obvious use.  With one line of print down the center. they can be used on CD jewell cases down the spine to form a library system with title and index number for CD changers or ipod lists to data backups and storage libraries.In product design and prototyping we often use this smaller label to print at the far end with the print running vertically with 1 or 2 tiny lines of type. then roll them around wires with only that last part showing.  As designs shrink the smaller labels are very helpful.Avery provides full product support with templates in ms-word format that make printing on a particular label exceptionally easy if your equipment is calibrated with the right drivers."
6,"This is a set of return address labels designed for inkjet printer use (no guarantee that it will come out as intended with a laser printer. but it can likely be used in a laser printer if needed).  Avery labels are reliable and all you need to do is follow instructions. using the template for these sheets with your office/wordprocessing software.  Just print and peel and stick the label on your envelope.  This way you can design your own personalized return address labels.  My only suggestion for improving Avery's labels would be to reduce retail prices on them so more people would think of making their own labels."
6,"I'm a big fan of printing my own return address labels and these are the best ones so far.I went to the Avery website for the free templates and using Microsoft Word.I printed the best labels I've ever printed & it was faster and more accurate than it's ever been.The labels themselves are are the best I've seen so far.you just bend the sheet at the column and the edge of the label pops up so you can peel it off.so much easier than in the past.The reason these are my favorite labels is because they are 1/2 an inch tall and 1 3/4 inch long and are perfect for putting on printed return forms instead of trying to fit my clumsy handwriting in the tiny writing space.I really like these...They're Great!"
6,"I usually love all Avery products and I must say that I'm adding this product to my favorites as well.  These labels printed out well and I had no smearing when I applied them to my mailing envelopes.  Also. what I loved about them that it wasn't hard to peel and reposition them on the envelope once it caught.  The color blended nicely with my white evenlopes so well. that it appeared as if I printed the address on the envelope itself. I love these labels! From now on. I'll be buying these instead of the store brand I always buy."
6,"FIrst. before you order these. pay attention to the dimensions listed in the description.  These are RETURN address labels -- the small ones you stick in the corner of the envelope -- NOT the usually-larger address labels that contain the address where you want your letter to go.  They are. therefore. SMALLER than address labels.  Don't order these expecting to get larger labels.  :-)That said. these are excellent quality. print easily in my inkjet printer. and. as the package says. are easy to peel off the backing sheet.  I used one of the templates I got from the Avery website (I'm on a Mac. using Microsoft Word for the Mac). and designed some nice-looking labels.  Don't expect to fit more than 3 lines of small print on each label.  Like I said. these are small."
6,"These Avery Easy Peel Return Address labels worked perfectly for me.  The software that you can download from Avery's website installed easily into my mid level Windows 7 machine and was self explanatory to use.  Within a few short minutes I was cranking out my own custom labels with no problems at all.Believe it or not these are the first labels I have ever made myself.  I use a middle of the road HP 4680 printer and they fed into the machine perfectly. never jamming and printed exactly right.  The labels peel off very easily and as advertised they do NOT smear which was something I had wondered about.I honestly can't see why I would need anything else.  They ARE a bit small but these are sold as RETURN address labels and are appropriately sized so bear that in mind.  Reasonably priced as well."
6,"The high quality of Avery products is once again found in these Easy Peel Return Address Labels for use with ink jet printers.The labels peel off easily and quickly with only a slight flexion of the carrier sheet material.  In fact. due to the design. flexion of the carrier sheet is really no longer necessary.The fast. easy peel feature is achieved by stripping off the extra surrounding waste label paper that is between the labels.  This leaves the labels as free-standing units on the carrier sheet.For anyone who has ever had to put labels on a number of letters. this saves substantial time and mess.  Other brands really have some catching up to do!"
6,"I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great. but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels. but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit. saved the template. and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the 'Easy Peel' and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!"
6,"Having moved recently. I needed some new address labels. I had always ordered address labels from those mail in label companies.  This is the first time I tried my own.  So did I think it was worth it?  DEFINITELY!!!  I can print sheet after sheet with a variety of pictures; I can change my pictures after a couple of months to reflect holidays. seasons. you name it!  The only complaint I have is that I would probably choose a bit larger size... these were a little small.  I used Avery's online printing program and it worked pretty good... not perfectly lined up. but after I adjusted it. it was fine.  For the price. you simply cannot beat it.  Highly recommend!!!!"
6,"Unlike other return address labels. these Avery labels have an innovative 'easy peel' feature that lets you fold back the perforation and remove the printed labels by just grabbing the exposed edge. It's so well designed. you wonder why nobody thought of this sooner.Designed specifically for inkjet printers. these labels print crisply. dry quickly. and avoid smudging.As many have noted. the small size of these labels doesn't leave much room for error on your printing software / printer driver / margin settings. You'll want to use the Avery template 5167 (free download from Avery. built into most other software including Microsoft Word) to start. Print a few sample pages on regular paper using your software and printer settings. Hold it up to the light with a blank label sheet in front to make any fine adjustments to margins.Note - the small size of these labels isn't for everyone - there's not much room for a custom graphic or logo. But that's why Avery offers multiple product choices!"
6,"I find the Avery labels the easiest to use.  Every software package I've ever attempted has the Avery Label templates already built in. and the labels peel off easily. and stay stuck to the envelope during mailing.I like to use the Return Address size labels for many different uses: pricing items for a garage sale. file folders (yes. they make file folder labels. but I'm frugal). labeling books and DVDs. and I also would use them if sending bottles/baby items to a daycare facility.I am a very frugal shopper. but when it comes to labels I feel Avery's quality justifies the price.  I would recommend Avery brand labels to anyone!"
6,"It might seem silly to be excited about labels but I am. I've been looking for labels that aren't a pain in the you-know-what and I've found them.These labels are return address label sized (80/sheet). I'll be using them for that as well but my initial use is for 'reorder' labels on products I sell. The printing is clear and smudge-proof. important for labels with small print that might be exposed to liquids or creams.What I like best about these is the Easy Peel feature. which will save much time and aggravation when I'm label several items (or envelopes) at once. I'll be ordering these again but with 80 labels per sheet. it may be a while."
6,"These labels are a godsend for labeling and mailing things.  This 0.5' x 1.75' size is perfect for return addresses and small labels.  I prefer the 1' size for most things because of the larger size. but these work for smaller items.  I have used them to put my son's name on his school supplies. binders. etc. as well as for my things in the classroom like student names on cubbies. pencil cans. supplies in the storage cabinet.  Avery.com has templates that you can use and it does not take too much time to figure out how to print on them. so don't be scared.  2000 labels per package are just waiting for you!"
6,"While address labels may not be the most interesting thing I buy. getting good labels that are easy to print does matter to me.  And the Avery White Easy Peel Return Address Labels 8167 were exactly what I was looking for.They truly are. as advertised. easy to peel off the backing.  And they don't smudge after being printed. nor do they jam in the printer.But for me. perhaps the most important thing about labels is the ease of using the printing website.  I found the Avery site easy to use.The bottom line?  Five stars.  Easy to print and use and economical.  Win win win."
6,"Avery have literally set the standard for pre-cut adhesive peel-off labels and these are no different. Easy to remove from the backing (much easier than some other brands) and high quality paper and strong backing glue make these labels perfect for your label needs. I printed a bunch with a photo background and they look almost as good as a glossy print. Plus Avery always offers templates for the most used software packages (outlook. excel etc) so printing alignment and pre-filled info is handled for you so no need to perform multiple test prints before doing a proper print.It may seem like a simple thing to print onto labels but anyone who has used generic labels which don't conform to any standard will know just how many you can waste before everything is lined up. With Avery's labels the hard work is done for you and your labels will look perfect first time."
6,"As others have stated here. a label is a label is a label...right?  Not always.  There are many factors that I look at when buying labels. especially in quantity:1.  Price.  Big variances between 'generic' and 3M. Avery. etc.2.  Glue.  Good glue won't come through the label.3.  Adhesive Quality.  Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter). and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4.  Ease of removing from sheet.  If they are not easy to remove. the label can be easily torn.  Sometimes I've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value. and have the other characteristics of good labels.  Whenever I have a choice between an Avery label and another product (even at a much lower price) I buy the Avery."
6,"I use these exclusively as a return label set for my and for my parents who are getting old.  I print out a set every once in a while and I keep them on a clipboard.  Once a year I print out a few sets of these and mail them to my parents. whose eyes and arthritis make it a bit hard to do these things anymore and it's a tremendous help to them.  They are too small for the full address.I've also used them to label odd things.  Overall a great product.I will say that the easy peel adhesive works grreat on paper but don't try it on plastic.  I used them to label baby bottles and these did not peel off easily from plastic.  Magic on paper though."
6,"Avery has some of the best products. and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now. you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned. this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels. labels for kitchen items. yard sale price stickers. etc...."
6,"These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills. I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. I've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification."
6,"These are a replacement product for the 5167 labels many of us have used succesfully for years.  I can't honestly say I ever found peeling labels from a backing sheet to be particularly challenging so. as far I'm concerned. the Easy Peel designation is a marketing gimmick.  They work just fine in myBrother HL2270DW laser printer. once I learned to orient the top of the sheet to the front of the paper tray in this printer.  That's a change from all the HP printers I've used in the past and had me thinking the formatting was off in Avery's Design Pro software.  Once I figured it out. the labels and the software are just what I needed."
6,"Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case. packages or envelopes. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted. part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However. overall it's a fine product."
6,"You can't use these for anything except return labels because they are so small. Be sure to position them where you want them the first time because if you don't & try to remove them to place them better they will tear & stick partially to the envelope. These did not jam even running through 100 pages at a time to print on my Konica Minolta laser jet color printer. I loved the online FREE help for getting the temp plate made & they also enclosed a toll free number to call for FREE help.can't beat that. I gave them 3 stars because of the help available. other wise I would have given them one star. the paper itself is very cheap."
6,"After years of using an ink-jet printer. I finally bought an economical laser printer.  These laser labels are perfect for the kind of labels that I keep handy - a few dozen printed labels for each family member. and my own return labels.I had no problem running these through my Brother laser printer. using Word 2011 for Mac. template 5267.  Avery is always worth the extra money! Their quality is outstanding. and this product is no different.  The labels don't jam. they line up properly. and they peel easily.  In other words. they work well. and they don't annoy me when I go to use them. and that is something I look for in a product I pay a premium for.  Avery is my go-to for printer products -- worth the few extra cents (or even a dollar) because I know it will get the job done over the months the packet will be in my desk drawer."
6,"I just recently got my first laser printerBrother Printer HL2270DW Wireless Monochrome Printer(with which I am very happy. I find it works exponentially faster and more efficiently than ANY ink printer I have owned) and then these labels came up. which I thought was the perfect test for my new printer!Essentially. they print up great. and of course it will vary from printer to printer. but I didn't have any issues with these. smearing or getting caught or anything of the like.  If you are looking for return address labels for a laser printer. then these work extremely well. and are priced at the same as just about any other pack of address labels; they are worth it.  :)God Bless ~Amy"
6,"I've used this exact Avery label for years as our return address label.  I got this particular pack free through the Amazon Vine program in exchange for writing a review of the product.These labels are the perfect size for return addresses. and they are super easy to print using an Avery template or one that comes with your MSWord program. The adhesive is strong so they stay securely stuck to your envelopes.  The 'easy peel' part of the name means they peel easily off the backing sheet when you bend it.  With 2000 labels in each pack. you'll be all set to send out those bills. letters and Christmas cards."
6,"Return address labels save you time. and the Avery system is easier-to-use than many.These labels perform exactly as described. They feed perfectly. are perfectly spaced on the label sheet. are easy to peel and position. and they can be repositioned many times yet still stick firmly.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work:You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5267Type in what you want on the labeland Print.The label sheet even shows you which end to insert in your printer.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking return address labels."
6,"These are nice labels and will work for most purposed. However. for my application. I need to fed one sheet multiple times. as I use labels on items that I craft. Unfortunately. with these Avery labels. after I feed them a couple times. the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. I am using a HP laserjet. but I have had this problem before with the lower end labels. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So. if you plan to print one sheet at a time. this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time. look for another product."
6,"Belkin Wrist Pad is a great support for all people who spend lot of time working with their keyboards that will help your wrists and hands don't get tired so much.It's lightweight. very comfortable. ergonomic product and it's made asymmetrical that is great for me because position of hands during keyboard use isn't the same.The pad is filled with gel making it adjustable to your own hands thus providing great support.I like keyboard wrist pads that aren't combined with mouse pads because that allows user to combine position of keyboards and mouse in a way that is convenient to the user. but also making it suitable for both left-handers and right-handers.Since I use it for a month I cannot yet speak about its durability though it's looking like a lasting product that doesn't wear a lot during use.Overall. this Belkin Wrist Pad would be my first recommendation if you are searching for good wrists support being in front of the computer for a whole day."
6,"My wife was having soreness in her wrists that may have signaled the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome. I ordered the Belkin Wave Rest wrist pad. and since she started using it. the soreness has subsided. She loves the pad. It's about an inch wider than the keyboard she's using. so she doesn't have to move her hands off the pad. I've used it a few times. and I liked it enough that I may get one for myself.I think the wrist pad is worth trying for anyone who may be developing carpal tunnel syndrome or any related problem."
6,"The gel rest is comfortable.  However if you look at the picture closely. the pad is actually a bit thinner 4/3rd of the way to the left. I think the designer's ideal is to make the thickest part near the number pad on the right side..But the problem is that number pad is least used part of the keyboard. and when my hand rest on &#34;F&#34; and &#34;J&#34; key the right side gets a lot less coverage than the left side. and feel very unbalanced."
6,"I give these labels my highest recommendation as I like to recycle packaging (envelopes. boxes. plastic mailers) and they are sufficiently thick so that you only need one to cover up any addresses. codes. instructions that would ordinarily make it hard to reuse packaging. Even if you tend not to be a person who recycles. these will serve you well in case you need to return a purchase using the same package that it came in.Easy to peel and can be used for addressing using computer software or just as good to peel off and write over them by hand. Priced reasonably and there is little else to say about 'labels.' If you need them. these are as good as it gets for the reasons highlighted above.If you use labels exclusively for mailings on new envelopes. you might be able to save a few dollars and buy another Avery product that has more labels for a similar price."
6,"My HP 460 inkjet printer can print on these without any problems.  The pages feed into the printer smoothly and the ink doesn't smudge after printing.  Avery also provides plenty of software templates on their website for you to use.  Just go to [...] and search for 5163 (this information is on the label packaging too).  They provide many premade label designs in Word Doc format and blank templates for other applications like InDesign and Photoshop.  Also. the TrueBlock feature really does block out everything behind the label. which is great when you're reusing old boxes for shipping.  Overall. I'm very happy with these labels."
6,"I used these for two reasons - to print addresses for shipping padded envelopes and to help label and organize my bathroom closet.They were perfect for both.The address labels were printed on an inkjet printer which I thought would smear but they came out fine. I used the standard paper setting and didn't have to fiddle with the gloss or stock weight settings at all. The colors looked nice on there. too. They were affixed to those brown padded envelopes and they stuck on really well. They are sticky and re-positionable but ONLY if you pull it off very quickly. Great size - fit full addresses with room to spare.Then. I used a Sharpie to write names on the stickers to match up with the little organization bins I have in my bathroom closet and that worked great. too. The sharpie marker looks fantastic on the matte surface.I will use these again!"
6,"I received this through the Amazon vine program.  These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label.  The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it.  I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
6,"These labels from Avery work pretty much as advertised.  The dark gray backing does an excellent job of covering up whatever is underneath the label.  The size is perfect for packages. and they don't smudge easily.  I just wish the adhesive was a little bit stronger.  These labels can be peeled off without much effort. which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box. but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and can't be removed.  An easy solution (though perhaps not very elegant) is to cover the label with clear packing tape.Overall I like these labels. and I think the price is reasonable.  Perhaps in the future Avery will come out with an extra-strong/permanent version of these. which I would gladly give five stars."
6,"There are a lot of options when it comes to labels and it can be hard to pick one that is best.  Although placing a normal label on a surface with writing covers most of it up. these ensure that it does.  I tested several and they do work well.  These labels are great for packages and are the type I use most often.As for the stickiness of these labels. I would say they are about average.  They are probably not going to fall off in transit. but can peel off mostly clean or completely clean on the surface they were attached to.  Overall. these are good labels. but there isn't a whole lot of difference between them and others."
6,"These are general use return address/locate labels. 2 inch by 4 inches.  I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers. so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website. And. of course. Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning. so you can not loose buying these.  And the TrueBlock really works.  I took one of the blank labels and pasted it on the dark blue folder the lables come in.  No blue shows through. it is pure white.."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
6,"Do you ever get tired of writing out all the information onto an envelope?  Me too. so I decided to get with the 20th century (I know its now the 21st century) and print out labels.  It was so easy. that I started labeling everything from which tools should be in what drawer of the toolbox to what items are missing from the shelves at work for re-order.  This is great.  Wish I had done this sooner.  As for the brand of labels themselves. they seem to be very high quality but time will tell."
6,"Avery consistently pumps out quality products and the base things you can expect from their labels hold true here: no smudging. ease of setup.good adhesive.  The added feature (although not very new. but new to me) is the Easy Peel feature.  As the product copy says. 'Columns can be separated to expose label edges for easier. faster peeling'.  That about sums it up.  No more folding back and prying.  If you save a second per label peeling. that's a few minutes saved on a good sized Christmas card mailing!  Anything that makes things easier in a 'commodity' product warrants a five-star rating in my book."
6,"This product works as advertised. Avery has been in the label business a long time. and knows how to specialize. They make affordable labels. The most difficult part for me in using labels made for a printer is setting up the program that has the addresses on them. Word makes this a little easier. Once this is accomplished. the labels can be put in the printer. printer settings changed to accept them. and you have printed address labels. Much quicker than doing this by hand. and they look so much better!"
6,"These easy peel labels ARE easy!  I also like the free cute templates on the avery.com/templates website.  I chose a coffee grinder and also a bee motif.  They are adorable and easy to use too.  I didn't have any problems with bleeding. and the bee had several colors all over the label.They are great for Christmas cards or any other mass mailing. since the paper backing is perforated and you can tear it away so the labels hang off the end a little.  I think they are sticky enough for everyday mailing on regular envelopes. and I print them up ahead of time to have on hand for bills and cards and things.They are a great price and don't loose their stick. I think they are great!  Will definitely recommend them."
6,"I used my entire package of these up already and have purchased these in the past several times last year to create labels for my classroom library.  They align well. the ink doesn't smudge once it dries a bit. and they adhere well.  After spending hours designing classroom bin and book labels. I want labels that can stand up to 2nd graders.  And my 2nd graders love to read.  I only had one label come off (in a year) and it had to do with someone picking at it after it got wet and became smudged.  While these are a bit more than the store brand in those big box stores. I'd rather spend a bit more and have a product work."
6,"I can always depend on Avery to give me a quality product.  These little labels are what we use the most in our household.  They are handy for everything.  We use them with the free downloadable templates from their website so they are positioned accurately and look crisp and professional.  You can just print one or a whole sheet... and now the directions are right on the back of each sheet. very handy.  If you collect boxtops for education. they are cleary displayed in an area that can easily be cut out without disturbing the contents.No jamming. yet each individual label is easier to pick up without dislodging the outside border.  No problems.Highly recommended quality product."
6,"Haven't used Avery labels for quite some time; however. since i recently became treasurer of our HOA. it's my duty to mail dues requests twice a year - labeling envelopes is never fun. but decided to try these labels... in the past. picking the label off the sheet was a wearisome. repetitive task... but now. with Avery's redesign of its label sheets. a quick two folds of the printed sheet of labels. and label edges pop up - making the job of peel-and-place a *lot* easier! Good job. Avery!"
6,"Although I have had the opportunity to use other brands through the Vine program. I am still very pleased with the price and performance of the Avery brand of labels.  I have never had an issue with these labels smudging or jamming in my laser printer.  I use these not only for address labels. but also for frequently used notes on packages (e.g. Fragile) and to label file folder boxes as well.  The templates to use create the data for the labels are included with Microsoft Word and make easy work out of getting them printed properly."
6,"As address labels these do everything you'd expect them to do - you can print names and addresses on your printer. peel them off easily. and stick securey to envelopes. If your wordprocessor doesn't have a template for them. one can be downloaded from [...].However I also used these labels for another purpose - organziing several closets. No longer do I have to remember which sheld the fitted king sized sheets are on and which is the fitted queen sheets - just print out what you need on these labels. stick them to the front of the shelves. and you're done. (Just use a nice large readable font). I reorganized the linen closet. hall closet. and basement closet using them and I couldn't be happier."
6,"These labels work perfectly.  Labels are such a time and effort saver. and they are so versatile; there are so many things you can do with them.  I can't imagine living in a world without labels.  These particular ones are for laser printers. but they can also be used just for writing on.  They are easy to peel.  They are address labels. but you can use them for a variety of different reasons.  These labels are really awesome.Convenient. practical. good quality. and they make life easier.  These labels can do so many things and you can use them for so many reasons - the list is endless.Highly recommended for office. home. school. workshop. playroom. etc. - the list is endless."
6,"and yes. they are easy to peel off. haven't caused a printer jam. print nicely and sticks well. i don't know what the difference is between the 5160 and 5260 because they seem to be the same size. from what i can tell. the only difference seems to be that the 5160 comes in a much larger pack (3000 labels) than the 5260 (750 labels). so if you're in need of many more labels than 750. i'd buy the 5160 instead of multiple packs of 5260. but for casual home users who don't want 3000 labels (that's 100 sheets of labels - it's a lot). the 5260 would be a better choice even though you spend more per label - buying in excess is more wasteful than paying for a smaller pack."
6,"Avery makes some really great products.  It's certainly a name you can trust.  These labels work great for my needs.  I also love the available downloads from the Avery website.  I've had nothing but a pleasant experience with this item and getting the job done.The price seems to be pretty reasonable.  I would also like to add that the price on Amazon is. I think. a little bit cheaper than what I have paid in the past at a couple of different office supply stores (not to mention any names)."
6,"Side-by-side comparison:3M Address Labelsare just as good. and usually less expensive. Go for the better price.I've used Avery and 3M labels for years.The 3M have the same easy-peel layout. without the laughable salesmanship.The 3M package claims 'Permanent Adhesive' and 'Strong Stick.' The Avery stick just as well. or almost as wellI find the 1' x 2-5/8' size is big enough if you use size 9 font (Arial). I get up to 38 characters per line x 5 lines."
6,"Another effective Avery office product that's relatively easy to use. Works fine with our home(Panasonic) and office(HP) laser printers (I didn't bother trying the labels with our ink-jet printers).  Avery provides FREE templates for Microsoft Word and also their own Design and Print Online.  It was easy to print out address labels for our clients.  Just make sure the printing is aligned properly with the labels.  The Pop-up Edge feature ensures effortles peeling of the labels.  There were no smudging.  Avery has kept it simple and useful."
6,"These are easy to use and I only had to use 2 sheets of plain paper to get them aligned. It works fine with my cannon printer but I prefer to put them in 1 at a time. I didn't have a problem with these but I one had a problem with the printer taking more than one sheet then it wanted to jam.I like the size they are big enough to clearly see the address but not too big to take up too much space.I several pages with return addresses and I will save some for addressing envelopes at Christmas time."
6,"If you are accustomed to office store brand labels which are simply incised through the top layer of peel-and-stick paper. you are in for a pleasant surprise with these labels from Avery. The user only needs to bend the paper at each vertical row and the labels stick up on the ends for easy removal. These are also comparably priced to the office store brands in a similar quantity. So given the choice. buying these more convenient to use labels is a no brainer. At this writing. though. I could not find these in large quantities. so the office store brands can still beat these in price in large quantities. Nevertheless. I recommend these and feel the ease of use saves enough time to warrant additional expense for larger quantities."
6,"Avery is a brand that has been doing laser labels for as long as I can remember and they put out a very nice product.  This particular size. the 5260 is the perfect size for address labels for envelopes.  Three columns. ten long means you get 30 labels to a sheet.Easy peel off. easy printing with no jams.  The perfect label.The nice thing about Avery is that it works seamlessly with Microsoft Office.  In word they have templates for all the Avery laser labels and you just have to select which one you are using and the blank template just pops up.  Sometimes with generic brands. this is not the case and you have to manually set your parameters which while doable for a regular MS Word user could prove to be quite an obstacle for the casual user.I highly recommend these labels to anyone.  They will not give you trouble."
6,"I have been using Avery mailing labels for quite a while. I was successfully printing addresses on Avery 8160 labels in both ink jet and laser printers. so I was puzzled when I found the Avery 5260 labels designed specifically for laser printers. The only difference I detected is the strip of label paper along the left edge of the page of labels. I suppose this helps prevent jamming in laser printers. but I never experienced jamming with the 8160 nor 5260 labels.I have switched to laser printing exclusively because the cost per page is so much lower with the lasers printers and the ink never smudges once it leaves the fuser.The bottom line on this is. I will probably continue buying the Avery 5260 labels."
6,"Overall these are very good labels and my complaint doesn't really count since they directions say not to run the sheet of labels through the printer more then once. but I do.  With the easy peel labels the sheet tends to get stuck a little more in the printer then before. but it's not a ton.  And I reuse sheets because really. I'm not wasting a whole sheet for 2 or 3 addresses!  Besides that I've never had a problem with these labels smudging or not sticking. I've always been pleased with Avery labels."
6,"I don't know how Avery continues to improve on products that seem to work so well. but they manage to find ways to tweak their labels to make them even easier to use.These labels work as promised - no jamming in my printer. the print is legible and clean. and the labels peel off like magic. I've used Avery products for years and I'm never disappointed. These labels are no exception. They zip out of my printer in a jiffy. and the labels are great to use on all sorts of packaging. I ship a lot of things in the craft bubble mailers. and these labels stick like a charm."
6,"This is yet another great label product by Avery.  Of course it works with Avery's DesignPro template software.  I used these in a HP LaserJet printer and had no issues with smudging--all the print was clear.  The only thing I did not like was the pop-up edge for fast peeling.  It works great if you print a full sheet of labels each time. but occasionally I only need to print a few labels and when the sheet goes through the printer a few times it can start to separate easily.  Not a big deal. just something to be aware of if you only print a few labels at a time.  I would recommend these labels and I would buy them again!"
6,"Yes. these labels are just as they are described. but even better than I expected.From past experience with printing labels. I figured I'd have to spoil a few sheets to 'get the system zeroed-in.'I was wrong.  I clicked on my label options. selected the appropriate Avery label number. and voila! printed my first sheet of labels--which were perfect.As they advertise. the labels are also extremely easy to peel. so I'm very pleased and will reorder these labels again and again."
6,"Make note that this product is for laser printers!  Great product for office or at home use.  If you have a mass mailing to do. you will find Avery templates and labels extremely useful.  These products come with Easy Peel technology to make sticking the labels on envelopes even easier.  Anytime you have to print labels. look to these Avery labels.  A good value for your money.  You can address 750 envelopes with just one package.  Do you know how much time mail merge. a printer. and some avery labels will save you.  You won't be disappointed!"
6,"Avery has done it again!  Been using their product for years and I think these are a good improvement over prior functionality.I did use the template and verified that the printing surfaces were clean and ready to go prior to use.  In this way. the labels printed smoothly and easily.  There was not smudging.  The labels did not get stuck in the printer.As the sheet includes just labels (no margins). they peeled off easily and could be subsequently appliedquickly and neatly to the envelopes.  The finished look was neat and very professional and ready for mailing.Overall.  these are terrific  address labels for any user."
6,"I use labels on a regular basis. be it in the office or at home.  My number one brand of choice is always Avery.  Now Avery has enhanced the labels by making them smudge proof and easy to peel.  When ever I have a big job and have to peel over 100 labels...you better believe I want a label that can peel easily and quickly and this product delivers just what I want.  Some may think a label is just a label. but not so.  If you want the best of the best. buy Avery."
6,"Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec. you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers. 1 x 2-5/8 Inches. Box of 3000 Labels (5160). The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you ' Pop-up Edge for fast peeling'. I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it."
6,"I do catalog mailings about once a month at work. we're a small company so I do the job from start to finish. stuffing and sealing envelopes. printing labels. attaching labels and running postage.The two things that take the longest in this process are stuffing the envelopes and peeling the labels to stick on the envelopes. This product doesn't solve both of these. but it sure takes care of one of them! These labels worked flawlessly in our printer. then just bend the backing and the edges of each label are there and ready to be peeled.Cut my labeling time nearly in half!I was a bit concerned that 'easy peel' would mean 'not sticky'. but the labels adhered nicely to the envelopes. with no corner lifting at all.Great product!"
6,"These are good. standard solid labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used both the 3M version. Avery version. and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose. I'd make your decision based on price. and features such as the Easy Peel (which makes using a LOT of these go much faster - think Christmas card mailings. wedding/shower invitations. etc)...as well as other features like (is it for a LASER or INKJET) printer?  Is it the right adhesive (does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using)...I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands. but Avery has been making good labels for a long time. so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process!"
6,"These 1' x 2 5/8' labels have many uses. I've been using them for quite a while. and they've always performed perfectly. They stick well and they don't smudge.Also. although Avery says that each sheet should only go through a printer once. who works like that? I've done sheets printing one label at a time. with no problems at all. If you do that. I'd recommend starting with the bottom row of labels and working your way up. Of course. your laser printers might be different from mine. so your mileage might vary.The labels now have a 'Pop-up Edge' for easy peeling. but I haven't used it. since I usually print one label at a time. The pop-up edge facilitates peeling of an entire column of labels at once. However. I've never had the slightest bit of trouble peeling labels off individually.They are excellent labels. and Avery offers software and/or templates to make it easy to print on them."
6,"I use these Note Card sheets for printing all my greeting cards.  For Christmas cards. thank you cards. get well cards. etc... I subscribe to a greeting card membership that allows me to make my own cards... to edit the verses. and to even modify the designs. I use these ALL THE TIME for all my cards. They are great. I have both size sheets to make the 4' x 5' cards and to make the larger cards of 5' x 8'. Amazon supplies me with the material. and I make the cards.. it is FUN and I even get to add my name to the cards too. Avery is the best product for making cards.  Their paper is QUALITY and Avery makes ALL types of paper to print your cards on...Thank you Avery and thank you Amazon."
6,"These are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose - Thank You. Invitation. X-mas cards etc. etc. Although the box says that they are for inkjet printers. I have used them in Dell. Brother & Samsung laser printers without any problem.But I did need to download the template from the Microsoft Office web site. The template also works for iWork & Pages in Mac - just open the template from the File menu in Pages. Then I found out that Avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site. The software is DesignPro for Mac and Wizard for Microsoft Office on Windows and is available for free download at Avery web site. As of July each card and envelope comes to about 28 cents a card. Not bad.Bottom line - good product. saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card."
6,"DYMO brand labels are more expensive than generic labels. A lot more expensive sometimes. However. I burned through 2 DYMO label printers with inferior generic brand labels. They got the machine jammed up and caused the entire machine to burn out and fail. Generic labels caused me a big headache and lost money and time. I still like my DYMO printer. but I learned my lesson the hard way. Spend the extra money on DYMO brand labels. Yes. they are probably charging a little too much. but it is what is. The labels are high quality and won't ruin your printer."
6,"I've long been a fan of Avery products. Every time I buy an off-brand just to save a few cents. I always end up with paper jams or unusable smudged. smeared. or incorrectly placed labels. Avery products are always well-made and supported by every device that I use in my office. The Avery File Folder Labels are no exception.Speaking of software and formats. even if the program you have doesn't support Avery (I can't imagine which one that would be...) you can go to their website and download templates or even use their website to print! (This one is great because our office includes not only PC's but also several Linux machines).Lastly. I was happily surprised to see the inclusion of 2 'Box Tops'. My children's school does an excellent job of collecting these and turning them in. It is nice to finally see these great incentives on products other than snack food.When is a label not just another label? When it's an Avery label! :)"
6,"I recently went through my filing cabinet and purged all of the old crap that was cluttering the drawers.  The problem is that I now had a stack of very usable folders that were 'tattooed' by the old labels.  You can't tear the old labels off without damaging the tab and if you put new labels over them the writing on the old label shows through.These new Avery File Folder Labels are absolutely perfect for this situation: you can place them over old labels and they completely block out the writing on the old labels.  Problem solved!!Nice and heavy-duty. these are excellent labels.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day. so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say. Hi!') feel free to post it below.Thanks.Claire"
6,"The folder labels are fine. but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD). but when you print or go to print preview. you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label. particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution. but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out."
6,"One of my summer projects was to file. re-file. and re-organize existing files. Not the most pleasant task in the world. One of the things I wanted to avoid this time around was my messy hand written tab titles for the hanging folders.Voila!These Avery computer generated tab title thing-a-me-bobs are exactly what was needed! Download the template. type the titles. print out and attach- couldn't be easier.I love it when simple products perform their designated task well and make my life just a little bit easier."
6,"The TrueBlock technology works really well.  I had some folders with old labels that I had written on with Sharpies and ballpoint pen.  I have tried using other labels to cover the old writing. but I could always see through them - especially the labels that I had written on with marker.  These folder labels blocked out the old writing completely.Avery's website also has some really nice free online tools to create quick templates for printing labels - no downloads required.  I used the 'Design and Print Online' feature to create a sheet of labels on my MacBook. then I printed the sheet on my Brother laser printer.  It worked really well.  It took me less than 5 minutes to get my labels typed in. choose a font. and get them printed using the manual sheet feeder on my printer.  It was impressively easy."
6,"As a teacher. you quickly learn how to recycle and reuse anything you can get your hands on.  This is a great way to reuse file folders.  With the True Block Technology. you can make a folder look practically new.  The labels underneath don't show through.  Of course you can use Avery's templates with this labels.  What could make it any greater?  They can be used on both Inkjet and Laser Printer.  How many times have you bought printer labels only to discover they aren't for your printer?  They even come with 2 Box Tops for Education.  Gotta love that!  Avery has done it.  The perfect label.  You are going to find a million uses for these File Folder Labels."
6,"I've purchased other 'no bleed-through' labels from office supply stores and found that they fall flat on their claims. When I heard these labels were suppose to stop bleed-through. I bought a pack of folders to go with it. figuring it wouldn't work as advertised and I'd end up tossing some old files. I was shocked when they actually covered up the DARK writing underneath. I often use a very thick. black marker for writing on some folders. and these labels didn't allow the original writing to bleed through at all. Very impressive."
6,"If you are resusing old file folder these are the absolute best.  There is NO bleed through of whatever is written behind it. even if written in dark black sharpie.The labels have some sort of coating on the back that really does block everything out.You can quickly find a template in Word by typing in 8366 in the search box after you do 'File' 'New'.When using these templates I always select the whole document and have the edges of the cells of the tables filled in so that I can tell where the edge of the label is while typing ( In Word 2007 this is under the Home tab in the Paragraph section. it looks like a little 4 square box with the bottom underlined).  Chose 'All borders'.  You can then go back and Chose 'No borders' when done if you do not want the borders printed."
6,"If you need a label where you don't want the background to show. then then these lables are for you.  Believe it or not. I use these labels for my home brew beer bottles.  With a clear label I can make a custom made label on my carefully crafted home brew that makes me look like a brewing professional.  No more white background on my beer bottles.  No sir - now my beer bottles look professional.  Kidding aside I love these clear labels and recommend them to those who wish to hide the background."
6,"I've been using Avery labels for years. primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE. it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels. so once you find 8660. enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear. which would especially be useful when using high quality paper. such as sending out wedding invitations."
6,"I love these clear labels- Avery is always top-notch. Printing on them is easy- Avery's site provides four ways that you can design and print the labels. I used the 'Avery Design and Print Online'- no downloads required. You can also download the templates to use in Word or on other programs. Anyway. Avery online has lots of designs and it's simple to use. so all I had to do was type in my address and print the labels. They dry right away and the print did not smear at all. Highly recommended product!"
6,"Overall. I'm very satisfied with these.  I originally had thought I'd use them for individual labeling of mail. however. my software doesn't allow for single print of labels.  So. I initially wasted an entire sheet when the address printed on all the labels.So. I've gone to using them for my return labels.  I use a Canon M83 color printer and they come out just fine.  I will say that 'virtually disappear' is a pretty big stretch...to me the labels are still very visible even though they are clear."
6,"The Avery easy peel labels are a great way to print out formal invitations.  The clear labels are wonderful for giving your envelopes the appearance of being stamped or printed on without the cost.  The software download allows you to easily print full sheets of labels from Microsoft Office products with a variety of fonts for a unique formal appearance.  In the past one of the big flaws with these labels was the difficulty of trying to peel them off of the sheet (especially when you have dozens of labels to peel!).  These new labels have an 'easy peel' design which makes it much easier and faster to peel off the sheet.  Overall this a great product for anyone needing to mail a large quantity of letters or invitations.*** Positive Points: ***- Great results from a variety of inkjet printers (I used an Epson Artrisan 810 and HP inkjet printer)- New easy peel design really does work- Looks great on formal invitations or letters*** Negative Points: ***- None"
6,"Avery labels haven't let me down for all the years I've been using them.  Besides the obvious return labels. I've used them for labelling water pipes in the basement. birthday party gift bags. folders.  They stick well. print well. and are templates for various printing softwares (I've been a PrintShop user for a very long time. occasionally use Microsoft Word. and use Avery DesignPro5).  DH redid the pipes in the basement 10 years ago and figured it would be best to label them right off the bat. direction. hot or cold. where to. so I did some up in PrintShop.  They haven't fallen off. they haven't faded.  We also have a hub of cable wires that needed labelling. and Avery did that job as well.  Many uses for me. besides the obvious."
6,"The labels are semi-transparent white on the sheet. but clear once adhered to the surface.  The dilemma I always have with these types of labels is that I just want to print one or a small handful. but the sheet has 30 and I don't want to waste the rest.  One reviewer had a good suggestion to tape a piece of paper over the labels that you don't want to use up.  I find that sometimes if I don't do this carefully it will jam the printer.  So another trick that I discovered is:1. Make a layout in the software for a small number of labels.2. Print onto a blank sheet of paper.3. Put the Avery labels over the printed test sheet. hold up to a strong light source. and see how it lines up.4. Make adjustments in the software for the alignment. repeat steps 2-4.5. Print to the Avery sheet."
6,"Seems we never have enough labels around here. between sending out invitations to one party or another or my new writer sending cards to family (I like to print out sheets of addresses she can easily put on an envelope by herself whens he has a letter ready to mail since she's only 6 and sometimes her writing can be a bit hard to read this way she can put one on and an envelope with a stamp and put it in the mail box herself. this has greatly increased her reading and writing by being penpals with all our out of state relatives). My daughter also loves to make her own stickers. when she was smaller the white labels worked fine but now that she's older she doesn't want everything to have a white rectangle around it and these clear labels are perfect. she can use colorful gel pens and draw her little images and then when she puts her 'sticker' on something only her drawing shows! They print wonderfully in my canon printer and line up just perfectly. Great purchase!"
6,"I received these labels and the first thing I did was print out a page of address labels with my own information on them to test the quality. The printer was able to feed the label paper through the printer with no issues. Printing in economy wasn't the best idea as it was faint. I reprinted the labels using standard ink quality and everything came out perfect. Text was centered on the labels as it should be. no jams. no label's peeling off in the printer. These work well.I actually used another version of this label a few years back on my wedding invitations to create custom return address labels and saved a ton of money over ordering custom labels from some company. These labels match the quality and I could easily recommend using these for anything from mailing bills to mailing wedding invitations. they do a great job and the quality of the label is really good."
6,"For the past five years Avery's clear address labels have been my preferred label for all my address label needs.  I like them because they're clear and can be put on any color envelope and not stick out like a sore thumb.  Printing on these labels is a snap.  I've never had any issues with them not printing nicely or getting stuck in the printer.  The new easy peel feature is a nice addition.  By simply bending back a column of the sheet you can easily access the edge of all the labels in the column for easy peeling and application.These labels can be used for more than just mailing.  We've used them to label plastic containers and school projects."
6,"I would give these a 4.5 rating if I could.  The lost half point is because I too often think that I printed out my labels wrong because of the little extra bit provided to make the peel off easier.  This part stays behind on the sheet.  Unless I look real close. I can't tell if I printed the labels right or not.  If I used these all the time. I'm sure this would stop being an issue. as I would adjust to it.Aside from the little side thing. these labels are great!  Easy to use. look amazing & professional thanks to being clear.  They stick really good.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.Recommended!"
6,"I use several types of labels when mailing. shipping or just labeling items. These I use for printing out mailing labels. labeling household items and as easy to write on folder labels. They leave a neater appearance than colored labels. I don't find that I crinkle the remaining labels on the page like others have commented on. They have a nice look and the ink does not smudge when I put the printed labels on anything. The labels do the job that they were intended to do. They are also good for using to tape things that might require a stronger connection than regular tape can give and they release easier than tape because of their thickness."
6,"I often buy colored envelopes because I think they look so nice when you get them in a stack of mostly white mail. But if you want to use labels. the white rectangles look so ugly. These are perfect! I find they don't stick quite as well as the white ones. but never had one come off and get returned.They don't really help with dark colored paper (including most reds) because the black ink doesn't stand out enough). but for pastels or off whites. they are beautiful."
6,"She said:The ability to remove a single label from the sheet is absolutely wonderful.  The sheet then goes back through the printer without a problem. so you can print one label or a few labels as needed without waste.The tooth works perfectly on inkjet printers.  You can print inkjet lapels in color or black and white and they come out as well as the printer is capable of producing an ink output.But the best thing that the labels have is exactly what they advertise. the 'Easy Peel'.  Peel one label off a sheet. and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition."
6,"So...my sister decided that she didn't want to hand address 200+ wedding invitations.  There clear labels worked well for the invitations and didn't look at office like.  They printed without jamming in both the manual and auto feed trays of my Canon inkjet printer.  The ink also didn't smear when you touched it immediately after printing. however it will smear if it gets wet but is still legible.  The easy peel feature was nice. but then again I've never had an issue peeling address labels off a sheet before. and I usually fold the normal sheets along the edge just like you are instructed to do with the easy peel sheets."
6,"These clear. matte finish labels from Avery work great in my HP 1610 inkjet printer.  Text comes out crisp and clear.  I do recommend letting them dry for a while before handling them. as with anything else you print.  These are not crystal clear. nor are they glossy. but they are clear enough that if you're putting them on a colored envelope. the color will show through.  I like the matte finish because it makes the label blend in with the paper. almost to the point that it looks like the text is printed directly on the paper.I downloaded the template from Avery's web site.  It's in Microsoft Word format but it works flawlessly with OpenOffice."
6,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects. particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface. making sure to burnish the labelssecurely. then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design.and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly. as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool. but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course.this is only one idea. but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
6,"The following is my fianc&eacute;e's review of the labels.My fianc&eacute; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding.  We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels.  It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels.  When they printed out. they looked really good.  There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center.  I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer.  I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay.  About three out of 100 labels were messed up.  I recommend these labels.  I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates.  When I put them on the postcards. they looked really good =)"
6,"I have had negative experiences with 'generic' printable labels in the past...specifically. with the sheet getting stuck in my ink jet printer.  I have had no problems at all with these Avery labels. They go through the printer smoothly. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.  I have also used these same labels in the white version. which work equally well.  However. for purely aesthetic reasons. I prefer the clear labels.If you go online to the Avery website. there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking."
6,"This size of address label has many uses.  Of course. they can be used for addresses on packages and envelopes. but also as identification labels.  I printed a sheet with my name. address and phone number to attach to things I take on vacation.  The print on my inkjet printer was clean and crisp. the ink dried quickly (no smudging). the labels indeed do peel easily and I like the translucent background that works with many surfaces.  Word 2010 had the format in its list of labels and each label was perfectly aligned.  You can also download free templates from Avery's web site."
6,"The main reason I like these labels:  1.  Easy to use with my software programs.  2.  Print out perfect!  3.  Was able to put a clip art on them.  4.  Last reason but the best of all.  They peel off so very easy. I have to add that the Avery Labels have found so many uses from address labels.for file folders.  recipe headings. journaling. labeling totes and I'm sure I will find other places to use them.  I haven't found anything negative about these labels and usually I don't like using them because they are hard to peel off."
6,"Avery always makes great labels and gives you the best templates and software to go with them. so it's no surprise that I'm very pleased with their clear easy-peel address labels. The healthy 1' x 2 5/8' size allows for plenty of font choices.I use tan parchment-colored envelopes for my business and slapping a white label on them gives a second-class mail look.  The clear labels impart a more professional appearance. and while I don't know it to be a fact. I think recipients are far more likely to pay attention.Finally. the easy peel feature prevents both frustration and inappropriate words in the office. Highly recommended."
6,"Avery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Clear label gives any envelope a professional look.  It is of the standard address size. but can be used to label items such as dvds. boxes. etc.  I prefer the clear labels to others. as they give a neat effect on birthday card envelopes.  I actually use the clear shipping ones for this purpose.  My word processsor. which is Word Perfect. includes a template for this label. Avery makes quality labels. and you can't go wrong with these."
6,"We bought these to use on our save-the-date cards and wedding invitations. and they worked out great. Just the right size for regular envelopes. and the look was exactly what we were going for.One suggestion - if you're not using the whole page of labels. and want to use the remaining labels later. take a piece of white paper. and tape it over the labels you are not using. The labels get darker every time you run them through the printer. It's hard to notice on the page. but once you affix them to the envelope. they can look a bit dirty."
6,"I bought this photo paper when I was in search of some more photo paper to print out my pictures at home and after looking around I came upon this photo paper from Epson. I had actually recently bought an Epson Workforce 845. so I decide to try the Epson paper as well. In simple words. this is very high quality paper that I would recommend for your 4x6 printing at home. It obviously isn't going to be the &#34;best&#34; . but for the price you definitely can't go wrong. I will be purchasing more of this photo paper in the future as it nice photo paper."
6,"We bought a dedicated photo printer for our preschool.  Epson XP-600.  It was smallish and held photo paper in its trays.  It took us a while to dial in on the right paper for the Airprint from our iOS devices.  This Premium paper did the trick.  Ultra Premium was too shiny and did not look right.  Kodak and HP paper did not work at all.  Neither did the cheaper stuff.  When the price is right here on Amazon. stock up!!!"
6,"What you have here is a quality. reliable phone.  While it's not like the updated models you see today. it serves its purpose. and serves its purpose quite well.  When it comes down to it. no matter what kind of fancy phone you see in the world today. you're still basically typing numbers in *just* to talk to someone.  This is why ANY phone will do.  The size. comfort and everything else doesn't matter when it comes down to it.  Don't even get me started on 'ring tones'.  Geez.As long as the numbers work and the signal is clear. who cares?  The AT&T; phone is exactly what you should buy.  It's a good old phone."
6,"The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house. shop. and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (likeBelkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which. although limited. does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is 'backlit' and draws power directly from the phone line. allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial. we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH"
6,"I bought this on Amazon because of the price for my replacement land line.  it is a good phone and it has a good sound to it.  it is not tinny in my ear as some phones are.  Let's face it. it's only a matter of time until the land line phone is history along with the phone book so I wasn't spending a lot of money on it.  The ringer is nice and not annoying as some are.  I am happy with my purchase."
6,"I've loved the trimline phone ever since I got my first phone more than 20 years ago.  Then. the trimline was a real. Bell System. telephone.  Although this phone is clearly not the same as the real Bell trimline phones. it still has the great. comfortable design and the dialpad in the handset. which makes it an excellent choice.  I've compared several other trimline phones and this is the closest phone I could find to the original Bell phones.Northwestern Bell also makes a trimline phone. but the quality and comfort are nowhere near this AT&T; version.If you read the other reviews. you will see that at least one review (dated November of 2004) says that this phone was discontinued.  Yet. here we are in late November 2004. and its still around.  I'm guessing (could be wrong here) that this phone will be around forever. even though AT&T; no longer promotes it on their web-site."
6,"We like to keep one non-electric phone in the house in case power goes out.  We have learned that during hurricanes. earthquakes and even big power failures that sometimes even cell phones don't work but these non-electric phones that plug right into the telephone outlet work when other things don't -that is if your phone service is not from the cable company but driectly from the telephone company. In regular day-today activies we use only cordless and cell phones but they can be useless in an emergency so we like the safety of having one phone like this.  This is fine little phone and the price as great."
6,"Does the job and not too flimsy. However. like many lightweight phones. easy to pull off a table when the handset cord gets twisted. If you rely on just your cordless phones. you are making a mistake. During a power failure. you will not be able to use landline service.I use this on one side of a King bed and a cordless on the other.  We have lots of short term outages here. but last week we were out 3+ days after an ice storm. Most landline service will continue to work for a few days during power failures. but you need a hardwired phone at home. This is an inexpensive way to go."
6,"No caller id. no bells and whistles.  This is a basic solid well made phone.  Buttons are large and easy to press.  Has 3 speed dials and 10 memory locations.  Last number redial. Tone/pulse switchable.  One drawback -- you CANNOT program a 'pause' if you need to dial '9' for an outside line; not a big deal. but you should be aware of that.The phone works very well.  I hear clearly and the people hear me clearly.  The handset is large and that makes it easy to hold.  You can also easily attach a shoulder cushion for holding the phone on your shoulder.  The handset is a tad heavy so I wouldn't use it for hour long calls. but it's perfect for extensions.  And it works in a power failure without batteries.For 10 bucks no one should complain about this phone."
6,"We ordered this a while ago and have only really used it now that the holidays are in full gear.  This is very impressive tape.  It does exactly what it says it does.  It virtually disappears once you put it on wrapping paper.  After I wrapped some presents for my office party. I asked my two young sons to look for the tape.  They only found it by pressing down on the package and feeling for the tape edge.  Pretty impressive!  In addition to this. it is strong.  As with all scotch tape. once you put it down it really holds paper in place.  Overall. this is a very impressive product that does exactly what it was created to do.  Thus. five stars."
6,"The satin finish is supposed to make this more invisible than regular 'Magic' tape when used on gift wrap.  To my eyes. there is almost no difference.  So the only reason to get this is if the price is better than regular 'Magic' tape.  As I write this review. it is!To be clear. there's nothing WRONG with this tape.  It works just as well as regular 'Magic' tape.  It's very hard to see when applied.  And. I assume. it'll have the same remarkable durability as regular 'Magic' tape.  It's just that it's special feature (satin finish. more invisible on gift wrap) doesn't work."
6,"I was skeptical that I would see a difference with this tape compared to regular Scotch tape. so I wrapped two presents: one in regular Scotch tape and one in this Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.The first difference is that the Gift Wrap Tape seems to be slightly more heavy duty. After wrapping. it is also clear that the gift wrap tape was less cloudy and did indeed look better than the present wrapped in regular tape. I wouldn't say that the difference was dramatic. but it was enough.So overall. as long as there is not much of a price difference I would definitely say go with the Gift Wrap Tape in situations where you want whatever you are taping to look nice."
6,"3M is probably one of the most innovative companies in the world.  They can take one product and make a thousand slightly different corresponding products from that base product.  They have done that again with the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.  When you compare it to the standard tape with a non-gloss finish. this tape blends into the packaging material better than the standard.  It gives a nice look that basically hides the tape from a distance.There are two negatives that I noticed:  The tensile strength is slightly higher thus it makes it slightly more difficult to tear.  It also seems to roll up on me with longer strips than the older standard version.  Therefore the 4 stars."
6,". . . and it does what it is supposed to do.  I just went through two rolls wrapping gifts -- and it seems a little more substantial and thicker than cheaper tapes. it isn't the slightest bit shiny. so it disappears on packages. it's easy to tear. the dispenser was sturdy enough that the tape didn't come off the serrated part and stick to itself. and in using the entire two rolls I never had to engage in the frustrating process of trying to find the end and then peel it off of the rest of the roll.  My only beef -- there's not much tape on the rolls.  They're kind of like rolls of wrapping paper. in that it always looks like there's more there than you actually get.It's tape.  It's pretty good tape. and a pleasure to use. but it is just tape.  I would definitely buy Scotch gift wrap tape again. though I don't expect it to change my life."
6,"Scotch Giftwrap Tape may not be new. but if you've never tried it. now's the time! It is made with a special satin or semi-gloss finish that makes the tape virtually invisible on most giftwrap paper. Try it on a package and you'll be surprised at how it disappears. Scrapbookers might want to experiment with this tape as well. With all of the holiday gift wrapping near. you really need to get some of this tape - you will be rewarded with praise for your professional looking packages. Very highly recommended!"
6,"While the glossy tape that I use at the office is good for keeping things together. it shows up very easily on gift wrap. being all shiny.  The matte or satin finsh on this is perfect for gifts..  doesnt attract or reflect light. so that you see the wrapping paper and not the tape. Very simple and it works.Con:  this type of tape is really for gift wrapping and isnt as attractive for normal everyday use. but it can be used as such.  Get both scotch gift tape and scotch regualr tape and you will have the right tape for the right occasion."
6,"Ever since I was a little kid I have loved this Scotch glossy tape.  It's the only brand and variety of tape that I will buy.  It's a little unfortunate that they market this as 'gift wrap tape' because while it is ideal for gift wrap (it literally disappears). it's also perfect for any other task requiring tape. On some surfaces the glossy-ness of the tape will stick out. I still prefer that glossy-ness to the dull-ness that you get by using regular tape.  I also find this stuff to be stickier and easier to work with (long pieces) than the regular Scotch 'matte' tape. Note that Amazon probably isn't your best bet for buying the stuff. as I often see it cheaper at local stores."
6,"We've only ever use Scotch tape at my house. it's the tape that holds up better in not ripping or tearing when you don't want it to. It's always been stronger in keeping this together than the cheaper brands. The Gift Wrap tape is excellent for wrapping any gifts as it boasts a certain amount invisibility. It doesn't completely disappear. of course. but it's less noticeable than other kinds of tape. The price for three roles is pretty cheap as well. I would definitely recommend this Scotch Gift Wrap for any holiday or birthday wrapping you need."
6,"I have routinely spent a lot of money on nice. colorful gift wrap and then. when I get the gift wrapped all that seems to stand out is the tape that is used to seal the package.  This gift wrap tape actually becomes invisable on the package and lets your gift wrap show through.  It doesn't cost much more to make your gift wrapping look really professional.  I used this tape on both a solid blue colored wrap and a mulit-colored paper and it worked great on both.  It was also invisable where I used the tape to attach the little envelope with the gift tag and note.  I recommend this tape and will probably end up using it for more than just gift wrapping.. it's a very nice tape for everyday use as well."
6,"I guess you might say tape is tape is tape but there are varying qualities from the cheap generic to the more expensive name brands like Scotch.  Right here around the Holiday Season gift wrapping is certainly something we're doing a lot of so a set of three rolls of tape comes in very handy.  This particular tape sticks on flat and clear so as not to obscure your wrapping paper.  A definitive advantage over the cheaper tape is that the adhesive is very strong - this tape is not going to pop off the paper as you work on a complex wrap job.  Once it is in place it stays.  I like that.  It pulls from the roll and tears off well on the cutting teeth.  Overall it is good quality tape."
6,"I'm not real sure what I'm supposed to say about this stuff in a review. I mean. is there anybody in the United States who isn't familiar with Scotch tape? It's the grand daddy of all cellophane tapes. and this gift wrap tape just adds a couple features that make Scotch tape better and better. First. it's a handy three pack. just in time for Christmas and assuring even the biggest of gift givers enough tape to wrap everything. Then. there's the satin finish. which becomes darn near invisible on patterned paper. and pretty close to that on everything else. Finally. it sticks. This is a great product. and I don't see how I couldn't give it five stars."
6,"Sure. regular clear tape works fine for gift-wrapping. but if you want your gifts to look like they're professionally wrapped with a tape that blends into the wrapping paper so well you almost don't know it's there. this is the tape for you. The best thing about this tape is that you virtually don't see it on most gift wrapping paper. The satin finish isn't too shiny or mattte. It holds very well and the three pack is a convenient size. Now that I've used this tape. I just can't go back to the old tape I used to use.A quick tip: If you press down and smooth the tape with your fingers after it's on the gift. the tape blends in with the wrapping paper even more and looks like it almost disappears.Great product!"
6,"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape. 3/4 inch. 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish. the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper. I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However. my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser. which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape. even if it means paying more. so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll. and there would be far less waste. Altogether. the tape is nice and the price seems fair."
6,"We've long been fans of Scotch brand products - always finding them dependable.  The same is true of this Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.  It's that time of year again and we've made good use of this already.  It holds wrapping securely yet is transparent enough not to spoil the colorful paper.We also  use it to cover addresses on parcels to be  mailed. knowing it will protect the ink even if the packages are caught in a wet blizzard.The holidays aren't the only  times this tape  comes in handy as we've used it to repair torn pages in a notebook. by doubling it we've used it to attach To-From cards and. believe it or  not. in a real hurry it held the torn hem of a skirt.You  never know what it might be used  for  next - only that you'd better have some on hand."
6,"The tape - at first I wondered: 'How can this be different?'. The answer is rather subtle ... the tape has a strong backing with a semi-gloss (satin if you will) finish. For a 'tape collector' I guess it is slightly between 'magic' and clear tape.* Not a big deal to me and most people. but hey different strokes for different folks.Also it is considered 'photo safe' I guess that means it won't yellow over time like tape from the 70s does/has."
6,"I hate wrapping gifts. so I really liked how easy the tape made it.  You couldn't see the fingerprints. it has a nice finish to it. and the pieces are precut to a nice short length.  I found this all very helpful.  I read on one of the reviews that there was a complaint about the amount of tape that was on these rolls. and I have to agree that there wasn't as much. but for me that was a minor negative.  I think this tape is pretty great and sure is convenient."
6,"Scotch Gift tape is a great product for its intended purpose - wrapping gifts.  The tape is much less noticeable on typical gift wrap than either Scotch Magic Tape (which is a bit too matte for this purpose) or shiny generic tapes.But I have to mark down this particular product down because the amount of product given is so stingy.  Each roll only has 300 inches of tape - compare this to a a Scotch Magic Tape refill that I had sitting in my cabinet that was 1296 inches long.  And I dislike the fact that the product description on Amazon says nothing about how much tape is included. so you won't realize the issue until you get your order."
6,"You buy a nice gift and you want to wrap it for that special person to whom you are going to give it.  You found the perfect gift wrap paper. cut the paper perfectly and fold every crease to perfection.  Now use the best tape there is to seal the deal!Scotch Giftwrap Tape has a unique satin finish that helps the tape disappear on the wrapping paper.  It seals tightly and it is easy to dispense and cut.  It doesn't yellow or show air bubbles and provides the finishing touch on the package.  Tape that doesn't show up so much that it steals the beauty of your wrapping job.Don't forget the ribbon!"
6,"I recently testedScotch Magic(TM) Tape 3105. 3/4-inch x 300 Inches. 3-Packagainst Scotch's(R) Satin Finish Gift-wrap tape.  Both were both 3/4 inches wide.You can't go wrong with either of these products!  They both came in the very familiar and proven dispensers - nothing fancy. and they just work well.I was surprised to see that the Matte Finish product was actually more invisible than the Satin Finish Gift-wrap product - but unless you saw them side by side. you'd never know.The Satin Finish Gift Wrap Tape did allow me to easily remove or reposition the tape.  Either way. find the best price. keep it simple. and use either of these tape products - you will not be disappointed!"
6,"If you are the person that wraps gifts with the comics section of the paper or buys 99 cent rolls of paper then this would be a bit of overkill for you. if you care about your package and you purchase high quality paper then you need this tape. it looks great! The satin finish can't be beat. For about 4 bucks you get about 27 yards of tape. I think that is quite acceptable. If you buy those 50 cent rolls from Big Lots or Walmart you will only get about 6 yards of tape per roll and its crappy tape.The one thing that annoys me to no end with this is the serrated cutting bar. If if were just a smidge wider than the tape it would work way better. Many times it has not cut the tape correctly unless it's just right-so annoying!I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? no"
6,"I've been using Scotch Gift Wrap Tape for years and there is nothing better. Cheaper tape can be fine for general purpose taping (although I still prefer 3M products). but for gift-wrapping. quality is a must. This tape dispenses evenly and easily. cuts cleanly. applies easily. and is truly nearly invisible once applied. The tape holds well as long as stress is lateral to the tape. When the stress is perpendicular to the tape. it sometimes lifts. This is rarely the case when gift-wrapping. I think it is slightly less tacky than general-purpose tape. Sometimes you can lift it off if you make a mistake. but gift-wrap paper tends to be unforgiving. Because it is nearly invisible when applied. it is often best to cut the seam and leave the tape on the paper if you make a mistake. It is not noticeable. There is not must else to say about tape."
6,"This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores. It adheres well. is less likely than many to tangle. and has a nice finish that disappears on the paper once it's been applied. I've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays. and it is just not worth it. The difficulties using those flimsy tape dispensers and lousy cutters. not to mention the tendency to curl up and tangle. make wrapping a chore. Well. this tape doesn't make wrapping a pleasure. but it does make it easy and quick. with a lovely professional appearance."
6,"I know. it's tape.  Scotch tape to be precise.  But that is what sets this tape apart from the competition.  Over the years. I've had consistently better results with all forms of Scotch adhesive products.  The difference is so noticeable that I buy Scotch tape products exclusively. regardless of price.  And speaking of price. this is a very good price for a three pack of Scotch tape!Scotch tape:* sticks better* cuts better* tends to bend more naturally* doesn't seem to yellow/discolor as muchThis 'gift tape' has a matte finish that hides finger prints and largely disappears on your gifts.  If you're looking for a matte-finish tape. I'd definitely start here."
6,"Like Kleenex. Zippers and Google. this is a product that's so good at what it does we pretty much refer to ALL similar items by its name: Scotch tape.Unlike other brands. however. this is a strong tape with a nice. satin finish that disappears against matte wrapping papers.  You don't even have to rub it like crazy with the back of your fingernail to make it invisible. like some inferior brands. If you're using a shiny foil paper you'll want to stick with a tape that has a similar. shiny finish. (Pardon the pun.)"
6,"I used this tape. which has more of a sheen than regular 'invisible' tape. on several different kinds of gift wrap. It definitely blends better with papers with a slight gloss to them since it has a similar texture. On matte-surfaced papers like tissue wrap. craft paper. and 'natural' papers. the slight sheen of the tape makes it show up more. For those who like their wrappings to be really fancy. this tape is a nice addition to wrapping supplies. It would also work well on any project with paper that has a slight gloss to it."
6,"I have always liked Scotch brand products and this one is no different. I like that you get three rolls of this tape because if you are like me one is never enough when wrapping gifts. I love that the dispenser is easy to use. The tape comes off the roll very easily which is a huge plus in my opinion. I also love that the gift wrap tape is clear when you place in onto the wrapping paper. It makes the gifts a lot more appealing considering that you don't have to look at tape 'lines'. In my opinion the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is the best tape for wrapping gifts this holiday season.If you want a tape that is easy to use and looks great on your gifts look no further than Scotch Gift Wrap Tape. I do not think that you will be disappointed."
6,"I always buy Scotch brand tape for use in my home (no idea what stuff they buy at the office - ugh). and this Gift Wrap tape is what I purchase by by the box load for all use year!The satin finish melts into giftwrap. and gives an especially nice finish to my packages. 3/4' is a good width for sealing giftwrap edges.  The finish looks good on matte or shiny paper. and holds well.  I usually take the roll out and put it in a weighted tape dispenser. so I can't comment on the roll dispenser it comes with.Scotch is my go-to brand for household and packaging tapes. and this is one of the styles I buy plenty of in the fall for all year use - Christmas. then birthdays. Mother and Father's Days. etc.  Another winner from the folks who do 'sticky' right."
6,"Love the gift wrap tape!  One of my favorite activities in the world is wrapping gifts.  I don't know why.  I just love matching bows and ribbons with the paper!  The great part about special gift wrap tape is that it is designed specifically to be invisible against wrapping paper--not only is it transparent. but the ends blend into the paper.  To this end. the Scotch Gift Wrap tape almost always succeeds.  The only time it doesn't. however. is when you have shiny or textured wrapping paper--which I occasionally use.  But you can't win them all.  Oh. and as far as using cheapie off-brands...Well. there's always some items when you should always buy name brand:  aluminum foil. saran wrap. toilet paper. AND duct or adhesive tape.  That's just my honest opinion."
6,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping. and was very pleased with how it performed.First. it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second. it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap. you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite 'step up' from my old stand-by. Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
6,"Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is pretty much everything you want from a gift wrapping tape.  It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled. even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure. which I find to be a good thing.  Half the presents that most people wrap are going to kids anyhow. the easy break tape allows them to get into the present without much struggle.  But of course it is still strong enough to go through your general present jossling."
6,"I hope you're not looking for a multi-thousand-word review on this one.  :-)  It's tape. after all.  But this brand has worked well on everything I've thrown at it.  It sticks wrapping paper well. essentially disappearing into the paper once stuck.  But it also sticks stuff to walls well. and in my experience doesn't bring up the paint or leave behind a stick residue when you pull it off.  Good produce that does EXACTLY what it's meant to do!"
6,"For comparison purposes. I posted a photograph comparing Scotch Gift Wrap Tape. their cellophane tape (shiny) and their Magic Tape.  The photo contains a sample of the three styles of tape applied to three different styles of gift wrap -- red foil. brown packing paper (for those wrapping with a less processed product.) and a patterned (non-foil) gift wrap.Perhaps not surprising. the shiny Scotch tape looks best on the foil but the Gift Wrap tape is a better choice for both the brown packing paper and patterned non-foil gift wrap. The Magic Tape had the most unattractive appearance on all three products.The Gift Wrap tape is very sturdy. so sturdy that sometimes it is reluctant to tear across the serrated edge of the plastic dispenser. Rolls inserted into a weighted dispenser would resolve that issue. That issue aside. I will definitely be buying more of this tape and using it for wrapping on all but foil paper. where I will continue to use the shiny tape."
6,"This is easily the best gift wrapping tape I have ever used. It is transparent. of course. but not shiny. like some competing brands I have used. UnlikeScotch Magic(TM) Tape 810-3PK. 3/4-inch x 1296 Inches. 3-Pack(which is also fantastic). this tape doesn't look cloudy on top of wrapping paper; it really is just hard to see. The adhesive is strong enough to hold gift wrap together. but is also forgiving enough to allow you to peel it off and readjust if need to. All in all. this is a great product."
6,"I have always HATED 'invisible' tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you're trying to get it off the roll.  But transparent tape doesn't always look good on wrapping paper...This is the first time that I've tried 'gift wrap tape.' and I LOVE it!  Looks great. but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape.  It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer!The only thing I'd change is...put more on each roll!  :-)"
6,"The first time I purchased Scotch Gift Wrap Tape was three years ago at Christmastime.  I saw it in the drugstore. thought it looked interesting. and decided to treat myself to something new/different.  I immediately became a big fan of it: it blended perfectly with my wrapping paper. virtually disappearing.  I was impressed with how nice it looked.  And. like regular Scotch tape. it was very strong and very easy to work with.Nowadays. this is the only Scotch tape I buy.  It's perfect for everything: home. office. crafts. and of course gift wrapping.  The price is the same as the other types of Scotch type.  It works just as well. if not better.  And it's made in the U.S.A.  What more could you ask for?This is one of those simple. elegant. no-frills products that gets the job done. and done right. every time.  Give it a try. you'll love it."
6,"First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear. this is the right product for you.  On that. 5 stars.  On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star.  It's a better deal and more than the standard 'green' Scotch tape 3 pack. and the price is lower. but still. you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much. this is a decent purchase.  If you don't need tape at multiple locations. I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll. less packaging. etc."
6,"I was happy to review  Scotch Gift Wrap Tape considering the time of year.  Yes. I already have Christmas presents that needed wrapping. so I was set to go.  The tape was easily dispensed; I had no trouble getting whatever size I needed. It went on easily and did not leave that 'tape look' on the wrapping paper. It definitely disappeared nicely.  There was not a lot of tape on each roll so you may want to save this tape for special presents. It might not be appreciated used on a child's present since they rarely take the time to notice the beauty of the wrap. However. for a present that you want to wrap special. this is the tape to use. The product did what it said it would. and really that is what is important."
6,"This is a continuous roll of very thin plastic. and one side of it is tacky (sticky).  The roll is housed in a hard plastic container. which has a serrated cutting device at one end.  What you do is pull on the strip of thin plastic. and when a sufficient amount has been exposed. you sever the plastic strip from the rest of the roll by using the aforementioned serrated cutting device.  I know it sounds confusing. but once you do it 3 or 4 times. you'll get the hang of it.  Truly remarkable new invention."
6,"I've tried saving money and buying off-brand or store-brand wrapping tape.  If you've ever been frustrated with tape that doesn't tear properly. or that dispenses erratically. you know what I mean.  The price of this Scotch wrapping tape isn't much more than the bargain brands. so why buy something inferior that will perform poorly and look unprofessional?  This is the tape to buy for the holidays.  Cuts smoothly. nearly invisible. and makes presents look good.  Can't find any reason not to give this product the five stars it deserves."
6,"This tape is somewhat mediocre.Pros:*Good amount of stickiness on regular paper*Photo safe (have not tested that myself. but they claim it is)*Made in the USACons:*Isn't as &#34;invisible&#34; as they claim (not a huge deal for me. but worth mentioning)*Hard to tear. so by the end of a day of wrapping gifts. my thumb has little serrated cuts from the &#34;blade&#34;*Not much tape on each roll. so seems wasteful to have it split on 3... not sure why they don't put it all on 1 roll*Does not stick to shiny or glittery wrapping paper (neither does normal tape. but you would expect gift wrap tape to be a bit more versatile. especially since most gift wrap these days is fancy)*Wish the tape was wider so it would be easier to use along seams when wrapping"
6,"When it comes to tape. there's nothing else like the Scotch-brand. Unlike other less-familiar brands. Scotch is dependable. This 3-pack of GiftWrap tape provides what Scotch-brand users have come to depend upon - a dispenser that dispenses a tape with a satin finish that will virtually disappear when you use it on most gift wrap. It dispenses easily. tears off without a hitch. and sticks securely. no questions asked. You don't have to worry about whether it's going to stick or not. This 3/4 inch 3-roll pack is perfect to have on-hand for Christmas."
6,"Yes. this tape does look great when wrapping presents. Yes. it disappears on gift wrapped surfaces. But that's not all. I use it for my 'everyday' tape as well - great for small repairs when you need the tape to not leave a strange matte spot on the surface like 'regular' tape. Did your kids rip yet ANOTHER page in their storybook? Scotch BiftWrap tape. Did you forget to put something in that pretty mailing envelope? Carefully unseal it. and then...Scotch GiftWrap tape. Crafts. scrapbooking. kids' projects? Scotch GiftWrap tape. I only wish that more tape came on the rolls."
6,"I dislike wrapping Christmas gifts.  I am horrible at it and if the present doesn't come out with a big ball of paper around it. then it is a major triumph of my soul.  This tape is thick enough to help me calm my wrapping paper beast.  And it holds down velvet ribbon when I don't have enough of it to go all the way around the box and have to tape it piecemeal around the bottom.  It's invisible and matte. so it makes my oddball wrapping look put together.  A wonderful thing.  Five stars."
6,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although. rarely a cutting edge innovator.  A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those.  3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on.  This product might be marginally less opaque. but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.  So. while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes. its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation.  One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied.  Alas. no such thing:  The stuff is still plainly right there if not. perhaps. as plain as day.So. while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still. another excellent product from 3M."
6,"I ordered i think 4 70-sheet notebook spirals. and 2 100-sheet sprials from this company that sent me the wrong items from SAM'S club?? But I didnt return the 2 1oo-sheet spirals along with the 4 120-sheet spirls? because 1. I didnt feel like waiting for them any longer when I needed them for school 2. So that i wouldn't spend any more money on more page spirals at walmart or office depot so it's okay that my order got wrong. I had already ordered 70 sheet spirals of Mead from another company just in case it happened... They are nice notebooks though. Paper quality is a bit thicker than your average thin ..smearable paper if you write with pencil alot (which I don't unless its a math or number involved class)I like them."
6,"My daughter goes through about 15-20 of these notebooks a year in High School. The last time we went to a B&M store to purchase them they were out of the College Ruled ones and only had Wide Ruled. which isn't accepted in her school. I was very happy and surprised to see that Amazon had them for less than $1. so I picked up the limit of three. They are now on the list of items I will order regularly. easy enough to add to any order I'm placing to avoid shipping them on their own and causing more wasted packaging."
6,"For me. I prefer the college ruled notebooks and paper because it just plain holds more info and the notebook last longer. This Mead is top notch quality that I use in different colors and write with different pens and pencils. The paper is of excellent quality so that whatever pen or pencil I choose. the page is highly readable with no smears.This notebook is suitable for any age from young students to senior adults. And I have found these notebooks I keep records in and love to use them next to my computer when I take notes from my computer research.This is a must have spiral notebook as in my opinion. Mead is the BEST ONE!"
6,"This Matte Finish 'Magic' Tape is so much better than the generic types for most uses. It goes on totally clear on most paper. it is very strong. and the matte finish doesn't easily reflect light so it doesn't draw attention to itself.The brand name 'Scotch' has become a 'proprietary eponym' for this type of clear tape. along the same lines as Band-Aid. Kleenex. and Saran wrap for their respective products. This generally happens only when a product is the best of its kind and has become the de-facto standard. This is certainly the case for Scotch Tape.It may cost a little more. but it generally worth it. Highly Recommended!"
6,"This has been my favorite tape for years...which is why we probably call &#34;tape&#34;. &#34;scotch tape&#34;!It simply is better then the others in my opinion. It feels better. it doesn't yellow. it is very easy to wrap presents with. it is almost invisible. you can write on it. and probably thousands of other things.Does it cost a few cents more? Maybe. but it is the quality you are paying for. :)Plus. I am use use to saying &#34;can You tell me where the scotch tape is please&#34;?"
6,"I've been using Scotch Magic Tape since I was a kid. I think it came out during the early 1960's. maybe late 1950's. We always had the Scotch Tape in the red package before this one came out and then it's been the green one for me ever since. Gee. I guess I've been using this tape for around 50 years. I guess that makes me 3M brand loyal.I was running low on tape and was so happy to find this tape as an Amazon add on item when a little short of $25 for free shipping. It was nice to have a reminder that Amazon carries these little office products I'm always needing around my home."
6,"This is filler paper that comes pre-punched with three holes to be inserted into a 3-hole binder.The paper is thick enough that you won't see through it and can write on both sides. It won't immediately break from being taken in and out of the binder (after a while you'll probably want to have some reinforcements around).The price point makes it a bit of a lousy investment though. This paper is on the thinner side and there are only 200 sheets in the packet. at the beginning of the school year. you are usually able to buy Staples or Office Depot brand on sale for 99 cents. This paper does not provide anything special for the extra money (it's currently $2.99 per 200 sheets on Amazon)."
6,"This is 200 sheets of wide rules filler paper.  It has three holes punched for your binder.  The lines don't fade or smudge as some lesser filler papers are prone to do.  It is crisp. clean. white. smudgeproof. and looks and performs like the best papers in the world. at a reasonable price.  I like to get 200 sheets in a package as this is a generous size but not so much that I have to store a lot of excess paper on a shelf where it can get dusty.  Mead makes great office supplies from the ones I've been seeing lately."
6,"I needed this for my daughter. for school work. The paper is pretty good &#8211; it&#8217;s not the really thick paper I remember from my own youth. which was so course that I could actually see the pulp fibers in it with the naked eye! Its thinness reminds me more of the paper I used in college (in the Stone Age. before everyone had a computer).I don&#8217;t think that the paper is unusually thin. It seems to me to be good. normal. wide ruled paper. We are already using it for some work and we are happy enough with it.(Review of Mead Filler Paper. Wide Ruled)"
6,"Come on. paper is paper and ruled refills are rule refills.True. but there is a bit more to it.It all depends on how you like to write. I personally like to write with a fountain pen. (I know. anachronistic) thus. I need paper that will not let the fountain pen ink. that is liquid instead of a gel like ball points or gel pens. seep through the paper.I'm glad to say that this is a solid paper. that holds the ink and has proper texture.I recommend it without reservations."
6,"This notebook paper isn't the best that I've used. It's still pretty nice though. It's a little on the thin side but It fits nicely in a binder. The only advantage I can think of for this thin paper is that your notebook won't be so heavy! I also wondered if the thickness of the paper meant that ink would go right though. I checked that with my runniest pen. which is a Pentel gel pen and am glad to say that the ink does not bleed through. The wide ruled paper is perfect for some children that write bigger. Other than that. the paper has no other flaws and works nicely as notebook paper."
6,"This is a basic pack of loose-leaf paper. nothing in it to overly wow or overly disappoint.  Our paper has all the holes. margins. and lines in the appropriate places. and the lines were dark enough to be visible.  (We&#8217;ve purchased cheaper paper where the lines were almost too faint to see.)  However. if you have a younger writer or someone who puts a lot of pressure on their pen/pencil while writing. this paper may be a bit on the thin side."
6,"We buy a lot of paper each year.  Mead provides a good basic (cheap) paper that will no doubt meet the needs of most students. However. I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day. It's OK - nothing great - a good utilitarian option but for wide-ruled paper (for younger students) I think it really shouldn't be quite so thin.Pricing Note (not part of the review):The price as I write this review is $1.33 for 200 sheets of wide-ruled filler paper. That is the delivered price if you are an Amazon Prime member or combine with other products to get Super Saver Shipping. If the price is higher as you read this review you may want to consider coming back at the start of the next school season and stocking when they are on sale."
6,"I think it's a little pricey for 200 sheets. but then again with Prime that includes 'free' shipping.  We use a ton of paper at our tutoring center. and I prefer the wide ruled for my students. especially the ones in elementary school.  The wide ruled lines give the young writers more room to express themselves in words and numbers.  For math activities I'll sometimes turn the paper horizontal with the lines running up and down. This can help students visualize columns and be better able to list numbers one below the other.These sheets of paper have red margins on both sides for convenience of application. For those who look for it. the Mead filler paper has the  certified sourcing imprimatur."
6,"I've been using Mead notebook paper since I was a kid in school. It's a really good standby.Nowadays I really like to use it as stationery. I cut off the red lines. and then cut down by about five lines from the top to get a good-sized lined piece of paper that can be jazzed up with rubber stamps. Additionally. I also use it a backing paper with nice stationery. so that I don't use more than one sheet of nice stationery for a letter--I use the nice piece as the first page. and these cut to size for other sheets. Either way. it helps save money while creating lined stationery. (Yes. I'm someone who still writes letters!)Whichever use you're getting it for--stationery or school--this basic pack is a generous size with 200 sheets."
6,"This is traditional wide-ruled. three-hole paper. Exactly the quality you expect from Mead--decent thickness with clear. crisp lines and edges--and ideal for grade-school to middle-school writers. If wide-ruled notebook paper is what you. or your child. needs. this is as good as. or better than. any other option. With one caveat ... It's the kind of thing best bought on sale. because off-season or single pack purchase can be absurdly pricey: 4 to 5 times the price of the same goods at better times (like back to school events)."
6,"I'm not sure if the quality varies from package to package but I've noticed that the reviews are all over the place with this product.  My package seemed to be just fine.  I wouldn't say it's high quality but I certainly wouldn't say it's bad either.It may be slightly thinner but when I write on the paper it's not any more visible from the reverse side than any other paper that I've compared it to.The lines are printed on my paper just as they should be.  They're not real dark but they're not too light either.The hole punches are complete and just fine on my package.I would have no problem sending this package in with my elementary aged children.  I think it gets the job done just fine."
6,"I feel this is below average notebook paper here.  The holes were well punched in the paper I received and the lines were correctly printed on the pages with no missing lines. but the lines are light and the paper is thin.  It will work. but you could do better on price and quality at Wal-Mart.  If you can't make it so a store. this isn't a bad option. albeit not excellent.As a side note. I don't think it's too uncommon to buy notebook paper with lines missing on a few pages in a pack.  I've had this happen to me in the past."
6,"This is a pack of standard. wide ruled writing paper that is 3 hole punched.  There are 200 pages per package.  We've had no problems writing on this paper and putting it into a 3 ring binder.The pages themselves are well made. but might be a bit thinner than other standard papers.  We have not experienced any problems with the paper yet. and we are a family of 2 adults. a 4 year old learning to draw and write basic letters. and a 7 year old doing basic sentences."
6,"Those of us who've used a i950 don't need to be told that they drink ink like... I don't know... like how a thirsty something drinks water. In my case. this has been a good incentive to think twice before I go to print anything. Now. this set is a true price break from what I was used to. I don't really need an 8-pack but I did get one once. by mistake and I had no problem with the i950. I just ended up with 2 extra cartridges.It's low price. free shipping... if this was a grocery item. I'd probably set it up as an Amazon subscription. If anyone is aware of a better deal anywhere - it's got to be genuine Canon ink - please leave a comment to this review and I will be more than grateful."
6,"I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. On Amazon. even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only. it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them. that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online. (Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy.)So my review for this product? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was. Good place to buy from."
6,"Having genuine Canon ink has always produced the most predictable results.  I have a profiled monitor for my color work flow.  Output on Kodak Professional Photo paper using ICM profiles (provided by Kodak on their website) along with genuine Canon inks gives me excellent prints on my Canon i950 (yes. it is getting up there in age. but still prints gorgeous prints).And for several years now. I find that Amazon usually has best prices online (unless their competitor has a sale).  B&H; is brick-n-motor I use when I need a pack of ink at the last minute (not Staples or OfficeMax. who charges way too much)."
6,"Excellent price for genuine Canon ink... use this with Canon paper for visually stunning results that last.  In my experience. it is smart to purchase extra Photo Magenta and Photo Cyan cartridges as they tend to run out first.  It is wonderful to have the option of purchasing individual genuine Canon cartridges at such a reasonable price and have them delivered the next day or the day after via Amazon.If you are searching for the highest quality ink that delivers exquisite. professional results. look no further.Thanks. Amazon. for making my life easier and offering this excellent 5-Star ink at such a reasonable price."
6,"I have a love/hate relationship with my Canon i9900. also know as the incredible ink sucking machine.  Photo quality is amazing. how quickly it eats through ink cartridges if frightening.That said. there is simply no substitute for the Canon inks.  The aftermarket stuff will look awful at best. will clog up your machine at worst.Like all ink. this stuff is obscenly over-priced.  Still. the Amazon 8-pack set will save you a small fortune versus buying them seperate.  Recenly I needed a single color and ran off to a big box store.  The single cartridge was about $15.So. use only genuine Canon ink and buy it only from Amazon.  Nuff said."
6,"I've had this printer for about four months now and it works great.  I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily.  Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast.  I bought a generic memory card for $8.  The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds.  Toner prices. even when you eventually need to replace the drum. are still about the cheapest of any laser."
6,"I rcvd my black trim line phone today. Out of the 352 reviews I only read the #1 rated ones. to see what was said. Several people said people on the other end cannot hear well. I immediately tested mine. and called 2 friends. who both said they could hear me quite clearly. It is funny how there are always people who harshly criticize products in these reviews. yet so many other people do not find anything wrong. I wonder how that can be. can there really be such a big difference between one unit and another. I thought I would like the Black color best. and it cost less than the White. but I see now that the Black shows finger print smudges very easily. I will be keeping it on my bookshelf for use during power outage."
6,"The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house. shop. and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (Belkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which. although limited. does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is 'backlit' and draws power directly from the phone line. allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial. we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
6,"I like this phone so much that I bought a second one in white. It works well. does not require power to operate. and still has a few options of more expensive phones. By using a key combination. you can participate in 3-way calling. It has a mute button. volume control. Flash. auto redial. and can store up to 12 numbers in memory. It has an illuminated keypad and a 3-level ringer adjustment button. It is lighter than Trimline phones from the '80s. but it doesn't feel cheap. It's just that all of the analog parts inside from that decade have been replaced by digital ones. Even if this phone craps out after a year. it is so affordable that I consider it a &#34;disposable&#34; item. I recommend buying this item."
6,"When you need a phone during an emergency or power outage. when you want a phone that is reliably located on the 'base' where someone hasn't walked away with the handset. this is the IDEAL phone! The phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack.  If you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord.  I like this! It's nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind! The phone comes with pulse and tone dialing (needed to use computerized dialing.)"
6,"There is no doubt that more people are choosing to get mobile phones for whenever they need to call up. as well as cordless phones for mobile use at home. But there are still those of us whom would just rather prefer the need of just having a simple phone for one place in the house to call. That is the case with AT&T;'s 210 Corded Phone. This is a very simple and easy to use phone that works for just about anyplace in the house. where you want to keep your calls stationery. I also found it to be very easy to read and understand. and rings louder than my cordless handsets in need of a call to home. If you really are looking for a extra phone for the home or the office. than I definitely recommend this classic phone from AT&T.;Price: B+Convience: BOverall: B 1/2+"
6,"My portable phone finally went haywire so I decided to buy this corded phone since I don't really need a portable and all the static that comes with it. This AT&T phone is a basic design. feels sturdy and works very well with clear sound.  No static. no distortion. no sounding like people are in the distance or speaking from a straw or whatever. it sounds just like the good old solid phones we used to have before all the portable junk started spreading all over the place.  I accidentally dropped it when answering a call and it came out unscathed. If you want a solid. basic phone without bells and whistles. buy this one.  Actually. it does have the ability to program thirteen numbers (a feature I used successfully) so it does have some bells and whistles."
6,"I have my electrical phones and cellular in the house.  However. here in Miami we do get serious storms and hurricanes during which time. electrical phones do not function.  Therefore. I have now this extra unit connected to my printer/scanner which I use while sitting at my PC and should we have a hurricane. can transfer to my bedroom for regular communications.  You will be surprised how many time the phone lines do not go down but you cannot use the other phones because there is no electricity!  Great deal.  Only wish it had lights on the buttons. which I believe is supposed to have but I don't see them at least on mine."
6,"I bought this paper after purchasing an Epson Aritsan 730 printer. only to see it not show very good print quality on generic printer paper.  I had tested the Epson Photo paper. and found it to be superior in quality to the HP premium paper that I had used for Photos. so I figured perhaps I needed to go with better paper for my basic printing as well.  Made a huge difference.  Text looks wonderful on it.  Paper is a nice thickness and doesn't feel as flimsy as most generic papers.  It should...afterall. it's roughly double the price of bargain paper.  But when you're looking to print something and have it look nice. better to go with good quality paper"
6,"I typically use Boise X9 Bright 20lb paper in both my laser and inkjet printers. This Epson product is ever so slightly heavier. I barely notice it. but for two sided printing. the 24lb paper is an improvement as you don't see the print as easily on the other side of the page. I also notice that it is somewhat brighter in shade and smoother. allowing for the inkjet to do a better job with fine print. For regular black type. the laser still outperforms the appearance of even the best inkjets. but since so much of our work has color these days. it's nice to find an inexpensive solution for at least the paper side of the equation. This is a step up from basic copy paper. but it's not such a step up that anyone will say. &#34;Oooo...nice paper.&#34;Watch for a good price. as the price varies from $5 to $10 for 500 sheets."
6,"It has an eye-angled. upright display. and is perfect to work on a desk. The keypad is not as soft as other calculators on the market. giving you a retro and reliable feel (if you have ever used those full size desktop calculators popular a decade ago. you know what I am talking about.)I find other calculators (e.g.. Sharp EL-377T) awkward to use on a desk. They are perfect for handheld. If you want to have a calculator on your desk and operate with one hand and without leaning forward to check the LCD screen. this Canon LS-82Z is perfect for you."
6,"This simple calculator seems to work fine. as advertized.  I docked it a star because I wasn't able to find a function for integrations or higher order functional analysis. but I suppose you can't have everything in a five dollar calculator.It also lacks voice control. has little or no artificial intelligence. and in general makes a very poor companion if you're stuck alone with it on a desert island.  It does break the ice at parties with the classic 58008 joke. but only the most sophisticated of users are able to appreciate the humor."
6,"My 4th grader was told that they could use calculators in class. She didn't like the ones provided by the school but I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that could easily get lost or broken. She wanted a fancy. fun calculator but none of them had good reviews and she really didn't need a toy on her desk.So I picked this up for her for three reasons:1. It has a built in cover. perfect for keeping it safe in a backpack2. It is solar and battery powered - double the options3. It was the perfect price at less than $3!It works well. is small enough for a desk and easy enough to read."
6,"Nice useful calculator. Not as nice as the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator. which I really like. it is great just the same. It has a hard case that protects the calculator from regular use or putting in one's pocket or briefcase. It goes off when you close the case. It is a good size to use on the go or on your desk. Looking for a handy durable calculator. I think this will fit the tbill. More so. the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator will be even better. See my other review."
6,"This HP Multipurpose Copy/Laser/Inkjet with 96 Brightness. I was so glad to find in a local store last week. So I have been printing letters. forms. misc type of documents on it and am amazed the brightness of the paper for such a reasonable price! And since I have an HP Printer. I am glad to have paper with HP's endorsement (on the back of the wrapping for this paper. it states that it was actually made by International Paper Company under license of HP). So this paper is made for HP and other quality types of printers. whether HP or another brand.So glad I am using this paper now as in the past. I paid for the generic and cheap types of paper that a brightness of about 88. which is not that good when it is compared to 96 brightness. And the old generic paper cost the same price as this high quality paper.For the cost of this product and the quality. this is in my opinion a BEST BUY!"
6,"I have ordered this pack for the first time. and as usual. HP has come through once again. The price is one of the best as I've compared to purchasing in different office supply stores. The quality is top notch. I have no complaints. Thus far. I've already used about 50 pages & it was recently delivered. The colors are bright & no paper jams noted on my 2 printers. When I find a product this good. I will order again-and-again. Totally satisfied. Highly recommended!"
6,"hello.out of paper and need some the next day?  you could go to one of the big chain stores or just use the amazon services.  the cost is much better here and the delivery was so fast. that we were surprised to see the package on our porch.  the product is the standard hp paper. but the b/w printing from our epson artisan printer stands out when finished.  96 is perfect for everyday printing. for printing special notices and in times of actual letter writing on the computer... colors stand out and the b/w printing is high quality.  this is a great product."
6,"That makes this my first Costco purchase.  I have a one person household so a mountain of toilet paper isn't that attractive.  I'll say though. it was a bit of a shock to see Costco using Amazon.  They seem to have an active site of their own.As to the paper. it is a nice bright white that I don't have to be embarrassed using.  It is the right weight to go through my laser.  So. 3 to 5 stars are certainly in order.  I went with the middle but could have gone higher. if &#34;Loving&#34; paper had a bit better connotation."
6,"I have used it in my HP1022 laser printer and my wife uses it in her Brother laser printer and it always delivers clean. clear printouts. even on side 2.Update 7/7/2014:After using this paper in my HP Laserjet 1022 printer to print documents on 2 sides of the paper. discovered that the heat produced a VERY strong curl on the ends of the paper on the first side printed and it made it extremely difficult to feed the paper back into the printer and get reliable feeding for side 2. Absolutely ruined a 2nd side printing of a 100 page document. Took 2 stars off of the original rating for this problem and don't think that I'll purchase this paper again."
6,"Not a cinch to put together - just so you know &#34;part F&#34; is IN the long tube - don't look for it!  Just start by screwing the long tubes together - this IS step one.  The rest is figure it out as you go - the instructions aren't great - but it winds up being a decent cart.Not meant to lean on. feel a LITTLE tippy - but nothing that interfere with normal functioning.  There are two locking breaks on two of the wheels so you might want to note that before deciding which wheels go where."
6,"The cart is well made. craftsmanship. assembly. etc. no complaints.My only gripe is that the shelves are (to me) up-side-down.  I dont want the 'lip' on the shelf pointing upwards.  Most of my wire shelves have the lip pointing down at the front tip of the shelf.  This makes it more convenient to pull out larger jugs off the shelf.  I suppose some can argue that the jugs could slip off while one moves the cart. so it is better to have the lip pointing up.99% of the time the cart is stationary for me.  only a few times a year I would move it out of the utility room to make more room for carrying bulky things through the utility room.  That said. I would rather have at least the top and center shelves to have the lip pointing down."
6,"Standard modular metal shelving construction. other than the lip on the shelves are inverted from their usual orientation.No idea why people are having problems assembling it. it took about 7 minutes to put together. Tips:1. Disobey the instructions and put the wheels on first.2. Only clip the plastic supports for one shelf at once. starting at the bottom. Add that shelf. Repeat.3. If lifting it. don't try to pick it up from the shelves. pick it up from the uprights. The connectors only work in compression. not in tension.The clips never look that strong. but they work very well in practice. and the same construction holds up for much larger and heavier units than this."
6,"This was purchased to be used as a microwave cart. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and it was reasonably priced. which made me a little hesitant because I thought it might be flimsy.It isn't flimsy. It goes together quickly and easily and I am impressed with how sturdy it is. My microwave is 19.5' W x 10.5' H x 14' deep and fits perfectly on top.There is a little 1' rim on each shelf and the shelves can be placed with the rim up or down.I am very satisfied with this little cart - it helped me free up quite a bit of cupboard space in my tiny kitchen."
6,"Before the age of checkbook register smartphone apps. I dutifully turned to this calculator to balance my checkbook. I'd tried other calculators. but they were either too small. the keys were too close together. the display too small. or something else made them less than ideal. With this one. it stays in place on my desk. it has a large display. the buttons are laid out intuitively. it goes well with my modern decor. and it has both battery and solar power. This calculator would be good for home of business use. but would not be suitable for a student since it does not come with a case and probably would not stand up to being thrown around in a backpack. locker. or desk."
6,"1.  For baseline. I have used an Epson 1280 for the past two years.2.  The only reason to get this printer is if one wants longer life prints.  The print quality / image is MORE difficult to achieve with this printer--not impossible. but more difficult.  Overall. the paper profiles are fairly good (epson papers)--the colors are fairly accurate.  However. the prints are definitely &quot;flatter&quot; (ie less contrast. less saturation) compared to the 1280--this can be worked around to a large extent by simply increasing contrast (esp the black point) and saturation...around by 10 points.3.  Overall. I like the 1280 prints better to a slight degree. but if viewed by itself without a comparison print. the prints from the 2200 are good.  Furthermore. with the increase in print life. overall it's a decent compromise for me.  One has to evaluate their own priorities to see if it would be worth it for them."
6,"This printer is the biggest ink hog I have ever seen. If you download the optional ink reserve software you can actually see your expensive inks disappear. Granted. when the printer is working properly you can get wonderful images. If you are not constantly printing. the nozzles will clog. It is almost impossible to find anyone to work on these printers because the nozzles are built into the printer. After throwing a couple hundred down the drain on this printer. I smartened up and bought a Canon Pro9000. My new Canon is a wonderful wide format printer with easy installation and the nozzle cartridge is removable!"
6,"I have had my epson 2200 for ten years now. and it is still going strong. Yes. it uses a lot of ink. and yes. the ink is expensive. but the results are well worth it. I find it works better if it is used often.This is not a printer for the timid. However. if you are willing to spend the time learning about the color management. and calibrations. the unit delivers spectacular prints.I am particularly impressed with the print quality from this machine. I use the velvet fine art paper. and find the prints are extremely stable. and the colors do not fade or shift."
6,"If you're fed up with half-wits pestering you at home in the evening. this device is a godsend. I had been receiving an average of three calls each evening. which I tried to deal with by turning down the answering machine. But I still heard the 'beep' each time a call was received. Worse yet. some of the callers felt the need to leave a message.The TeleZapper cuts off these calls before they even get to your answering machine. or to you. There are competing products that cost less. but this one is the most effective that I've found."
6,"SFI certified sourcing addresses the 90 percent of the world's forests that are not certified. Program participants must show that the raw material in their supply chain comes from legal and responsible. As long as you are going to use paper. you might as well be responsible.I have atrocious handwriting. So atrocious that I have reverted mostly to block printing versus Script. My second problem is keeping an even line on the page. This 'Mead Filler Paper. College Ruled. 200 Sheets (15326)' solves my mind problem. Just a note the ruling is on both sides of the page.I cannot speak to bleed through on calligraphy inks; I use a gel ball pen and there is no bleed through whatsoever.I suggest you buy several of these packs as you will be surprised how quick you go through the pages."
6,"I guess I remember what these packs of paper were like when I was in school (which was some years ago now).  I remember them being thicker than this. but it's not like the product I got was too thin.  I saw another review saying you can't write on both sides of the paper with ink.  I wouldn't go quite that far. but it is a bit &#34;thinnish&#34;.Still. having said that it is what it is.  A pack of paper that you can put in your binder and write stuff on.  It's fine.  Makes great paper airplanes. too.  :)"
6,"Mead provides a good basic (cheap) paper that will no doubt meet the needs of most high school or even college age students.  However. I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day.  It's OK - nothing great - a good utilitarian option.Pricing Note (not part of the review):The price as I write this review is $1.46 for 200 sheets of college-ruled filler paper.  That is the delivered price if you are an Amazon Prime member or combine with other products to get Super Saver Shipping.  Yes. Prime Members can literally buy this and have it delivered anywhere in the US - in 2 days - for $1.46!  If the price is higher as you read this review you may want to consider coming back at the start of the next school season and stocking up."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"This is one of those cases where you get what you pay for. I tried the re-fill route. and was not at all pleased - one cartridge leaked. another worked fine for a short while then started to produce smeary text. Bit the bullet and went back to the real HP 56 cartridge (this is for an HP all-in-one) and have never had a problem since. Cost a bit more. but they work perfectly.Amazon has a great deal if you set it up as a regular order - lower price and free shipping. Also. don't forget you can get $3 at Staples if you turn in your empty cartridges there."
6,"Presently the Amazon price for a new one. especially for customers who have Prime. is unmatched.  You might save a few bucks with refurbs. but I sure haven't had much luck with them.  Should you go with a refurb. be sure that you use your printer on a regular basis.  They dry up faster than new ones. requiring multiple recleanings (and wasting of the 'good' cartridge's ink) and occasionally simply refusing to come back to life. If you do purchase a refurb from an Amazon vendor and are dissatisfied with its performance. don't write reviews panning the cartridge as though it were Amazon's or Hewlitt Packard's fault."
6,"As noted in one of the reviews.  The software is in great. but the fact it is powered by USB is one less chord to worry about.  I recommend it to anyone interested in a cheap portable scanner.  You'll fall in love with it.  Again. don't expect too much and we pleasantly surprised.One thing I love the auto crop feature when I scan a photo it crops it in the final image.  Instead of having a big white area where there was no photograph.  It is cool.Peace out"
6,"I bought this scanner back in 2004.  I do a lot of digital art and at the time I needed a scanner that will scan in very high resolution.  Resolution can get up to 1200 x 2400 dpi.  Usually I only need 600. but it's great having the option.  4 years later I'm still using it. and it still works perfectly.  The only problem is it's slow. and a little loud when it's scanning.  This is worse depending on how high you have the resolution set.  But I wont be replacing it any time soon because for now it completely meets my needs."
6,"This product works exactly as you'd expect it to. it holds your books up with no fuss. The setup was pretty simply despite the truly atrocious instructions (the pictures don't even make any sense) and it seems sturdy enough to last many years.If someone gave me this product for $15. even $20. I would be impressed and recommend it to everyone I know. But the asking price here (the MSRP is over a hundred bucks!!!) is just out of control. It's so ridiculous that I found myself searching for some hidden feature (built-in LED lights. diamond encrusted accessories) that could possibly make it worth that much.Long story short: Great product. but you'd have to be out of your mind to pay this much for plastic."
6,"I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is!  It has a large footprint and it's got a significant weight to it...it really will hold up to 300 sheets!  I do find that for some reason. the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use. so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things (as I mentioned. it's rather large). you run the risk of losing that cord."
6,"I got this product for my wife who was complaining about losing her place in cookbooks while working.  It has worked great!  She is able to put her largest cookbooks. or 3-ring binders. or loose sheets on this holder. and with the elastic strap she never loses her spot.  The holder hasn't tipped over. with heavy books.  Keeping the books upright also makes following the recipes easier.  It does take up some space. but fits above our cabinets. but it could be a concern for some."
6,"For the price I expected better (as did some other reviewers). I shouldn't have spent so much money on this. The quality & design is worth about $25 in my opinion. not what I ended up paying. even on a lightening deal.I'm worried this thing won't last and that it will break at what seems like a weak point where the supports hold the clear plastic piece.So based on the poor value & that it seems it will break at the 'weak point'. I only feel comfortable giving this 2 stars.UPDATE 2013-03-15: My wife has been using this and so far it's been working well. I'm still concerned about it breaking and don't think the design is the best and still don't think it's worth the current price. but it's holding up and I haven't heard any complaints from my wife. Therefore. I'm upping my rating from 2 to 3 stars."
6,"The thing is huge and takes up way too much space on my desk. I don't like the legs at all. they are not sturdy and I feel that they should have been made all one piece (like a frame) and then attach to the plastic holder. You can't pick this up with the legs attached. This is also a little high for my monitor. I have a large monitor but it sits a little low on the desk so I can't tilt this thing very far because it then obstructs the view of my monitor. I don't expect it to last long because of all the plastic pieces and the little lip that the legs attach to are not going to be sturdy either."
6,"Overall. I believe this copy holder to be a good product.Pros*Good looking (although it will most likely be hidden behind copy or a book*Holds books flat (due to elastic band. and bottom lip)*wide enough for to hold two 8 1/2 x 11's*very sturdy (due to the heavy base)Cons*Seems the clear plastic could break (also due to the heavy base)*adjusting the angle is not as easy/accurate as it should beAlso of note: this won't work well as a cookbook holder because there is no splash guard for the books"
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
6,"PROSSturdy and somewhat heavy weight.It's going to hold open most books. Which is what you want.Doesn't cover the bottom of book like some book holders. Only a thing band hides the text.Quality materials.Sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it.CONSIt's definitely big and a bit deep. so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk. It needs to be as wide as most hardcover textbook/cookbooks. Unlike some book holders. there is no book overhang over the edge. due to the design.The bottom hinges are a little weak. Like it can too easily fold in on itself. But it hasn't been a problem and can be fixed each time.I wish it DID fold up easily and was more easily adjustable.I wish it had an extra band in case this one gets broken or lost."
6,"This product weighs a ton. or at least way more than a document holder made for sheets of paper.  Also. unless your monitor is well above the desk. anything you put in this will block the screen. plus you need room front to back room between your keyboard and monitor.  Buy this only if you have the space and need the holder for heavy items.  For papers (e.g.. contracts. homework) use a document holder that is longer top to bottom (or tape the pages one at a time to a top corner of your monitor)."
6,"While not being familiar with the rest of the market. I am impressed by this product.  It is like the metal book holders which I have used before. the ones that keep the pages open.  But it works with documents.  For a researcher. this is a helpful tool in order to type commentary at the computer while retaining the documents vertically.  Set up is simple.  The only problem is that the string keeping the documents in place sometimes is liable to come loose.  Other than that. I really like it."
6,"The 3m Copy Holder is useful in a variety of ways. It's good for the student who needs to type up his or her notes from classes. Or the office worker who needs a place to hold papers. The copy holder is 18' wide and is sturdy enough to hold up to 300 sheets of thick paper. catalogs. books. and more. The copy hold fits perfectly on most desks or tables and is designed to be positioned directly between your computer monitor and keyboard. however it will easily fit anywhere. It also has an elastic cord that stretches across to hold your documents in place.  Overall this a very handy office tool and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs it."
6,"First of all. I LOVE this product. It is well-consructed. It uses quality material. It is a great size for most books. and it just looks beautifully professional on my desk.It tils back easily so you can read at a couple of angles. However. as useful as the ledge on the bottom is for stopping the book from slipping off. it also makes page turning difficult because it cannot be removed nor is it mobile.The base/legs cannot be set in a perfectly straight angle. but that's probably just me being anal."
6,"I do like the fact that this stand has adjustable angles but am taken aback by the price/design ratio.  The way that the legs attach to the sides of the support makes the stand wobbly if you are putting heavy books on it.  The 3M engineers did not do their usual excellent job with design on this product.The elastic band is basically like a rubberband my daughter uses in her hair. with two plastic attachments to it. For this price a few extras should have been included. I had envisioned my kids using it to hold up textbooks when working on homework and this stand simply cannot handle the weight.Overall. it works ok. but for this price it should be much sturdier and be nearly perfect."
6,"This is a very useful product.  It holds items such as books. papers. and it can even be used as an art easel!  The leg arrangement makes it a bit bulky and awkward to move around--but it is also the unique leg arrangement that allows it to be adjusted in so many ways and the weight of the legs is what keeps it sturdy.  I like the clear plastic backing which actually creates a very clean. contemporary. and lightweight appearance.Bottomline:  Great item if you don't need to move it around a lot!"
6,"Easy to assemble!!  Sturdy!!  Works very well.  I thought the clear plastic was a good idea.. With it. you don't really need to remove the item to see your Computer screen.  It seems to be of very good quality.  I didn't give it another star 'cause I wished it would have been a bit easier to remove when needed.  It kind of 'bends in the middle' when moving it.  But. all in all a handy item to have around."
6,"To me. this kit seems like a cheap product. overall.  And an unnecessary one.You get a couple of very small microfiber cloths and a cheap tool made of foam rubber that has a material something like Velcro on one side (that you scrub with) and a U-shaped prong on each end.  Apparently the prongs are for going between the keys on the keyboard.  You also get a small bottle of cleaning fluid.I can't see where anyone really needs any of this.  You're better off using a damp cloth or something else.  3M (if it's the same company) makes some other very good products.  I've used their wet or dry sandpaper over a period of years and it's excellent.  But I wouldn't recommend this particular product at all."
6,"This product is simply amazing and so easy to work. I had neglected my mac keyboard at work for a while and it had accumulated quite a bit of gunk on the keys. It took just about a minute or so of cleaning with this kit. Drop the cleaning solution on to the provided sponge brush. do some circular motions on the keyboard - you'll see it getting cleaned right away. I didn't have to use the 'side' brushes. but can see how useful it would be on a windows keyboard with deeper keys."
6,"This is the one.  This is the first all-in-one keyboard cleaning kit I have ever used that really delivers.  The instructions are clear and the tools are high quality.  After using the cleaner for the first time I was amazed that my keyboard (a Logitech ergonomic) looked and felt brand new after I had used dirty fingers to pound out thousands of pages on it.  Don't even bother with searching for another kit.  There is one thing though.  There should be about twice as much of the cleaning solution provided."
6,"if you look at other reviews. someone once mentioned that you have to let them sit for a while. I let them sit for about six hours before using them otherwise for some reason they don't want to release from the backer. it's strange. but that's what I've found. I just purchased my last batch of these labels. As soon as they run out I will be using a printer that will print directly onto the discs. much simpler and better too. It all depends on how many discs you make."
6,"The key claim of these labels is that when you are ready to 'peel and stick' them after printing. they are easier to peel off of the backing (the slick sheet that they come on) than other brands are. It's true -- they have simply removed a little bit of paper between each column of labels so that you can fold back the backing paper and easily grasp the edge of each label.If you find existing labels easy to peel off. as I do. there's no reason to get these labels. But if you have to handle hundreds or thousands of labels in a row. the little extra convenience may be worth it.I rated them 4 stars rather than 5 stars only because there is nothing amazing about them."
6,"I've used a lot of these labels by different brands.  The generic ones seem to have thinner paper. and lack the nice easy peel edge these have.  Two brand-name labels are my favorite. and these are one of them.  The price either way is the same. and buying in the big box saves money if you use many of these.Like:- Quality paper; adhesive stays to paper. not backing.- Easy peel edge.  Tried some without this feature. and really missed it.  We use these many at a time so any time saver is huge.- Value.  3000 labels makes them near a penny each."
6,"My company uses over 50.000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them.  These stickers are top quality in every respect.  They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems.  The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers.  The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond. but will pull off.  It appears they are designed to do this.  I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.  However. in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us.  You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you."
6,"I love labels. or anything that makes life easier.  I am very organized. both at work and at home.  Labels make things so much more convenient and quicker.I love these labels.  They don't necessarily have to be used with a printer - they can be written on.  And the reason I say this. is because these labels are for Laser Printers. and I have ink jet printers.  Therefore. I can still use these. because I can write on them rather than running them through the printer.There are a variety of uses for labels.  In addition to addresses. files. and other office reasons. they can be used for jars. boxes. etc.Awesome product."
6,"I like Avery poducts.  These are no exception.  High quality and perform as expected.  It should be obvious from the size. but these are not the biggest labels.  If you are going to be printing out a lot of labels in bigger font. like say for wedding invitations. then I would choose a bigger label.  I'm not comfortable with inkjet generated labels since they are susceptible to water dissolving the ink... for important letters. I like to stick with laser printed ones (or use ballpoint pen)."
6,"I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years. I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels. I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two. I have gone back to the Avery labels. They are crisp. pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line. They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate."
6,"I've used Avery Labels for many years for my Christmas cards. They work good on either my inkjet when I want color. or my laser jet. There is a template on Microsoft Word (Avery 5160)that makes creating the labels very easy. The size is just enough for name and address. There is no room to add Clip Art. You would have to use a larger label if you wanted to add let's say a Christmas Tree or a Snowman picture. Now that I have these labels. I add a little sticker next to the name to make it look more festive and it looks like its part of the label so it's fine. Also. there are so many labels (3000) in the box. that I usually give them away because after a few years they lose their sticking ability and become useless. Overall I like the Avery labels and feel confident they're going to stick to the envelope."
6,"Like every Avery paper product I've ever used in the last 25 years (a whole lot). they are superior in terms of fit. function and finish.  The thought of an Avery label jamming up my printer is non-existent.  While it's always possible to get cheaper labels. let's just say you'll get what you pay for with Avery.  Not to mention you can really save a bundle by purchasing them on Amazon. as compared to any in-person stationary type store."
6,"Side-by-side comparison:3M Address Labelsare just as good. Go for the best price.I've used Avery and 3M labels for years.The 3M have the same easy-peel layout with different laughable slogans.The 3M package claims 'Permanent Adhesive' and 'Strong Stick.' The Avery stick just as well. or almost as well.I have not tried the less expensiveMaco Address Labels.I find the 1' x 2-5/8' size is big enough if you use size 9 font (Arial). I get up to 38 characters per line x 5 lines."
6,"These are the standard size/weight address labels. There's really not any way to make these exciting. but then again. do you really want excitement from an address label? These are exactly what you expect. and I have to say I really do prefer the name brand labels to the office store brands. They just seem to feed & stick more reliably.These feed easily in both the drawer and tray of my laser printer. peel cleanly (the non-label backing is already off the waxy paper. so removing them from the backing is super easy.I also really like that the label/template number is printed right on the label so you don't have to hunt down the package to generate the appropriate template. Finally. I like the box. It's sturdy corrugated with a flip-top lid so the lid won't go astray and the labels stay in the box. even if it's sideways on as shelf.Mine came with a sample of note tabs. a nice extra bonus."
6,"Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case. packages or envelopes. These have the added advantage of having what the company calls 'TrueBlock Technology' -- which basically means that they block out the old address. allowing you to reuse the packaging materials. This is a great. eco-friendly solution. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted. part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However. overall it's a fine product."
6,"They don't get jammed in the printer. the labels don't peel off unexpectedly. the sheets do not stick together. so that is all that I ask from labels. One thing that you should consider is the price and how many you'll need.The price for the labels is competitive versus others in the market. While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user. the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings. I am somewhere in between and have found these to be perfectly acceptable."
6,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact. I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
6,"If you have a list of mailings to send and are ready to print address labels you'll want reliable label sheets.  That's what Avery offers with this item.  Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes.  This item contains enough labels to last awhile.  These kinds of labels can be used for a variety of projects. not just for mailing addresses.  Avery is a leader in offering convenient office supplies - this address label package is one of many of their offerings that you'll find useful."
6,"I have two different laser printers. each with a special envelope slot that is meant to feed envelopes so that you can print an address directly on each envelope. There are two problems with both. First. you can feed only one envelope at a time (they won't accomodate a stack of envelopes). Secondly. half of the time the envelope jams and you must pull the printer apart to fix the problem. So. I have given up on running envelopes through my laser printers.The Avery Easy Peal mailing label sheets fit into the standard 8.5' by 11' tray and feed flawlessly through the print track. I can print 300 labels in less than a minute and each label peels off the backing easily and can be stuck to an envelope or package quickly.The drawback is. you must run a sheet of 30 labels through the printer even if you need only one label. But if you have a lot of mailing to do. this generous quantity of labels helps get the job done quickly and inexpensively."
6,"Granted. nobody goes orgasmic over labels. Labels are labels. right?They are until they jam up. or smear when you take them out of your printer. Nothing more aggravating that having labels that accordion up in your printer. and the labels curdle and get stuck in the mechanism.It doesn't happen with Avery labels. They simply work. Print a list. and it's sitting in the printer tray. perfect and ready to use. every time.You might not spend a lot of time. thinking about labels. until you can't get them to print right. If you use Avery. you'll never have to think about labels ever again. cause they just do what they're supposed to do: print perfectly. every time."
6,"For years I used to send away for return labels and then I found out how easy it is to make my own and I'll never send away again.You go to the website listed on the box and get the free templates there and make perfect labels. There are several new designs available for both PC & Mac and they're a breeze to make.There are 3000 labels in the box and the price is incredible.  I'll be set with labels for decades.These new ones now Pop-Up when you bend the sheet making them the easiest to peel off for use.THEY'RE GREAT!"
6,"These Avery labels do exactly what they're supposed to.They feed perfectly. are perfectly spaced on the label sheet. are easy to peel and position.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work:You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Tools; then Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5160Type in what you want on the labeland print.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking labels.  I use them as return address labels. because this size is 'taller' than many and allows an extra line or two on the label.Really!--you won't be diaappointed--these labels live up to the Avery reputation."
6,"This generous box comes with 3000 labels. each sheet containing 30 white labels. My software didn't have the recommended Avery 5160 template when designing my mailing labels. but it was an universal fit and worked with all of the 1' X 2 5/8' templates (I tried and used all 6 of my templates successfully. even if they weren't from the specific avery company. Since I have had problems in the past with a competing company. I was pleased with the fact that these labels were instantly dried and therefore there was no smearing that occured with the drying process. Overall. these are extreamely useful for address labels and come highly recommended."
6,"These Avery labels are excellent quality. I've never had a problem with these ripping. yet I can peel them with ease.  They fit in the paper trays and they are pulled into printers. line up with the software that i've used. printed. and expelled onto the output tray.  I've NEVER had a problem using them.  I also use them for things like labeling wires and pipes in my house.  I've even used a couple of them as Christmas gift labels after I ran out of regular labels.  They are easily stored.  Purchased from Amazon. it arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I give everything that I review a grade. and I believe that this merits a solid 'A'.  I highly recommend it for anyone who uses labels for mass mailings. printed labels on files. etc."
6,"I've used Avery labels since my days as a mail clerk. way back in the Carter administration.  They have always offered a top-quality product. and the Easy Peel line for laser printers are no exception.These labels are just so wonderful; by using word processing software such as Microsoft Word. one can easily select the 'labels and envelops' option under 'Tools' and up pops the correct format for the labels.  Just start typing or import addresses and you are ready to go.  I'll admit that the most use I've had on these labels are for Christmas cards and hand writing labels. but these would be great for a small business.Recommended product; another winner from Avery.  They work well. perform well. and don't screw up the laser printer.  As good as it gets."
6,"I compared these Avery 5160 white labels with some off-brand labels I've used in the past.  They are very similar in print quality and ease of use.  The Avery labels use their 5160 template. which is available in Microsoft Word or from the free software available for download from [...].  Either way. the labels are easy to format and print.  The easy peel feature makes it easier to remove the labels compared with my off-brand labels.I also compared these with Avery's 5260 labels. which are almost identical in size. use the same 5160 template. and have the same easy peel feature but cost quite a bit more.  If you do a lot of label printing the 5160 package with 3000 labels is a much better value for the money spent.  Keep in mind these labels are only for use with a laser printer."
6,"I have a set of the same size 1 x 2.62 inch Avery labels for addresses for my Ink Jet printer which always have worked very well but I was happy to get labels to use with my laser printer since the printing doesn't run if subjected to moisture.I printed up three sheets on my 3 year old Canon imageCLASS MF3240 Monochrome Laser All-in-One Printer and they were clear. perfectly aligned (Avery makes good. free. downloadable software). that peeled off easily to apply to my Christmas card envelopes.  This is the perfect size for address labels.I didn't have a chance to bring up my print list for over a year after I ordered these labels but time doesn't seem to affect Avery labels in the least.  I recommend Avery labels for any purpose. actually."
6,"Avery labels are always great and these are no exception to that rule. They are bright white. feed smoothly through our laser printers and perform just as you would want on paper. When using such labels on cardboard. I recommend another brand. Other brands actually work better on tough surfaces due to stronger adhesive but for envelopes and simple task Avery labels can't be beat. One Avery advantage is how easy they are to peal off the sheet before they are applied which comes from their unique adhesive.MAKE SURE you are buying the correct type of label for your printer. Most households use INK JET printers not a LASER PRINTER which is what these are designed for. That makes a big difference as the wrong type for your printer will make a mess and just plain not work."
6,"These shipping labels work great for recycling mailers.  I've used them to mail several packages & it's a great convenience to no longer have to spend five minutes or more trying to peel off old labels before re-using padded mailers.With Avery's TrueBlock technology. it's a snap to quickly print a label that completely covers the old label. These labels work just like conventional laser labels--just use Avery's template to print the labels you need.  The 'magic' is in the dark. vinyl-like coating on the 'sticky side' of the label.  This dark screening coat completely blocks out the label underneath. so nothing shows through.  Just a clean. neatly printed new. bright white label.Elegantly engineered recycling solution; Highly recommended!"
6,"It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use.  They're an Avery product. so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them. so formatting the print data is a snap.  What makes these labels different is their construction.  They're thicker than the typical mailing label. with a white front and a dark gray sticky side.  This makes the labels truly opaque. so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over.  I've tried to see through them. and I haven't been able to.  This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees."
6,"These are great. functional labels at a very reasonable price.  The 2x4-inch size is big enough for hand-written addresses and still fits 10 to a sheet for economy's sake. many more labels per sheet than the slightly larger sizes without much loss of usability.  The 'TrueBlock' ability to hide what's behind them -- seemingly due to a gray layer behind the labels' white surface. like primer under a coat of paint -- is nice. though this was never a real problem for other labels to begin with.  Simply put. these work great for their purpose."
6,"These labels are exactly what they say they are- truly blocking. We use them within our elementary school reading program. Finally. we have labels that allow for reuse of pocket portfolios without compromising the identity of its previous owner. Besides. no one wants to use a folder that has the shadow of a name behind your own!  These labels look good. save us money and time. At home. we use them when reusing shipping envelopes and boxes. My co-workers. husband. and students love them and you will too!"
6,"How many times have I used a magic marker to cover an old package label... lots! I was surprised and very pleased to see these labels with TrueBlock Technology! It works! A real time saver and no more ink on my fingers from the marker. Add a package of these labels to your shipping arsenal. And. if your word processing software doesn't have a template for them. you can download it from Avery's website.Once you use them. I bet you'll be sure to keep a supply on hand. Highly recommended."
6,"A long time user of Avery labels. I was especially drawn to these because of the promise of smudge-free labels with sheets that pass easily.  I have a finicky. but expensive. printer that on occasion wrinkles sheets that pass through the manual. non-drawer feeder.  This happens most frequently with labels.  So I was happy to see that after using more than 2 dozen of these sheets that they do indeed pass smoothly as described. furthermore no smudging!!!  This is vitally important as with these big labels pressing them onto envelopes sometimes requires quite a bit of handling.  I'm very happy with these labels and will definitely be switching from the regular 2X4 labels to these with TrueBlock that work seamlessly and smudge-free.Highly recommended!"
6,"These labels are nice. thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them. They're made for reusing packaging/mailers with a more professional appearance than traditional labels. which allow the previous printing to show through. They're completely effective at blocking what they cover. and the print jam-free in my laser printer in both the tray and single-feed input. They peel easily from the backing. and very easy to handle because they're thick and don't roll when you remove them. They are not quite as bright white as the typical label. due to the gray layer on the adhesive side. which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels. They're crisp looking labels. and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something."
6,"I use labels a lot...for postage and for labeling items around the house and in the garage.  These are really easy to use (ALL the avery labels are!). but what I really love about these is that I don't have to peel off the old shipping label if I'm re-using a box or envelope.  These will cover the old label so all that shows is the new information.  BIG time-saver. not to mention the savings that come from re-using boxes and envelopes!"
6,"What can you say these are mailing labels for large envelopes or packages. They are plain white. come in sheets of ten with the usual supporting formats in office suites and online at the Avery website. The one key aspect of these labels that makes them different from the standard labels is the TrueBlock that masks any text that they are laid over. no more seeing through the label to the prior addressee.As far as I am concerned these labels fulfill all of the claims made by Avery and work splendidly. P-)"
6,"As I writer. I am often sending out short story manuscripts to potential markets. I'm a great recycler of envelopes. but I spend far too much time trying to peel and/or scrape off the old labels while trying not to tear into the envelopes. These thick labels (they call it 'TrueBlock Technology') will go right on top of the old labels and cover them up completely. Works like a charm! They're big enough for long addresses or large fonts. and you can even create logo shipping labels with them."
6,"In this yet another superior product from Avery. these laser shipping labels can be accommodated to any size envelope as they are not too big and not too small. so as to  seem not aesthetically fitting.Their actual size is 2' x 4'. guaranteed to be jam free and smudge free (haven't tested this claim extensively yet as I have just begun to use them.  So far they work out fine and my printer likes them).I've often bought small labels for small envelopes. and larger for bigger ones.  Now I don't have to do that anymore. slightly uncomplicating my life.  And that's welcome!These labels also cover any printing underneath should one want to send something out in a used enveloped.  That's a pennysaver!Thanks. Avery. for another fine product."
6,"These Avery labels are specially designed to coverup anything underneath them.  They call this TrueBlock. and if you want to be extra sure that nothing can be seen through the label you put on something then this is valuable.  If you don't need this then these labels would be an unnecessary expense in comparison to ordinary mailing labels.These labels are designed for laser printers. though you could also use them in an inkjet.  Just make sure you set the proper template in your word processor before printing.  These labels are something that I'll have available whenever I need to re-use a package/shipping envelope that has dark writing on it."
6,"I am married to a woman who sells lots of things on Ebay.  She is also very conscious of recycling everything she can.  I work for a company that visual appeal when shipping something is almost everything. so when I reuse something. it better look new.  Sometimes. my wife asks me to package something up for her using an old packing envelope. that's fine but I either have to remove the old label or place the new one over the old one allowing you to see the old info.  To compromise. we decided to try these labels and much to my surprise. I can't see the old label under this one.  Yes they are a little more expensive. but it does make our marriage a little better."
6,"Most labels these days are just good labels.  However. if you are looking for labels that will be printed in a laser printer. I'll recommend Avery's products. as I've had great results with them.  No paper jams in my HP color laser printer. and no paper jams in my HP black and white laser printer. The labels separate nicely from their backing. and they stick nicely.These labels are designed by Avery with what they call. 'TrueBlock(TM) Technology' - and I have to agree. if you stick these over the top of an existing label. these will cover them well. and you won't see the label underneath it showing through.  If the box has some writing on it. and you stick this label over the writing. you will not see the writing through this label.  Nice!"
6,"These are nice shipping labels if you do a bunch of shipping from your computer.  Each sheet has 10 stickers on it. generally one for 'From'. and one from 'To'. although you can configure however you want.Avery's 'True Block' tech is basically a sticker with a solid background. so you could put it on top of an old shipping label on a box you might be re-using. and you can't see the old label.  Generally. I don't ship re-used boxes. so that part isn't so much a big deal. but it's nice that it's there.  It also gives the sticker a more solid feel. like it isn't going to come off the box.I've had Avery labels for awhile. and have liked them.  These are good. I'd buy 'em for sure."
6,"These do. in fact. perform as advertised.  They run through my laser printer cleanly and adhere well. blocking things underneath (I tested it on a white box that had black sharpie on it; the sharpie was obscured by the label 100%).  They are a bit small for my box-shipping needs (I use the half-sheet labels for that) but for mailing correspondence to the same address every month. it's quite easy to run off the addresses on a sheet of these labels and keep them with my stamps."
6,"These are white shipping labels...but THESE are good quality ones that don't peel off.  They are 2 inches x 4 inches. and come 10 labels per sheet.  They can go through your printer for mass mailings using an Avery template. or you can simply peel. stick. and and write on one...no bleeding if you use a permanent marker. either.  Even if I don't always use these for shipping. they are great stick on labels for most anything.  I often will cut them up into smaller pieces for this or that purpose.  And they are thick enough that you can't read anything underneath them...a big plus no matter what you use them for."
6,"I received these labels from the Amazon Vine Program. and was eager to give them a try.  I've used Avery products for many years and love that they have use common templates for printing at home.These labels are great for addressing envelopes or boxes you've previously used.  The 'TrueBlock' technology means that there's no show-through of the previous address.  They stick securely and look professional on the front of even a used envelope.  I'll look for more of these when they're gone.  Thanks. Avery. and thanks Amazon!"
6,"These labels looked as if they would be perfect for my Christmas packages and I was correct. I like to save boxes in which I have received shipments for later use to send birthday and Christmas gifts through the mail. but often they have markings and barcodes on them. In the past I have just used a heavy black marker to blot out these things. This is a much better alternative. The labels are sturdy. took printer ink well. and are opaque so that nothing can be seen through them. I like any product that helps me to recycle."
6,"Generally. my main complaint about labels is the poor quality glue that's used and their inability to stick to anything other than a narrow range of paper types. Most Avery labels can stick to a wide variety of materials ranging from paper to pained surfaces to plastic and these are no exception.As advertised. they are very opaque and anything underneath will generally not show through. If you hold the label up to the light. you might be able to make out what was underneath--but otherwise you can't see through it.They feed through printers without issue (even color lasers that may snake the labels through several rollers) and peel of cleanly.Do you need Avery labels for everything? No. not really. But you are definitely getting a better product for the money."
6,"Sure. you can get other label brands but you can't get Avery QUALITY anywhere else.  If you want a product that wont peel off when you don't want it to (like in your printer or at the post office) one that gives crisp imaging and conforms to the templates you have with your label program or word processing software. and one that presents well to the recipient. then stick to Avery and you won't be sorry.  These labels are a prime example of what I'm talking about.  I often reuse large envelopes. mailers. and boxes.  These labels go on clean right over the top of the old ones with no see-through to confuse the delivery person.  They are also great for sticking over bar codes and routing notes."
6,"Avery never fails to produce quality. easy to use labels and these are no exception.  As with any Avery label. these work seamlessly with the templates built into Word.  This particular type with 'TrueBlock Technology' and be pasted right over previous labels so envelopes and boxes can be reused without having to peel off the old label.  They guarantee nothing will show through (like an old bar code) and mess up your shipment.  Nice feature and very 'green'  which I always appreciate!  Kudos. Avery!"
6,"Avery has done it again!  Been using their product for years and I think these are a good improvement over prior functionality.I did use the template and verified that the printing surfaces were clean and ready to go prior to use.  In this way. the labels printed smoothly and easily.  There was not smudging.  The labels did not get stuck in the printer.As the sheet includes just labels (no margins). they peeled off easily and could be subsequently appliedquickly and neatly to the packages.  The finished look was neat and very professional and ready for mailing.Overall.  these are terrific  address labels for any user."
6,"I ship a lot of books and packages in re-used envelopes and packaging. In the past. I've always had to use an additional piece of paper. or a dark marker. to cover up the old address. That's not the case with Avery's shipping labels with TrueBlock technology.These amazing labels effectively cover up any existing label or writing. making it impossible to see the previous address. It might sound like a small feature. but for this shipper it's a time-saver.And. since they're the dependable Avery brand. I can simply enter the package number into my printing program and know that it will print the labels without fail. You can't go wrong."
6,"These 'Avery White Shipping Labels' are perfect for my use.  Before I got these. I used two address labels on all my postage: One for the address of the person with whom I am corresponding and another for my return address.With this label I am able to fit my return address on the upper left side of the label  and the shipping address on the lower right side of the label.One of the nice things about Avery products is that a person can get a template free that works well with each specific product.  In this case a person can get Avery template 5163 (template and software) on the internet.  I have used Avery templates for many years and found them perfect for the designed label (in this case label 5263).I recommend 'Avery White Shipping Labels for Laser Printers'.  This is a quality product."
6,"I'm loving how the rings are the connecting to each other with the pin. That is such a better idea over other binders out there. also the ease of how they open and the side mounted binder instead of the back panel. So much better.The printable tabs are a great little add as well. I can redo them as I like and I can even handwrite on them as well. Plus the fact that all you have to do it line up over your set of tabs and just push them down. Makes life so much easier in general.....This is the perfect item for those of us with a little OCD when it comes to organizational issues...lolall binders should have the level of quality that this product offers."
6,"I recvd Avery lavel dividers and heavy duty EZD ring binder.  Cool.Over the years I've printed out many a label via Avery to use on their dividers.  Both the labels and templates are easy-peasy. One template prints a row of labels together; the other individual labels. Templates are at Avery.com. Easy to download and use... Clean. crisp printing w/ jet printer. No more guessing if the labels are loaded correctly...  The dividers are white and strong.Now the EZD Ring binder is very impressive... The info says it holds over 600 pages... And it really is one-touch... It has sleeves front and back on the inside. And clear sleeves on the front. back and side on the outside. The better to label and see what you're looking for...  Nice..."
6,"The product is good quality and the idea pretty handy.  But adding labels individually to a tab is not really that stressful for me.I would like to see the dividers made out of thicker paper or a cardstock. I use these kinds of dividers at work and flipping through them on a daily basis wears them out very quickly.  The 3 ring binder with the labels is a nice addition and fairly stout and should last a while.If you like the idea of printing your labels out and applying them in a strip. this product will work."
6,"This was a great product to give your index dividers a professional touch.  Clean. crisp and transparent labels looked like something you'd get from a quality print shop and far beyond that of the typical SOHO user.  Unfortunately. the product is really designed to print a page of 100 labels at a time.  Printing just a few simply isn't a good use of this product as the paper does become harder to feed in the printer over time and aligning a small set of labels proved difficult.To print the labels. you open up a Microsoft Word template and manually type on the labels you want to print on.  For just a few labels for office use. this was simply more trouble than it was worth.  However. I did create a series of client presentations and the labels were invaluable for that.Highly recommend for your next project. but skip it for daily use"
6,"I'm not exactly sure what I am reviewing. since Avery sent a special kit to the Vine reviewers that consisted of a 1.5' Heavy-Duty One Touch EZD 3-ring binder and the tabs.The EZD binder is made very well. with an easy to use ring locker.The Easy Apply tabs come in strips of 5 that allow you to label 5 tabs in one fast stroke. perfect for the office commandos that need to file stuff on a daily basis. The kit also comes with a tab sheet that allows you to print tabs using a Word template. All of these tabs are self-adhesive. so it saves you time from having to hunt down lost inserts.Avery comes up with nifty ways of organizing information and this is not an exception."
6,"This binder comes with clear label index maker dividers. Microsoft Word can be used to print on all the label strips with the computer. When you print the labels. peel and align on the divider definitely looks more professional. It can be used for home filing. school papers or office. It is easy and less time-consuming compared to writing all the labels by hand. Label seems thick and index divider sheets are also thick. Strip that is holding the ring is thick to hold the ring strongly. It has 2 pockets on each inner side in the binder where we can keep some additional papers or pen."
6,"I choose this Avery product because I have been pleased with their products in the past. I was not disappointed!It's easy to go online. type in the number of the product. test it and then print. The user can choose between programs that can be downloaded or used online. I was using a computer other than my own so I went for the online program. It had a good number of choices and clear instructions. My only problem was that a small amount of the design on each label was cut off. It didn't really detract from the product and I probably could have changed it after my test copy if I had wanted.If you have any problems. there are several resources to find help including 'help' tabs on each page. online chat and phone numbers. I also like that this product is made of 30% post consumer products.BEST OF ALL it is easy to apply 5 labels at once. With the arthritis in my hands. this is a major plus!"
6,"In the early days of my company we would work like mad to make up proposal section separation sheets that indicated the quality and professional that we were trying to present with our proposals.  We finally gave up and purchased separate stiff sheets that were professional printed with the desired section title; i.e.. Personnel. Technical Understanding. Approach. etc.  Invariably the government would change the section titles every time we started a new proposal. so there were no scale economies available to 'over stocking' separation sheets.Had I had this Avery product available. it would be an simple task to  change proposal section titles to match the latest government desires. yet still have a professional looking proposal. What a tremendous idea.  Well worth the cost and simple to implement."
6,"This is an excellent product that makes an ordinarily tedious job much easier.  The trick is the 'Easy Apply label strips.' which allow you to print all five index tab labels at one time using a Word template that Avery makes available online.  Once they're printed. you just peel the group of labels off of the sheet and press the labels onto the folder tabs.  There's also a set of individual labels if you don't need sets of five.  It takes less time to do it than it takes to read this explanation.  The dividers themselves seem very sturdy. and they should survive pretty rough handling in a notebook.A new way of doing divider tab labels isn't going to change the world. but this Avery product makes life just a little easier.  Bottom line:  Well worth the money."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"These work great and make it very easy to put together multiple dividers (front and back) at a time. The added bonus is that I am able to get them all on straight because I have a longer line to follow as I am attaching them. I only wish I did not have to use the Avery website to print the labels. They used to supply a disk with previous purchases I have made and the disk included the application needed. I wish I could just download the app to my system so I did not have to learn how to navigate their website. Too complicated for just the few labels I want to print.Overall if you are putting together lots of labels it could be worth your time. There was also the ability to add graphics to the labels."
6,"This divider/label kit helps you step by step through the process of printing labels for your dividers. either with a downloaded Word template (which I used. with Word 2003) or online.  (Word 2007 comes with the template already. according to the package.)  Once you download it. it will appear under an 'Avery' tab when you open the 'New Office Document' menu.  I tried printing both text and picture labels. and fed the label sheet twice through the printer - it came out looking great and was as easy to apply as in the photo.  You can also print labels for both the fronts and backs of your tabs at the same time.  There is even a test printing sheet as well as extra labels to attach separately in case you want to reuse old dividers.  The binder is also very nice. with a rubber-coated lever and two pockets inside both the front and back covers."
6,"You can count on Avery to bring to market an excellent heavy-duty three-ring binder that can be depended upon to be easy-to-manipulate and hold-up to the abuse inherent in office work.I particularly like the plastic cover over the push tab to use open-and-close the rings to place the dividers and paper in. With free templates and software to make the index tab dividers and a study 3-ring binder to put materials in this is a good. solid. dependable product. The rings themselves appear to match up perfectly.Bottom line? Buy this heavy duty 3-ring binder you won't have to struggle ever again to open and close the rings like you do on most."
6,"Getting divider labels to look good has been one of my challenges. If you need dividers for presentations or just to look good it's almost impossible to get most labels to print out with the right alignment. Others I've tried I had to waste a whole sheet to get a couple of labels printed.These clear labels with the templates worked fantastic. The templates. printing. and results were flawless. The dividers themselves are tough. reinforced. bright white. and very crisp. I make binders and presentation materials that I can be proud of - and for my sales efforts help me win by being a notch better than my competitors. One of the few products that I use consistently and would not think of changing from."
6,"This 3 Ring Binder is well designed. Avery took what is wrong with most other binders and came up with excellent solutions such as the Pins for the Binder Ring connections. Other binders use V connections which don't always work well. I also like the Single Button to release the Rings. The curvature of the Rings makes it easier to handle large volumes of paper.The Labels are also Premium quality but I won't be using them with a printer or the free Avery software. Only reason is that I don't make that many Binder labels at any one time. But I have used other Avery label products with Avery's free software and they always worked well.If you want an above average 3 Ring Binder that can be used frequently and smoothly then I highly recommend this Avery product."
6,"The binder is a nice quality easy-touch 3-ring. But what makes this set especially nice is the dividers. Included are 5 sets of 5. with one set of traditional labels. one set of 'easy labels.' and one practice sheet. Templates are downloadable from Avery.The easy-tabs ensure that the divider labels align. which is a nice touch. I'm going to see if I can pick these up in colored labels -- that would be sweet and perfect for how I use this product (essentially a career portfolio)."
6,"Not only did I use these for notebook dividers. I used them to label file folders.  They fit and look great with some minor adjustments (putting one folder inside another).  One of the nicest aspects of using these for dividers is the straight placement.  I think they look much nicer than anything I've used before.  I have several notebooks that have over 25 dividers. so the time I saved creating and applying the labels is very much appreciated. I also took advantage of the fact that I could play around with section titles to see which would fit best.Avery labels are about all I can get either at my local Staples and Wal-Mart stores.  (I don't even know who else makes them anymore.) I'll be buying these again."
6,"I used various book stands similar to these for several years. until I got my big desk. and I needed something to hold BIG books open. For that I got four of the deluxe book stands in wood. which could hold the largest study Bible. But now. that BIG desk is filled with monitors. and I have far less room for beefy book stands. Enter these small stands which. by the way. are perfect for Kindles. and which can fold away when not in use. They have an air of delicacy. but if you use them carefully. they have an important role in the changing face of bookpropology."
6,"I like this. It holds books well. It is holding up well and gets the job done. It is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read. Not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback. The flipklip is great for doing that. This one is more of a 'I have to type from a textbook onto my computer' kind of thing. It holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary. This one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot. for learning to type and it holding the book open. for hardbacks that you just don't want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you. things like that."
6,"This is a very cool product made with just three pieces of stainless steel.It folds up into a very small space and holds a small to medium sized book in a near-vertical. open-face position with a certain panache.But if you're working from a very thick book. you need a different bookstand. The convenience disappears when you have to be finessing some of the pages of a large book onto the outside of the vertical 'placeholder' and the rest of them on the inside.I like the idea. 'Shame they don't make a large size. too."
6,"I've used one of these for decades. all the way back to my university days. and it's definitely an old and dear friend. So much so that I recently bought a new one when the little rubber tips finally wore out on the old one.This book holder works really well for any kind of hardback. even a big dictionary. However. in my experience it doesn't work very well for trade paperbacks. They flop forward and don't hold at all well. If you want a really wonderful book holder for that purpose. I recently discovered theBookbax(which is also good for holding the Kindle and Kindle Fire and other tablet readers)."
6,"I often take notes on the computer while I'm reading. and it's hard to hold them open to the right page and type at the same time.A friend suggested I pick up one of these. and it works quite well. It's inexpensive and easily folds up so that you can throw it in a bag.For my office. though. I ended up buying a more durable wooden stand. The problem with this stand is that while it will easily hold a book open to a specific page it is not as easy to switch pages. It's not hard. though. and for its ease of use and its portability I would recommend one of these to any student or scholar on a budget."
6,"I like the idea that you can lay this copy stand flat and store it when not in use. and that you can even put a book in the brackets and it will hold it open while you type. (they give you around 1 1/2 inches). I also like that it's simple in it's design. all metal with plastic end pieces. The one flaw with this is that they need a piece going up through the center and topping it by about five inches since regular paper just folds over the top of the stand. I did remedy this by putting a metal ruler through it and it works fine. But even so. what was Fellowes thinking when they designed it? Just that one piece and it would be a five star."
6,"I see too many negative comments. It's 5 bucks. How powerful of a book stand do you want for 5 bucks? No it doesn't lock. No it doesn't hold 2000 page dictionaries. However....Yes. it's 5 bucks....Yes. it holds a college books....Yes. it stays still (even without a lock!). Good stuff for 5 bucks. It holds a book.If you're thinking this will hold a large book. it won't. A large hardcover book. like a certification book. would have to be less than 400 pages to fit in here. The only way it would fit a large dictionary. as pictured. would be if you opened it to the middle page and never wanted to read any place else."
6,"I got this new mouse pad/wrist rest when I got my new trackball mouse. I had read the reviews and I was impressed by the reviews that said the gel did not compress like the foam types.So far. my expectations have been met. The wrist rest is comfortable and it does not compress like my old foam one did.Being as I use a trackball. I did have one problem. My trackball mouse slid all over the pad when I pressed a button. I would expect that to be good news for people who use the traditional roll around type of mouse.My solution was to buy a set of those round non-slip jar openers for the kitchen. One of them under my mouse completely solved the slipping problem.I like this mouse pad/wrist rest so much that I bought a gel pad wrist rest for my keyboard. They are both great!"
6,"I bought these to print out pictures. cut them up into puzzle pieces. and place them on a magnetic rectangle so they can be rearranged into the right places. The magnet they are placed on is pretty substantial (at least the thickness of all 5 sheets of this paper). and the puzzle pieces stick fine when the whole thing is lying on a table. but when I lift it up sometimes the pieces fall off!I tried sticking a piece on my fridge and it wouldn't stay--and the packaging says it will stick AND hold up a piece of paper on most metal surfaces. I couldn't get it to stick at all! And the magnetic paper just stuck on a good magnet doesn't even stay very well when it's lifted off the table so that gravity is affecting the pieces. Overall. it works fine for my purposes because the puzzles are meant to stay on a table. but I just can't see any use for them beyond that."
6,"This is a basic stand for a monitor.  It's just a curved metal tube with a metal plate affixed to the top.  The first one I got was defectively assembled -- the metal plate on top was crooked. badly out of square.  I returned it. and the replacement is much better.The color is a sort of metallic black.  There is a gray Allsop logo painted on in raised letters on the front right part of the tube.It gets the job done and looks decent enough."
6,"If you own a laptop and use an external LCD monitor or you are just looking to sneak some small peripherals or desk accessories beneath your monitor or an inkjet printer. look no further. The MetalArt Jr. is a classy alternative to molded plastic stands intended for beafier CRT monitors. I ordered the product to use as a stand for a 17&quot; LCD monitor. Not only does it raise the monitor to the ideal height. but it is spaced perfectly to store my IBM T40 laptop and docking station neatly beneath. The perforated metal at the top of the stand allows air to flow freely and keeps both the laptop and monitor cool.The description doesn't give the dimensions of the stand. which are very important since its size is not traditional. so I'll list them here (from the manufacturer): 11&quot; x 15&quot; x 4.5&quot;."
6,"The item holds my new 22 inch LCD just fine.It doesn't bounce and shake if knocked. so the monitor is nice and safe.We bought three and all three came with cheap. sloppy paint jobs. So to match my all black computer I spray painted them and it looks like I bought it that way.The space under is perfect for my Logitech Wave Keyboard to slid out of the way or a nice place to throw those pads of sticky notes. pens and whatnots.OVERALL:We've bought one for all three family members and its been great to gain some desk space and ensure we are more ergonomic by having the monitor at the correct hight for the desk/chair setup. Its the cheapest metal unit I could find and it holds up under the weight just fine."
6,"I needed more space for 'digital devices'. I have a laser printer and needed a place to put the office scanner I just purchased. This fits perfectly on top of the printer without making the printer unusable. The paper comes out of the printer and the scanner sits right on top of this awesome device.The stand is metal and very sturdy. It can easily hold an old CRT monitor... though. who even has one nowadays?It is marketed as a monitor stand. but you can (obviously) use it wherever you want and put whatever you want on it."
6,"Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes. and I'm very happy with them. The paper works flawlessly with my printer (Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer). and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing. The cards can be printed on front and back. which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them. or else you'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer. at least. isn't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll"
6,"I've been a user of 3 x 5 cards for decades. There's always a stack of them in my shirt pocket. though I do admit to not using them consistently.Right now. I'm working on a project that requires me to catalog dozens of snippets from various sources and then integrate them into my writing. Typical outlining programs won't handle this well. so it's back to the index cards. Fortunately. one of my outlining programs handles output to the Avery cards.You can also use them with Microsoft Word. FileMaker. Access and any other program that lets you format your print output.These things tear neatly and accept laser or inkjet output.Brutally expensive when compared to ordinary index cards. but incomparably handy. Worth the price when you need a foolproof method of printing index cards. The regular ones often don't get along with some - actually many - printers.Jerry"
6,"TheBelkin F8E089-BLK 8-by-9-Inch Mouse Pad (Black)is the first mouse pad I have purchased in a decade or so. and it is the only one I have ever had that actually worked well with optical mice. Occasionally. it will not track correctly. and I have to give the mouse an extra nudge. but so far this has been a rare occurrence. The only problem I have had was that the mouse pad reeked of chemicals (the rubber bottom?) when I removed it from the box. but that has almost entirely dissipated. If I put my nose next to it I can still detect the smell. though. Someone with a sensitive nose might be bothered."
6,"Yep - it stinks.  Smells like old rubber and stinky cigars.  I was surprised at how noxious the smell was.  I've own/used plenty of mouse pads over the years and never noticed any type of nasty smell to them.  They generally don't smell at all.  I ended up putting this one in the cold garage for a few days and now the smell isn't as noticeable.  If it really bothers you. you could try putting it in a bag with a dryer sheet.  Otherwise. it's a mouse pad and works like a mouse pad should.  Just don't understand why it smells so bad."
6,"I had a similar style (fabric-over-rubber) mouse pad since the 90s that I got from a store as a 'gift with purchase'.  It worked with both ball and optical mice. but it started to peel from age.  My old employer had some promotional pads made from vinyl and I couldn't believe how much build-up generated on the bottom of the mice.Found these here at Amazon and ordered 3 - this is exactly what I wanted... a durable fabric-over-rubber mouse pad. perfect size for the desk. inexpensive. and functional.  No markings or logos on it. just plain black.  Couldn't ask for better."
6,"A lot of people (myself included) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition. However. what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So. I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better. they're thicker. they block out what is underneath better. and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply. for laser or injet labels. Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
6,"They have done excellent job of shipping. It came right even before they said and we are on  two opposite coasts in USA. Good job of packing and shipping. My only complain is they said when I looked last time that I bought the last of this label. If they continue the way they have done for me. They will have my business. See price is everything. I have been using these labels for years so I do  know if they are good or not. I know they are. I know they come in two forms one is high gloss other is not. Not sure which one I got it is not at home."
6,"Now that I've finally learned to read and follow directions. I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly.  Every time I empty the waste bucket. I spray a bit of this lube on the cutters. and run them forward and reverse.  So far. my latest shredder is running smooth as silk. with this simple bit of prevent. maintenance.The oil itself seems very good. no smell or spatter when I'm lubing the cutters.  And a little bit goes a long way."
6,"There is a lot of debate on whether you should just buy cheap canola oil for your shredder or more expensive shredder oil.  I'm sure both work fine. but is the $5-6 price tag on this really worth taking the chance?  For a moderate home user. 12oz of Shredder Oil will last probably longer than your shredder (maybe two shredders).  I for one think that this is a small price to pay to protect my $250+ Fellowes Micro Cut Shredder.  As far as the product goes. it works great.  I have had my shredder for a couple of years with moderate use and there has been no build-up of oil or slow downs in its function.  It is still working as well and as quiet as it did on the first day.  I use the oil every bag change or if I haven't used it in a few weeks.  Great product at a reasonable price."
6,"This oil comes in a plastic container with a nozzle that makes it easy to lubricate the shredder. Yes. it is outrageously priced but it does the job it supposed to do. I just don't believe a product should be given a poor rating because of the price. I do believe that price is a factor in the purchase decision but not in the product itself. But. that's just my opinion. When I run out of the Fellowes lubricant I will refill the container with vegetable oil because of the price but not because of the quality of the Fellowes oil."
6,"We've used this for two years with our shredder. and the machine still shreds just fine. so I guess it works as advertised.  The only drawback is that it is a little messier than the lubricated sheets used for the same purpose.Other than the cleanliness of the sheets (1.33/sheet. a new one to be used every time the basket is emptied). I don';t think they're as cost effective as the oil.  It's cheap. it'as easy and it stares at me from my shelf so I won't forget to use it."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
6,"The only reason I bought this product is because of the bottle.  I could not find a bottle with a long nozzle in my area.  I'll be refilling the bottle with cheap vegetable oil.  I couldn't even find this product in local office supply stores.  The only thing I could find was a pack of ten sheets of paper impregnated with soybean oil for $9.99.  I left the store in a huff that somebody would even think of charging that kind of money for soybean oil. There is simply no need for it."
6,"We've been using those oil-filled sheets that you run through the shredder every so often to lube it up. I found this. at a much. much lower cost. and figured I'd give it a shot. expecting a small bottle of oil similar to ones I've seen at the store. Nope. This is a full-size. 12 oz bottle. which is a LOT of shredder oil. at least for our home use. I figure it will last at least a year. and likely 2-3.Careful cutting off the tip - it's just like a tube of caulk. and if you cut off too much. you'll have a hard time controlling it. Other than that. it's easy to apply. with a nice long nozzle. flows easily. and works great."
6,"Breathed new life into my shredder............. Mine was getting stuck and binding up. Constantly had to pick out the paper that got stuck in the teeth. or 'back it out' and re-try.  Put a pin hole in the tip ( took someones advise and didn't cut the tip off) and drizzled it along the teeth.  Ran several sheets through and my cross cut micro shredder has come back to life.  I had no idea shredders needed this kind of maintenance.I'll be adding lube to the teeth every couple of months. and the bottle I got was huge.  Will last me the rest of this shredders life.  Got the product very fast too. thanks to my Prime Membership"
6,"I never oiled my previous shredder and paid the price after about a year.  This time I bought the oil at the same time I bought the shredder.  Now I oil the shredder fairly often. maybe even too often.  The only issue I have with this product is that it's a bit messy when you &#34;pour&#34; the oil onto the shredder blades.  I cut the top of the oil container as small as I could. but oil still manages to come out too fast and get on the shredder body when I oil.  No big deal as I just wipe the excess with a paper towel. but it's worth noting."
6,"I only have a super cheap-o shredder from wal mart of something. I got this oil because I read that it really helps shredders work longer. Regular lubricating oils technically help with the lubrication. but the paper dust gets stuck to regular oils and clog up the machine. creating a different problem. Shredder oil is supposedly specially created so that this won't happen. So I figured it was worth a shot. I've now had my crappy shredder for years. I will eventually get a nicer one and there is so much oil in the bottle I won't have to get more. But I think my shredder would have died long ago if it wasn't for this lubricating oil made for shredders."
6,"It is as claimed. A light odorless lubricant that improves the cutting of the shredder blades. After shredding about ten bags of paper I used this lubricant and immediately noticed a difference in the sound of the shredder motor and there was no &#34;oil&#34; smell. A hint that I learned is to put the shredder in reverse and then apply the lubricant and let it run for about 10 SECONDS. When you puncture the spout be sure to use a small pin. If you cut the tip off you will use too much."
6,"This stuff came as a surprise to me thru an order of a new Fellows shredder. I ordered the new machine because my last shredder was gasping it's death rattle. In researching the new Fellows machine. I began to see comments about the need to lubricate these things and so when I ordered the Fellows. I also ordered the lubricant. After receiving it. I had a brainstorm that maybe if I tried it on the old dying rattletrap shredder. it might do it some good. Wow! This stuff brought the old machine back to life. I have had several shredders die prematurely over the years and never had an inkling that they might need some simple lubricant.If you have a shredder. any shredder. buy this stuff and try it out. Can't hurt. can it?"
6,"I've now owned two shredders.  The first one. I decided didn't need to be oiled -- despite the owners manual telling me otherwise.  What do I care if the blades are oily?  They just spin and cut. right?  I never have to oil my scissors......wrong.  After a while (albeit a few years). the shredder blades simply stopped working.  Paper was getting stuck in the strangest of places and I guess the motor eventually burned out.Enter the second shredder and a new bottle of Fellowes Shredder Oil.  I'm following the manual with this one and you should too.  Different oils are meant for different purposes. so get one that's meant for a metal shredder.  This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long. long. time."
6,"I wouldn't say it is a stupid mistake. to think you cut off the tip of the dispenser as ever other product that is designed this way is designed to be cut off. but DO NOT CUT OFF THE TIP. You should punch a hole in the end of it with a needle. I found this out the hard way. but I suppose they saved money on packaging by designing it this way.Overall it is a great product. my shredder is already performing better now that it is lubed up. As this is just a home shredder I feel this size of a bottle will last for years and will also extend the life of my shredder. Would probably give it 4.5 stars just as a light knock for the bottle design. but as long as you know not to cut it you will have no problems."
6,"Fellowes has stated that this really is just standard vegetable (canola) oil however they have tested and fully approved it for their shredders.On page 4 of my Fellowes 79CI manual it states. 'Only use a non-aerosol vegetable oil in long nozzle container such as Fellowes 35250' which is this oil. It probably works great for other brands of shredders too.I'm just using the tiny bottle of this that came included with myFellowes Powershred 100% Jam Proof 79Ci 14 Sheet Cross-Cut Paper Shredder (3227901). When it runs out. I will buy this larger bottle which should last several years. just to have a nicer bottle/applicator. And then when that runs out. I will refill this bottle with grocery store canola oil. which is a better value.But really. this large bottle should last years unless it's being used in a very high volume corporate shredder or something like that. So. it's not all that expensive considering."
6,"I have a bad lower back and currently enrolled in physical therapy. I have pain going down the back of one leg. To me it seemed as though propping up that foot alleviated the foot pain. I had a more expensive foot rest in my cart and decided to give a cheaper model a try first to see if it cut down on my leg pain. FWIW - It has a bit. but not entirely. now onto the review.As others alluded to. this is an expensive piece of plastic. It is very cheaply made. It has two levels that you can chose from a higher or lower resting level. This has a rocker like motion so that you're feet aren't in a set position all the time. However. this rocking motion is not fluid. and is downright noisy.It does tend to stay in place well. and serves its purpose. I would say that there are better choices out there."
6,"This is not of the same quality as the Kensington foot rest.  I now have both it and this one.It is a smaller version and does not have the same range of motion and comfortable gel foot pads.BUT. it is far cheaper.So in balancing the function versus the price it is a very acceptable solution to leg pain when working for prolonged periods at a computer desk.I was needing another foot rest at my L shaped computer desk but did not want to pay the high price of the Kensington model.When balancing the cost and usability of this foot rest I am pleased with my purchase.  It provides most of the same qualities of the more expensive options.  It is worth the price asked and I find it to be restful."
6,"I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up!  The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright.  Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder. I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure.  The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far. but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily.  I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides. or white board on one side and flip chart on the other.  Very versatile."
6,"We have been using this particular DryErase/Flip Chart outside of our store for 2 years now. We do not use it as an 'Easel.' but rather as a hanging board (where it hangs downward) to promote specials and products.After purchasing another product that didn't work. we were especially grateful to purchase this particular one. It is sturdy. and except in high winds. we do not have a problem with it blowing over. Best of all. we can write on both sides - either turning it sideways so it can be seen by cars / Pedestrians coming from either direction. or facing front. with the ability to turn it later in the day to promote a different sale (especially helpful for Thanksgiving day sales).As a small business owner. I appreciate the flexibility of being able to promote items without a lot of hassle. and this particular chart has been especially helpful to us."
6,"The Quarter Easel Whiteboard and Flipchart is perfect for  Sunday School at my church. I like the double sided writing surface and angled feature for good viewing across the classroom. I just wish I could get one for every classroom. The board is very sturdy and well built. It does take two people to set it up and secure the legs. The double-sided white board makes it a reversible writing space. It also will hold the Easel Pads 27 x 34 Inch. I highly recommend this easel whiteboard for a small office or  classroom use."
6,"Whenever I have a study group at my house. it drives me bonkers to have to demonstrate everything on a piece of paper. This easel style whiteboard is stupid easy to set up. It comes assembled already. All you do is adjust the height to where you want it. and tighten the knobs so it stays put. Then. it stays exactly where you put it until you're ready to adjust it again. You can write on both sides. Both top and bottom have the little marker holding tray on it. The legs spread out so that the easel stays nice and stable on the ground. This makes life so much easier to study. because everything is right there."
6,"Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!"
6,"This is my new best friend. This thing is awesome.The Quartet Ultima easel is adjustable. I can adjust it to whatever setting I need . It even can be used as a table top but I don't use it that way.  It is easy to move. We have dragged this all over the house and out to the barn to list the days work or anything else. It is so stable. we used it on a float in a parade. It wipes of easily. And the frame seems like it is going to last.I am very pleased"
6,"Yes. you read correctly. this CAN be converted to an actual TABLE!This helps if you need a place to put your projector in a pinch.Very easy to adjust. and very sturdy.This piece is a tad bit &#34;bulky&#34; for me (I am 5'5&#34; tall. and its size competes with my size). but not overly &#34;heavy&#34; as far as weight.Quality is great. and I highly recommend it for presentations. or even just a good writing board for your office."
6,"I am a corporate trainer who has done a lot of volunteer teaching at church.  I've used a lot of this type of product.  There are other styles that are more stable by definition.  But. of the ones that I have used that are this style. this one seems very stable .  You need to learn the rhythm of how to set it up by yourself and it's much easier with more than one set of hands.  But. that's true of the design. not this specific product.  I can do it by myself when the need arises.If you are going to buy one that is this style. this is a good option."
6,"This arrived just in time for me to take to a therapy group I was doing a presentation at. I was amazed how light it was compared to other wooden or metal easels I've used previously. It was relatively easy for me to fold and unfold and carry and set up. Put your foot on the bottom frame. loosen the tightening knobs. and pull up on both sides of the white board at the same time. Tada!  Then tighten into place. Remarkably sturdy! I paid $120 with overnight Prime shipping from Amazon. whereas the identical item was $181 before tax at OfficeMax.  I've only had it a few days. but delighted with it."
6,"Aside from one moderate issue. this freestanding dry erase board is great. The only problem with it is that it can be a bit hard to set up without assistance. The knobs that tighten down both the legs and lock the board at the desired angle are hard to turn while also holding everything where you want it. This is solved by laying the board flat on the ground. or by enlisting someone to assist you. Once set up. the board is perfect: stable. easy to write on. made very well. and light. We use three of them at my work place and all are excellent. This board will fit in the trunk of most cars. so it's great for presentations.4/5. A solid buy even with the somewhat difficult setup."
6,"The Swingline Inspire laminator is wonderful.  The price was great and the usefulness is a ten of ten.  My wife is a school teacher and my daughter. although she. too taught in public schools. now stays home and home schools our grand daughters.  Both of them needed a laminator for preparing teaching aids and other stuff.  These pouches are very convenient and work quite well and I will order more when they run out of them.  My youngest grand daughter has become a super-laminator so I am sure they will need more.  They are simple to use and do a great job of protecting whatever was laminated.  I recommend then and the laminator and these pouches to every household even if they have no children.  They are compact. efficient and just great to have around."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
6,"I finally made the plunge and got a drawer organizer for our bathroom drawer.  My husband and I have a single drawer in our bathroom so it's always quite messy filled with toothpaste. hairbrushes. hair ties. floss. bandaids. and more.This Drawer Organizer does the trick! There is a good variety of compartments that fit all of our items perfectly and I LOVE how deep this organizer is. One of the small compartments holds all of my bobbypins and hair ties perfectly. The longer organizer holds my hairbrush and combs while the middle organizer we keep for toothpaste."
6,"I just needed this to organize clutter such as note pads. discs for my computer. take-out menus. tape. etc. This is slightly larger than I expected. I need to keep it off to the side of my desk instead of on it. It does work as a simple separator. but bends VERY easily. It came with nearly every separator bent out of place. and only took a slight push to bend them back. I suppose this can be good if you want to add a slant. but it can't hold any weight."
6,"Originally I bought this in order to stack a modem and a wireless router. However. when I got it I decided to use it in my office to keep small electronics organized.I put a telephone on the top shelf and then a collection of chargers and adapters on the second shelf. The third shelf has earplugs. small cameras. and other electronics. They're now organized and within easy reach.I like the mesh; it looks good in an office and it would have worked well for the modem and router as it would have allowed air flow at the bottom of the units."
6,"Sorry I cannot wax lyrical about a trash can.  Do NOT put liquids in it.  It is too big for grocery store plastic bag. too small for a kitchen trash can liner - I am going to have to investigate to see what size fits.  I have to have liners in my trash cans!  Good size in that it fits under the desk and holds a lot - but not large like a kitchen trash can.  I have lots of trash!  It is sturdy and can the abuse of being run over or used like a basketball hoop.  I bet your house is not as exciting!"
6,"Sturdy. durable and sleek.  In three words that sums up this wastebasket; it is just fantastic.  Most of my organizers and other office equipment are black and mesh and this coordinates perfectly with them.  Rubbermaid and Rolodex both intermix well especially in this black mesh design.  Comparing prices between local stores and Amazon have this product priced nearly the same.  I bought this at my local store to have it quicker however it's cost effective at the current price of under $10 no matter where you buy it."
6,"I coveted this trash can. which my sister owned for years. until she finally relented and gave it to me. Of course it works perfectly. and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh. That was a concern. as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they'd eat it. My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag. which means every time I empty it. I have to turn it upside down over the bag. This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot. so if I wait until it's full. it's quite heavy. But I don't care. This is just a wonderfully classy. sturdy waste basket!"
6,"I have had two of these trays for a few years.  I did at one point buy the (sold separately) spacers to stack them. but I've never been a fan of stacked trays and abandoned that idea.  I keep these side-by-side on my desk. using them as a pair of 'In' and 'Next' boxes for David Allen's _Getting Things Done_ method of organizing tasks.These perfectly match my cherry desk--so much so that they look like a set.  I have a bunch of the other desk accessories in this series (pencil cups. etc.) and they all look fantastic.  Elegant without the overdone aluminum mesh.  Sturdy. useful. and about the right price if you're on a budget without degrading into black plastic.Highly recommended."
6,"I wanted a large paper trimmer for trimming paper beyond the standard 8 1/2 X 11&#34; without spending a fortune.  I also wanted one that would hold up to use.  This trimmer has met the first need.  Only time will tell how it holds up to use but since I take care of my office equipment I expect that it will.  It's not very heavy overall but the cutting blade has some heft to it.  So far I've only used it to slice some heavy stock paper and that was no effort whatsoever.  The cut is true when you line it up flush with the back edge of the trimmer. It is attractive as well and looks good in the office.  There is a nice metal clip that will lock the blade down when not in use."
6,"This is sharp. cuts and trims very well. and seems sturdy enough for my uses. which are occasional but include matboard and adhesive backed felt.  However I sometimes need to do precise trimming. as when connecting two parts of a template that contains multiple pages. Here it is necessary to join them properly to obtain a correct finished product.  And this is where the lack of a precise 0 reference point is a real drawback.  The rulers start with the one inch mark and there are no markings beween 0 and 1 inch.  There is no easy sight reference. either--a red line. a triangle... one has to guess and then come at 0 in several increments.  This is a pain and unnecessary.  The end of the cutting board is not easy to see once you have paper over it.  I'LL PROBABLY figure out a way to make a visible line but this shouldn't be necessary.  Guess I could hcve bought one with a laser but didn't want to spend the money."
6,"We do a lot for our sons PTA. so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not.  We had a small 6' cutter. that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth. and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from.  The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp' like thing to put on your paper while cutting.  So basically. if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force.  The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving.  However. this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review."
6,"By way of disclosure. I received a sample of this product for evaluation purposes.The only guillotine trimmer I ever used with any frequency was my mother's.  It was a heavy unit. made largely of hardwood with a heavy spring-loaded arm.  It was hardly portable -- it weighed a lot.This Swingline trimmer is much lighter. with the surfaces made of plastic.  It's easy to get it out when you have a job that calls for it.It has a sharp blade that cuts paper cleanly without requiring excessive force.  It is reasonably stable on a table.It can deal with sheets of paper bigger than the standard 8.5&#34;x11&#34; size. having a 15&#34; cutting length.  If you need to trim legal paper lengthwise. this trimmer can do it.Overall. it is a fine trimmer and isn't too expensive.  If you only need a trimmer for occasional use. I'd recommend it."
6,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12&#34;x12&#34;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very. very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses"
6,"I am always on the look out for a cutter that will last.  When this cutter arrived and I opened the box. I found a cutter that was plastic....How long?  I also found that in use. the cutter has not enough weight to hold strong.  And you need to apply pressure so that it can cut....again  How long can this last.I believe that if you are going to use this on occasion and not for heavy duty scrap-booking I might want to consider theunit is mostly plastic and light weight.Could only give 3 stars for this product."
6,"This Swingline Lite Classic Cut is a standard size cutter but is light weight so you can move it around if needed. It's nice to cut coupons or whatever else you may be doing like craft projects. It is easy to move around and store if you have the room. Because it was called &#8220;lite&#8221;. I thought it would be a smaller size but it's just lighter in weight than others that I've used. It still takes up quite a bit of room.It has measurement markings and a grid on the the cutting board to help with measuring and lining up your cutting projects.There is a locking mechanism for the arm which is nice. I have another one that you can not lock the arm in place and I worry about the safety of that one.I noticed that is states it is for the occasional 10-sheet cutting project so I think this would be suited to homework. coupons. etc but may not stand up to daily use in an office or classroom."
6,"First thing you notice taking this out of the box is the weight. quite light. They say 3.6 pounds...hardly. more like 2 lbs 5 oz. or so is the actual cutters weight and it does advertize as 'lite' which  on the plus side makes it quite easy to handle and store. The blade appears to be quite sharp and produced a clean straight line. both on singles and several pages stacked. I have not tried thicker material yet. The locking latch is quite cheap and a weak point. The handle mechanism bolting though plastic sort of makes me wonder how long that will last considering that is where most of the movement occurs. For the money you get a cheaply built cutter that does the job. depending on how much you plan on using it. Granted it is not the industrial. heavy duty wood models and such. just a simple around the home trimmer."
6,"I really like this Swingline Trimmer.  It's very easy to use. lightweight and easier to store than the big. heavy ones.  It performs well. can easily cut ten sheets of paper at a time.  I've used it for a lot of paper crafts. cutting heavy cardstock with ease and accuracy.  The paper is easy to line up. so you get satisfying results.  I've had quite a few trimmers. and they never really lived up to my expectations.  I have a very expensive Martha Stewart trimmer which is a huge disappointment. difficult to line up and and the cuts are often slightly off. which drives me crazy.  This trimmer far surpasses that one. for less than half the price.  I'd highly recommend for scrapbookers and other crafters. for students (with parental supervision. of course).  There is a lockable safety latch on the side to prevent accidents while not in use.  Very pleased with this product."
6,"Very Difficult to get it to make an even cut though!!! EVEN ON A FLAT SURFACE LINING EVERYTHING UP!!! It's like it does what it wants to when it comes to whether it makes a straight cut or one that is angled.But all-in-all it is a good Trimmer.You can even use it to cut up stuff like old credit cards. or IDs. I use it as my own little shredder on documents that have personal information on that I need to throw away. (just a tip)"
6,"The Swingline Classic Cut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmer is exactly what it says. it's LIGHT. and it cuts very well.  The lightness of the product does make it feel a bit cheap. but I think it will hold up just fine....it's a desktop item. not something you're going to throw around or jump on!There are two sets of measuring guides. on at the top of the cutter and another about 5 inches down which is kind of nice. the entire bed of the cutter it filled with grids so it's easy to make sure that your paper is lined up straight. very useful for cutting smaller items.I am very happy with this cutter. a great replacement for my old heavy elephant of a cutter. definitely worth it!"
6,"This replaced a smaller. somewhat flimsier paper cutter and while that one was merely adequate. I feel this one is ideal for home use.  It will accurately and neatly cut up to 10 sheets of standard paper or approximately 5 pieces of medium card stock at a time.  While this may fall short in an office setting. for our needs at home. it does a great job.Although it's considerably lighter. smaller and easier to store. it shares several important features with its more expensive commercial cousins.  It has an alignment grid and a ruler to ensure that your cuts are accurate and it boasts important safety features such as a guard rail and a blade lock to prevent you from cutting something you don't intend to.  And that's a good thing too because the die-cast metal blade is very sharp to begin with and is self-sharpening as well.The Swingline ClassicCut Lite Guillotine Trimmer is a well-made product that fulfills its promise."
6,"I use paper cutters primarily for origami. where getting straight and accurate cuts is CRITICAL. Unfortunately it's very hard to get them correct with this trimmer. First. the guides are relatively wide compared to other cutters. so it's hard to know where precisely to line the paper up. The other issue is that the guide in the middle of the cutter is further down on this larger size than on the smaller model. This makes is much more difficult to line paper up if you are cutting to sizes of around 6 inches or less. which I very often am (cutting 12x12 scrapbook paper to 6x6). It doesn't handle multiple sheets particularly well. I could do about 3 or 4 before I started having issues. but it's the accuracy of it that is the biggest issue for me personally. If you don't need perfect cuts though it's a good enough trimmer and certainly will do the trick for photo use and other less critical jobs."
6,"This paper trimmer looks cheap (the body is gray plastic). but is sturdy and reliable and more than meets all our small office needs. Love the grid that helps you keep the paper straight. If you need more than a few sheets at a time cut. or other features like a spring-loaded arm. you should invest in a more expensive heavy-duty trimmer. But this is more than adequate for us and a welcome addition to our office equipment. as I can't cut a straight line with scissors to save my life!"
6,"This is a plastic Guillotine from Swingline. All that plastic and light weight may make it feel a bit on the cheaper side. especially if you are used to the heavier guillotine. But. this works just as well. It comes with the usual inch and metric ruler and the alignment grid. It has a protective guardrail to protect your precious little fingers.I have used it for about 3 weeks now and it has worked well. It cuts in straight lines and the cut is neat. I really like it and it has replaced my old guillotine (which I gave back to my sister...the original owner)."
6,"The Swingline ClassicCut delivers crisp. clean cuts. It is well made and sturdy - sure to last many. many years.My only ding (and it is a small one) is that I wish there were suction cups on the bottom to secure it firmly to the table.I make my own business cards. printed on heavy-stock paper. and use the Swingline ClassicCut to cut them individual cards. The built-in guide makes that process fast and easy.I also like printing 4-6 photos on larger-sized photo paper and the Swingline enables me to cut these into perfect separate photos.I cannot cut a straight line with a pair of scissors to save my life - and thankfully I don't have to try now that I rely on my Swingline ClassicCut. Two thumbs up."
6,"When I first got it. it was so lightweight that I thought &#34;this thing can't be much more than a toy. but it surprised me.  It cuts straight and clean.  I like the way it's marked for measuring.  It says it will cut &#34;up to 10 sheets&#34; which it does.  I really don't need more than that at home anyway.  I'm used to the beast we have where I used to work.  The thing weighed a lot and it felt very substantial.  This doesn't have the weight. but it does seem to be a good product for what I need.  After I got over my first impression that it was flimsy. I find I like that it's lightweight so I can move it easily with one hand.  My son just started back to college studying art and photography.  He has already used it and is happy with it as well.  Score!"
6,"I often make oversized prints of my photographs and to save money and time I'll have my local office supply store print them on good quality stock that is often not perfectly sized to the print. I use this unit to make super-clean straight cuts. It is not a heavy duty machine but it could handle 5-6 sheets easily.Be warned though that the more sheets in a stack to cut. the greater the chance that the edges will not be precise. If you need it perfect. do one sheet at a time."
6,"This isn't the biggest. heaviest or sturdiest guillotine cutter in the world. for sure.  It's fairly small. and plastic-y.  But. it actually does a pretty great job as long as you take your time.  It's very lightweight. which is great if you need to move it around. but it's easy to make it shift around accidentally when you're using it.  But as long as you line up what you're cutting well and cut smoothly. and don't try to cut more than a half-dozen or so pages at once. you'll get a perfect. clean cut."
6,"They're push-pins. They do what you'd think that they would. There seem to be about the proper number. but I certainly haven't counted. My only gripe. and why it's 4 stars. is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic. two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright. but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except. doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them. and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container."
6,"These come in one of those standard cheap plastic containers which is always a bummer because you end up needing to put them in something else eventually.  However. the price was great for a 30 count of various sizes.  The only size lacking is the very large ones which I do have occasion to use when I'm unable to use anything but.  That or sit with a whole puncher forever and put them into a binder.  The shipping was quick and they were in pristine condition when they arrived.  I haven't as of yet had a problem with them not being durable which is big bonus so great material."
6,"These boxes empty automatically; I have no idea where they get to. Occasionally I'll notice one under a screw on a cabinet door where 'food storage' lists or whatever is clipped. And there must be dozens of them clipped. two each. to a half inch of documents that no longer require a binder but are still used occasionally. But we've been buying these for 50 years... where have they gone? One clever use is as a handle for 'little things''; you clip them on. then slide the chrome pieces off the spring steel portions and just use what is left. We've got an ancient chest in the barn with one of these clipped onto each of the tiny drawer pulls so they're easier to grip."
6,"This product may be fine enough. but the storage process clearly wasn't.  The binder clips were entwined in elaborate. deep webbing. which I thought might be some kind of strange packaging.  Nope.  As I tried to pull back the thick white sheet on the clips. there appeared an enormous spider...the kind of thing you see only in a few places in the U.S.  Never again will I buy an Acco product; I'd be too terrified of what might appear in the box.I have no idea about the product. as I obviously threw out the box. giant spider. ocean of spider-killer. and all."
6,"If the size is very important for you. check the photo of the box first. The description by Amazon lists these as 1-1/4. however the box actually lists 1-1/16.Even then. really the usable size is closer to just 1'.We needed super large clips at the office. and measured that 1-1/4 would be just perfect. however with the actual usable bit measuring in at 1'. we're having some problems making them work.Granted. they do work great. but the item description was misleading online. and the actual stated capacity is also stretching it a little.Durability is great as usual. though unusual warping may occur due to the larger size. Harder to open to the full 1' size."
6,"These are amazing! How clever that someone devised a way to bend thin strips of shiny metal in such a fashion that they can be used to clip several sheets of paper products together so they don't get lost. They don't work as well as my stapler. but those with commitment issues will find the paper clip a great alternative. They can also be bent into fun shapes when you are faced with idle time sitting at your desk. However. it seems that once they are altered from their original shape. they do not perform their intended task very well anymore. Sure glad that I purchased 1.000 of these little buggers."
6,"So. I won't.  I can. however. get excited about the value you'll get on Amazon.If you need bubble wrap for shipping at a good price. this is a good deal.Note: Most bubble wrapping will stick to your shipped product if you're sending it across state/country in 100+ degree weather. the product material is susceptible to it (glossy book cover. plastics. etc.)and the barrier between the wrapping and the outside of the shipping container is minimal in thickness.  Be aware of this and cover your product with something prior to applying the bubble wrap to ensure your product won't stick to it (i.e. a single layer of wrapping tissue around the product)"
6,"I purchased 2 of these for my recent cross-country move to protect my kitchen-wares and fragile stuff (e.g. lamps. picture frames. a porcelain owl. etc.).  I did not lose any dishes. cups. bowls. and other fragile items during the move I'm sure in part thanks to the Scotch Cushion Wrap.  The perforations 12 inches help make it easy to tear proper lengths of bubble wrap and you can easily fold or stack them back up for re-use.  I have no complaints and will probably buy again for my next move."
6,"This bubble wrap is quite a bargain. especially compared to what it costs at a local office supply store.  Even though the bubble wrap is in a box. that box is placed in a larger box for shipping...it's like Amazon is throwing in a box for free!I always buy perforated bubble wrap now - it reduces the time to it takes to wrap items.  I occasionally sell things via online auction just to make a few dollars. not as a living.  The less time I spend wrapping goods the better.As a bonus. even though the bubbles are smaller they still make a satisfying popping sound...bubble wrap isn't just for shipping things. it's for stress relief too!Buy this - free shipping + free box + made in the USA = a great value."
6,"It was important that I receive this fast because I was going to move fast. It arrived in the scheduled time frame. Quality bubble wrap. worked well for protecting my stuff during shipment... but...not much can stop UPS and the way they throw around your packages like a sport. They still managed to break some things somehow. The next time I moved I had a UPS store pack my stuff for me. paid them and everything. Bought their bubble wrap and box based on their recommendations and paid for the shipping. They STILL broke my stuff even more. including completely damaging my EVGA GTX 285. It was a huge hassle to get money out of them for their mistake. they kept trying to blame me despite the fact they were paid to pack and ship it and I had insured it. That's right! no bubble wrap can save you from UPS. but this is good quality bubble wrap."
6,"I can't get over just how 'real' these cards look. even when using a standard inkjet printer. There is NO telltale rough/perforated edge. and the matte ivory looks classier than standard white cards if you're looking for an 'executive' feel to your cards.I downloaded Avery's own 'DesignPro' program (free--and idiot-proof). which makes it ridiculously simple to design and print your cards. The best thing about this is that even though the bargain business-card company many of us use (you know which one) does a terrific job for a good price. you don't always need 200 cards and you can't always wait. For instance. if you have a new employee and a conference/tradeshow/meeting in a couple of days. it's easy to knock off a few dozen cards in an instant so he/she can do business right away.Can't recommend these highly enough."
6,"I'm actually a travel agent. and I purchased these to use in plastic luggage tags that I give to my clients.  They work just fine.  I do find that the edges look a little better than other brands that I've tried. though because of the way I use them. that's not as much of an issue for me. it certainly would be if you're actually using them as your business card.  On other brands. you will sometimes see a little 'fiber' around the card. and you don't see that with these."
6,"I've used print at home business cards before. and they always left a rough edge.  There was no way around it- you could tell you printed them at home.  I have to say however. that these 'Clean Edge' business cards are a vast improvement on the past!  To a trained eye. you can still see the edge was that of a tear-away. but they look pretty darn good!  I wouldn't be embarrassed to pass these out. as I was with the older versions."
6,"If you want to have a card for all occassions.  it's easy - just get these Business cards and you can make up as many as you need.  with whatever design you want...These cards allow me a flexibility that vista cards do not. so I can change them subtly if I need to.  They also print easily and don't smudge.  and break apart cleanly.  The final product looks completely professional.That being said.  if you need 500 identical cards.  I would go to a professional printer.  But if you only need small amounts and things change as you go.  then these are a terrific option.  Happy to use them and would buy again."
6,"These are great for small business owners like myself who do their own business cards. rather than paying out for someone else to do them.  As long as you have a good printer. they work very well.  The only negative I could say about them is that you have to print one sheet at a time.  You can't stack 2 or more sheets in your paper tray and tell your design software to print multiples.  If you do. you'll ruin at least one sheet of cards.  It's a bit inconvenient to have to load a sheet. click print. wait.  Load a sheet. click print. wait.  Other than that. I have no complaints."
6,"Need new business cards fast? Don't want to pay for rush printing and shipping? Then these cards could just be what you need.I had no problems setting up the cards to print. Of course. as always. there are a couple of things you should keep in mind:1.) Do not tear the cards apart when you are done. 'Snap' them apart by bending them toward you.2.) Place one sheet in your printer at a time.Yes. these tips are printed right there in the instructions. But looking through the 1 and 2 Star reviews on Amazon. I think a few people missed those helpful tidbits before they wasted paper and ink.Of course. I didn't need the whole 80 for my emergency card run. Now my son gets some nifty new Math Facts flash cards!"
6,"Avery Clean Edge Business Cards - #28878These business card blanks are designed specifically for use with an ink jet printer. Each sheet contains ten standard size 2' x 3.5' cards - eight sheets to a package (80 cards total). The sheets can be printed on both sides if required. The paper stock is a nice. heavy weight and the individual cards feel appropriately thick with a good solid feel. Avery's Clean Edge feature allows the finished cards to literally 'snap' apart by bending the sheets backward. The resulting cards have no perforations and the edges are totally clean - impossible to tell your own printed cards from ones that are professionally prepared.Avery has Word templates available for download or by going to [...] it is possible to design your cards with the help of their Avery Design site. I prefer to design my own cards with graphics apps. but having this service available as a no-cost option will be helpful to some.This is an excellent quality product - highly recommended."
6,"There really isn't anything very complicated about hand made business cards. I've never found a paper that gives the cards the same look as a professionally printed card. and this paper is no different. (I do give room for the possibility that the look of the cards is more the fault of my printer or my design ability.) The snap-break does give the cards a cleaner look than a perforated card would give. but in the end. they still look like something you printed at home from your computer. The cards look great and the instructions are simple. but if I'm looking for new business cards. I'm going to go one of two ways. Either I'm going to order them from a professional company or I'm going to make them at home with a cheaper paper. With so many online companies offering professional cards at such low prices. I wonder if there is any real market for products like this."
6,"I make handcrafted pens from exotic woods and sell them at craft shows. I have a card made up for each kind of wood that I use and give it with the pen when I sell them. I only have 27 different flavors of woods and 10 different styles of pens. each with its own care card. Add to that my own card and that makes a lot of cards to be printing and cutting!I've been doing the cards the hard way and printing them on card stock and then cutting them out. With these its so much easier! The only thing about them is that sometimes they dont separate clean. Sometimes the cards don't come apart clean and it pulls up a little feather of paper on the edge ruining that card. That's why I only gave them four stars. Now if I can get them in different colors I'll never use card stock for them again!"
6,"The best way to go with these business cards is to download the free Avery Design Pro software. Using this program. one can create a wide variety of business cards to satisfy virtually anyone.These cards do have a matte finish which is more conservative in appearance than the glossy or semi-glossy stock that is also available from Avery. They take color nicely and look very professional with their smooth edge.The cards break loose easily and dry quickly. It is usually wise to let them sit for a few minutes before stacking them.I am very pleased with the business cards that have been produced from this product and can recommend them to anyone wanting to exercise creativity in the design of their business cards."
6,"These blank cards work hand-in-glove with design templates that you download for free from Avery's website.  Those templates are easy to use and intuitive.  They do not allow as many tweaks as high-end design programs. but then there is no steep learning curve either.  Perfectly sufficient to produce a small run of business cards in a pinch.The matte paper is much better than glossy for business cards.  I compared them by printing on both. and the matte paper helped hide small imperfections of imported graphics. while the glossy clearly exposed them.The sheets are very well produced. and after you break them into cards. the edges are surprisingly smooth.This is a good product that does the job as advertised!"
6,"Avery wasn't kidding when they named these business cards Clean Edge.  They really break off with clean edges and it's so easy. too. The quality of the paper is superb and I printed with an ordinary inkjet printer and there were no smears or streaks. The sheet will tell you how to load in the paper and how to break off the cards.  They also include instructions on how to download free software from Avery and the website also has a lot of templates for business cards and other projects.  Avery is really awesome for business and creative needs!"
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"If you have a good printer. the sheets are great for making business cards and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the cards pop out. Unfortunately. my printer does not detect the sheets as feed and tends to do funky things. so it is recommended to do a lot of tests and planning before printing.I also had an issue with Staples selling a defective product (the paper was rough and looked used) and Avery customer service was very responsive. They sent another pack over. which worked fine. and I bought a huge pack from Amazon because I loved it so much!"
7,"I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50. 75. and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course. it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility. which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather. but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking. but they're not kink-proof. either. nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others. but the latter were fairly stiff. so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase."
7,"This is one tough hose and it is thick and stiff.The connections are strong and the hose is industrial strength.I bought this to use with my pressure washer because it is 8 ply and 3/4 inch wide.My old hose was just rubber and it was flexing and twisting and there is no way this hose is going to do that.The hose is warrantied for life and unless there is a problem with a leak i don't think i will ever need to use it.The local big box stores do not sell a 3/4 50 foot hose and my pressure washer will not operate with anything longer than 50 feet.The price and delivery were great and Amazon is the best around if there is ever a concern."
7,"It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but don't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle. This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice. snappy. feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic. I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect."
7,"This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design. sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern. it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g.. it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out. which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one. you'll like it."
7,"After hearing so much about this unit. and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood. I decided to give it a try. even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler.I now know why so many  people like it.  It is very effective in watering the lawn. without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation. and not  affected by wind as much). and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.Adjusting the spray diameter is easy. and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.Inspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated. and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!"
7,"The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had. and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year. but very long. hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty. but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose."
7,"I read all the positive reviews and was excited about it. Now im excited to replace it with a plastic rain bird sprinklerPros: Solid build. strong material construction. quick performer. very easy to adjust the spray pattern.Cons: It does not have a gasket on the bottom thread so youll need to add some plumber's tape to get a solid seal. It has some overspray that goes beyond the spray pattern which is disappointing if you wanna keep from wasting water. Expensive! At this price. I could have purchased two plastic Rain Bird sprinklers.Other: I recently tested three different impact sprinklers (on video) and so far the best seems to be the plastic rain bird. youll see my video review from youtube this one and the plastic one if you view the plastic one."
7,"I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet. but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further. but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly. and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now. i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation."
7,"I used to use a really primitive manual edger that I inherited from my father. Blistered hands and time wasted. I decided there had to be a better way and this is surely it.Edging is one of those necessary evils if you want a great looking house. I don't edge every time I mow. Usually I do it every other time. The first time out after a long winter. edging usually takes a little longer. After that. edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower."
7,"The Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog 2-1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger is so easy to use and does a great job of edging my lawn. I purchased this edger because I became so tired of trying to edge my lawn with a string trimmer. The string trimmer did a choppy job. but the B&D edger makes a nice and neat edge on my lawn. Before this purchase I dreaded the job. The fact that this edger can also make trenches is a big plus. I am a female senior citizen and care for my lawn myself. Anything that makes that job easier (like this edger) deserves five stars. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs an edger that is easy to use and does a good job."
7,"I love this edger!  I have been using it for almost 2 years. and it is still going strong.  It has plenty of power. yet is easy to maneuver.I get a beautiful. straight edge along my sidewalk from using this tool.  It is so easy to guide in a straight line.  I also use it to keep a trench space between my grass and my landscaped areas. which has worked much better than a trimmer.We had a gas powered edger before this one. but it was too heavy for me.  I actually enjoy yard work. but rarely did it because the tools we had were difficult for me to manage.  Now that I have this electric edger. which is significantly lighter without the gas tank. as well as a manual mower. I do most of the yard work. and love it!"
7,"If you need an edger. and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger. this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most. and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light. too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer. or not edging your lawn at all. you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger."
7,"This is the direct replacement part for the B&D; Grass Hog model NST2018.  I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I don't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one.  This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change.  The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I didn't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself.  This is a good buy and works well.  I recommend it to you!"
7,"So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go. I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker. This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute. The spools last longer than expected. But all good things come to an end and you don't want to be half way through the yard when you find yourself strung out.Black & Decker CMM1200 19-Inch 24-Volt Cordless Electric Mulching Lawn Mower"
7,"I easily get two years out of a spool of this string while cutting both grass and weeds on my 18v trimmer.  It cuts clean and level and does not shred even on the harder stuff.  On rare occasions you may just break a little of the end off but that just tears away cleanly on your next trim. so no cutting of the line is necessary.  Yes. it is cheaper to just buy the line and wind it yourself. but for roughly $4 and some change it is hardly worth your time and effort."
7,"For years. I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out. the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding. the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool. but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you. disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)"
7,"I made the mistake of taking the spool that came with my B & D LST136 cordless trimmer and experienced what it would be like if I tried to save money by buying cord in bulk and winding my own spools.  I painstakingly wound the cord from left to right and from right to left as instructed in the manual.  I dropped it a few times and had to begin again.  I did it right because the cord does advance automatically in my trimmer. but I have to say I am glad I purchased spools that are already wound.  When I have to replace the spool that came with the trimmer. I will be careful to hold the cord tightly against the spool!"
7,"It was a little smaller than I expected. but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something. may that would be a different story. but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well."
7,"I recently received this product and just put it out yesterday.  It seems to be working wonderfully and there was a pile of dead insects this morning to show for it!!  I will post again if I have any compaints...but don't really anticipate any.  12/30/08  I now have a complaint!  The light in this unit was faulty.  It still comes on but the light is yellow and not white like it's suppose to be and it doesn't attrack the insects now. The light went out about 2 months ago so it wasn't but maybe 4 months old. 7/27/09 I ordered a replacement bulb on March 22. 2009 to get ready for the mosquito season...today is 7/27/09 and that bulb burned out 2 days ago! 4 month life span...AMAZING!  Needless to say...I WON'T be replacing it again at a cost of $21.99.....and will be looking for another bulb that will work in this unit."
7,"Only draw back I could come up with is my girlfriend is convinced the light is attracting more bugs from the neighborhood. lol.  We have a pool and a pond. along with wetlands on our property. so we simply have a lot of bugs.  This thing is working constantly while it is on.  The zapping can get quite loud. but it is doing its job.  We have it set up about 20 feet from out deck. and 15 from the pool.  You don't want it closer. as it will bring bugs around.  They are attracted to it...which is exactly what you want! Just not right next to you.  Cord it short. so you will need a heavy duty extension cord.  I hung mine on  a trellis. but if you don't have something to hang it from. you may need a sturdy stand...this things is pretty massive. and has some weight to it."
7,"Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend."
7,"....to really tell if it works as we are short of mosquitos this year and I have not attached the bait that comes with it to attract what there are.  I have had several of these in the past and they proved effective and this should be the same.  Bulb cost is minimal thought limits advertised effectiveness to a half acre.  I'm not sure how they figured that out but our deck is 20 feet from a small pond that hatches these guys and this little machine should be OK to zap 'em."
7,"This light is pretty worthless.  It kills lots of moths and other non-biting bugs but didn't put a dent in the mosquito or fly population.  I got this as an alternative to my unreliable SkeeterVac but it does not work and is equally unreliable.  The bulbs blew after 1 season.  Replacement bulbs are $40 each plus shipping.  It takes 2.  That is $90 for 2 bulbs and I only paid $80 for the whole unit.  Thanks but no thanks.Unfortunately. the only thing I've found that actually catches mosquitoes is the propane powered devices.  They are all unreliable too.  Skip the zappers and traps and use deet."
7,"SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job. but didn't last that long. and was expensive to replace. The pesky 'flies' go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract 'non pesky' bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away. so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside. and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy. but that is how I feel :)"
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
7,"We just received this unit this week. and can already note an improvement in our yard. We have used dunks for some water gardens we have. and have been impressed with the Flowtron unit thus far. A lot of dead mosquitoes every morning. We hook it up to an outdoor timer and run the unit automatically from dusk to dawn.  It will take about three weeks for all the eggs to hatch and mature then we'll see a great reduction in mosquitoes.It's been a very wet in North Texas and we have a bumper crop this year. Am going to explore mixing up some hot pepper and garlic--recipes are available online as a barrier. We hope a combination on factors can help rid us of a heavy mosquito population. Have not noticed any beneficial insects on or under the grids.We compared brands and sizes and selected this one due to reviews of others on Amazon. Recommend the bigger wattage for better attraction of flying insects--with mosquitoes being our main target."
7,"We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener."
7,"At first I didn't like this Corona pruner because it didn't seem to cut well.  Then I realized the source of the problem was me.  I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles. so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position. but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference. but there it is.  So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide. and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces."
7,"the first thing that happened was that the two end caps fell off. where? i don't know. but i hope to find them. i really think this is a 1 inch capacity lopper. in my experience there is no way this can cut 2 inches of wood. what kind of wood can it cut 2 inches of? yes it is a great tool but for 1 inch branches or less. i am happy that i bought it but it is for light duty and it does a great job of light duty work. i have been outside clearing a lot of branches and brush and i cannot ever see this cutting 2 inches of anything."
7,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally. my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this. and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands. it hasn't stuck or jammed. and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right. other reviewers. :)"
7,"I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons. but with the help of another person and two long poles. we did it.)  I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away. it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled. before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing. what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit. but I don't want to kill songbirds. certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away. not kill them."
7,"We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it. because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is. the two hand-grips are each curved to the side. giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to 'steer' the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands. it was very awkward to 'steer' the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since."
7,"This is a handy tool for cultivating small areas. but it is not appropriate for anything more than a medium sized flowerbed.  The handles work well to gain leverage. but you will feel it in your muscles if you  attempt to do too large an area!The fact that it isn't powered lets  you get into areas you wouldn't want to go with even the smallest of  tillers. and it does a great job of breaking up the ground to a depth of a  couple of inches. which is perfect for flowers.For larger projects. use  a mini-tiller. and use this tool for the detail work and the smaller beds.  Both tools are a good combination to have at your disposal."
7,"Currently I hate this thing.  I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass. but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block."
7,"It's a classic all right. but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well. you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag. far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing. however. is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut."
7,"I am a avid gardener. I take care of the flowers and my husband takes care of the lawn.  We have had too many cases of lawmmower blight;by definition - the weed wacker or lawn mower cuts down my flowers and bushes.  After too many cases of lawnmower blight. I bought this little mower for trimming near my flower beds that are naturalized (lawnmower blight does not happen at mulched beds).This is a great tool!  Very sharp and easy to push. perfect for what I need it for.  At first my husband was slightly insulted by and for the reason of this pruchase. he even snickered when it came out of the box. but when he tried it he loved it and is now using it to trim by our driveway as is cuts lower than our 'big' mower.Highly recommend for very small lawns and trimming. remember it is 14 inches wide.I JUST LOVE IT1"
7,"This is my second germination set I've ordered in the last two weeks.  This one is even flimsier than the other one by Hydrofarms.  However. the concept works:  place peat pots of seeds in a warm. humid environment and seeds will sprout.  I have mine on a heating pad under a grow lamp.  The peat pots only expanded to just under an inch.An aluminum pan with a clear lid would work just as well. as the metal would distribute the heat better.  I found the lid popped off easily so I check on it several times a day.  I have beans and turnips growing in my peat pots.With care I intend to reuse the pan and lid for multiple uses.  For new gardeners this is an effective way to grow seeds.  I could also place peat pots in sealed plastic bags for cheaper. though. I will report back in a week when the first seeds sprout."
7,"I read the negative reviews and bought the trap anyway because I wanted a humane trap; just couldn't bring myself to kill the one mouse that seemed to have snuck into my house.  I posted a picture; the trap is smaller than a dollar bill.  I found that I was 'waiting up' and checking the mousetrap every half hour. because any mouse that it caught would certainly die rather quickly in there.  A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn't release the catch within minutes of a trap.  I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is. it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes."
7,"Having read reviews of several different live traps. had no idea which was best.  So. bought about 4 different ones.  THIS ONE WORKED.  Put them all out with peanut butter and had no sign of any activity except this one.  Didn't know how many mice we had. but caught three with this one and zero with the others and no escapes. it seems. from the others.  They were all put in the same general area.  This one worked. was easy to set. easy to bait and easy to release the mouse."
7,"I've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow &#34;flowers&#34; come out too easily and get lost.  This resulted in wasps. bees. etc being able to drink the liquid.  I had used it a few years and am supposing they aren't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far.  Otherwise. great feeder with large capacity.  It is very heavy. so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb."
7,"I don't have any problems with this and neither do the birds. We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives. they really don't care that the water isn't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.Anyway. I just unscrew it from the cap when I want to clean and fill it. then empty any remaining solution down the drain in the yard and wash it off with the hose before taking it indoors (sugar water really attracts dirt in a carpet. ask me how I know).I have not found it difficult to clean. Once refilled I take it out again. still upside down. and then turn it over before anything significant can leak out. Then just screw it back in to the cap."
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean. This feeder is way too large for my liking. you need a lot (tons!) of sugar syrup to fill it up. It also took a week for my hummingbirds to go near this feeder and even now it's their second choice to my other smaller feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. And I don't think they are very attracted to this feeder due to its flat yellow flowers. instead of the pretty raised ones you get on other feeders."
7,"Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however. there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well."
7,"These did not fit my feeder. but I super-glued them in place. The 'basket' part also falls off of the 'stem' part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue. so if you try this work-around. be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry. too.I like feeding bees. and they have their own plate of sugar water. but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky. although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today. a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it. bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems. I guess!"
7,"My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Excellent packaging!Quality of Gauge was evident -- solid brass fittings. clear 0-200 lb. increments and metric scale (atmospheres).A special Flat Rubber Washer (included) prevents leaks and helps keep water out of the housing. BE SURE the flat rubber washer is in place and fitting is tight to the spigot or manifold before water is turned on !! Don't dare lose that Flat Washer. 'cause a regular Hose Washer won't work !!IF you have installed the Flat Washer and tightened the Fitting properly before turning on the water -- and you see water inside the gauge. turn it off and SEND IT BACK as defective. Amazon's Returns Policy is the best in the on-line retail business. so it's a hassle-free deal to get an exchange or refund.Good Luck !!"
7,"Attaches to any regular outside spicket or your washing machine line.  Seems to read ok. but I'm not 100% sure because I do not have anything to compare it too.  I think it would be beneficial to have a professional with professional tools measure the pressure as well to ensure the most accurate reading.The one negative I have is that the gauge fills up with water under the glass.  I'm not sure if mine is defective or if they are all that way. but I would think the water should not seep in like that."
7,"I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price. This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However. after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.Overall. I am pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review"
7,"I purchased three of these via Amazon (free delivery) for $8 each and back for more. Great value! I use them in combination with a 4 way connector set and adjustable sprinklers to water each of my raised garden beds with just one quick turn of the hose. Not only are they a much better quality than the sets supposedly created to do the same thing but the price is competitive too. Just the right size to daisy chain sprinklers and reduces the time required to tend the garden...perfect for raised garden beds where regular sprinkler system might be over-kill.UPDATE - I noticed many people complaining over quality...for the record I received the Black hose remnants as pictured. From the sound of it. there are various colors and quality issues. The black ones are very good quality with brass fittings."
7,"This is a short piece of hose.  It may not be the colour shown. so don't buy it if you're using it for decorative purposes.  If you want it to function. it will.Yes. it has a plastic washer instead of rubber.  If you would happen to have a leaking problem. just add some teflon tape (which you should be doing to all your pressurized hose joints anyway as a precautionary measure) - it only costs a few cents a roll.As this is the cheapest such item to serve its purpose. it gets my recommendation.[Mine is red and green. apparently for Christmas]."
7,"I've had the same brush for 4 years now. This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy. doesn't heat up. and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head. you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18' handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said. it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles."
7,"Before. when I went to buy a new brush I would always get the cheapies; I thought they were all the same. except some came in plastic while others came in wood or aluminum. I was wrong. You do get what you pay for when buying a grill brush. so buy this one! The bristles are stiff enough to clean up all the grit. yet soft enough to not damage your grate. The brush feels nice and sturdy. it feels well built. Also. this brush has a handy scraper on the end which is extremely handy with the really tough crusties (on your GRILL silly)."
7,"Ive had this same grill for about 8 years now and its as nice now as the day I got it. Its big enough to cook pretty much whatever you need to cook on it. of course if you have a lot to cook it may take a little longer. Ive always had everything cook very evenly with more than sufficient burn time with coals. This grill is also small enough that you can take it with you for camping or going on your boat for a bbq on the beach (I just use a bungy cord to secure the lid) . If I need to rid of the coals I just put water on them turn the grill upside down and cover the coals in dirt. if the grill is still hot ill throw some more water on it then wipe it down and off we go..This grill isnt heavy so you can easily dump out the ashes in your trash can or where ever with minimal effort. Very great grill for the price and perfect for pretty much anyone!"
7,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also. there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us. it&#8217;s easy to assemble. it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go."
7,"You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people."
7,"We have a similar model One Touch Premium home (Germany) and the quality of Weber pays off. I brought the old chinese bbq to trash today ;-).The Weber is very solid build and comes ready to go with drop pans and charcoal holders (wires). Bought a chimney from Weber since the reviews were so good. Tried direct and indirect. keep on training.Will not to back to chinese quality again.Since we live in Northern Germany usage of this bbq is limited to summer time. completed with a Q200 grill."
7,"Our gas grill finally rusted out after 15 years. I was ready to spend $700 on the 320 but started asking myself why? Grilling outside is for leisure. take your time. relax and enjoy the flavor. So I opted for this Weber One Touch Gold - what I have been missing all these years!This grill is so easy to use. I didn't get the chimney starter. I just place some newspapers under the charcoal and it works just fine. I am usually grilling in about 15 - 20 minutes. The ash collector is fantastic. the ashes don't blow around and it makes it easy to remove the leftover ashes. I got blue. it really looks great. The little hook inside the lid makes it easy to set it aside so you have both hands.This is going to be a great summer - now if we could just get some sun here in the NW!"
7,"I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time. finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time. we cooked a lot of meat. pepper. corn and etc. it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it. it's gonna get a lot more use this summer."
7,"This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years."
7,"I purchased this grill. but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter. it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill. so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned."
7,"This is the best charcoal grill I have ever owned. I have cooked ribs at 225-250 and been able to control the fire easily. I used the 2-2-1 method on a rack of baby backs and never had to think about adding charcoal over 5 hours. By using the vents you can get wood chips to smolder for an hour and not flare up and burn away in minutes.  The ash pan holds at least three cooks worth of ashes and does not leak.  I feel comfortable cooking on my wooden deck because of the ash pan. The only addition i would make is the Craycort cast iron grate."
7,"We had a gas grill for years but opted to go back to a charcoal grill.  This Weber grill made our decision easy.  Outstanding medium size grill for the two of us grilling several items and works well for 4 or more depending on what you need to prepare on the grill.  Suggest using the Weber Rapidfire Chiminey for starting your briquets...it's great and makes your job not only easier but the food taste better without the use of starter fluid.  Great grill....great name behind it!!"
7,"After our gas grill had to be retired. we decided to get a charcoal grill.  Weber has a reputation for having a solid product that will last for many years. and I have no doubt that we'll be using this for a long time.  But the legs seem to be made out of somewhat cheaper material than what we had when I was younger. Think I'll be getting the cover to protect it over the winter.This particular model doesn't have the one-touch ash catcher and after using this a few times. I'm kind of sorry we didn't go with that particular model.One person can put it together without help. athough it can be a struggle for a bit.Grilling?  Well that's exactly like you'd expect although I miss having a grated shelf to keep some items a little further from the charcoal.  That just requires a difference in how you mound the briskets."
7,"I love this Weber One Touch Silver kettle. Seeing the kettles my relatives have. but made years earlier. i am pleased that years later. it still seems to be made with high quality steel. a good enamel and tight engineering. The handles have gone from wood to a resin. but they work well. Grilling or smoking. this unit has proven itself worth the money.I wrestled between buying the Silver or the Gold model. but what swayed me was that on Weber's site. the Silver shows 'Made in USA' while the Gold does not. The reviewers for the Gold. here on Amazon. state that the box says 'Assembled in USA'. or something like that. The Weber site has no mention of any of it. I decided to avoid the issues that some with the Gold were reporting and I went with the Silver. It is very solid and I am glad I did."
7,"This grill has one major flaw.....surprised it is still being sold due to product liability. The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces...like your deck. your pine straw. or house. For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system. If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires. you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill. I love the way a Weber cooks. but this model is needlessly risky.  And if you have one of these grills.  take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill. A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes. This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly.....it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task. If you value the property you live in. or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence. avoid this flame thrower."
7,"I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens. cabbage. bread. and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking. use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate."
7,"I've had the 18.5 Weber kettle for about 5 years and have been very happy with it. However. anyone shopping for a grill should consider the full-size. 22.5 grill.We bought the 18.5 because our family is small and I figured this would be plenty big enough. What I didn't consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking. The 18.5 just doesn't have the space. even for a small family. If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people. the 18.5 will serve fine but you won't have much versatility.Now that I've 'grown' as a griller. I wish I had the One-touch Platinum. This model gives extra space. an ash catcher. temp gauge. sliding lid and 2 side tables. However. my 18.5 is still going strong after 5 years of steady use and sitting in the elements. Kinda difficult to justify the new grill when the old one is still in great shape."
7,"I got this in addition to my Weber Genesis Platinum Grill. I love my Charcoal grill especially for those times when I want Steak. Burgers. Chicken. BBQ Chicken. for a great authentic taste. It heats quickly (Weber Chimney) about 20 minutes. It is easy to assemble. very sturdy and quite stable. Some reviewers noted they could not move with hot coals and food as it only has one handle. You should never move a hot grill of any kind. It should be used in a safe place away from combustable materials. The Weber Silver Kettle Grill is terrific and I use it almost regularly and in combination with my gas grill for a complete cooking experience outdoors. (I also have a smoker for the real low and slow cooking). The 18 1/2 inch cooking surface is excellent. and 2 zone and 3 zone is possible by adjusting the number of coals used and position. I did 2 zone cooking and all worked extremely well."
7,"I caught over 18 rabbits. 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort."
7,"I caught five raccoons in six days of having the trap set. Sometimes the raccoon turns the trap over after he is trapped but it doesn't open. The carrying handle and shield came off with the second raccoon. I used a needle-nose pliers to wrap the shield flange around the wires of the trap and now it stays on securely. I also used the pliers to tighten the wires that hold the carrying handle on. Subsonic .22 caliber bullets can humanely eliminate the raccoon without a lot of noise. Marshmallows make good bait. Something fishy will catch raccoons but it can also catch cats and opossums. which I am not trying to reduce."
7,"Using peanut butter and marshmallows in a papercup as bait I have trapped and transported 4 out of a family of 5 raccoon away from my Koi pond.  I take them 8 miles away and release them near a small river.  Only one left is one of the teenagers. I'll probably get them next week.  If I had hired a &#34;critter getter&#34; to trap them. they would have killed them which I didn't want.Easy to set. easy to pick up without exposing yourself to the animal inside.  I like the way it opens. I cover the trap with a towel so they can't see me and just pop the door up.  The minute they see the opening. they are gone.If you are going to transport them remember that it is against the law in some areas.  Also recommend that you put some wood underneath the cage in your car to protect your interior.  Anything they can reach they will try to use to claw their way out."
7,"We bought this ~1 week ago and we've caught 2 groundhogs thus far. We used strawberries for ours. We grated some strawberry on the cage. then tossed one in the back of the cage. We set it next to their burrow. then literally waited 1-2 days each.Some suggestions: Make sure to place the cage so you can check it from afar. We didn't know we caught one for a good portion of the day. Luckily it was a cooler day. so he/she was ok. Also make sure to weight the cage a bit. bc sometimes a moving cage will spook them back out of it. Had no problems with opening the door afterwards. but make sure to open it away from you because they nearly fly out of it!"
7,"I put my bait (peanut butter) on the top of the entrance box so it gets between these and the lid. Attracts great and the mice can't get to it so the same bait works for months.No setting required. you don't even really need bait if well placed. I keep these under garage shelving. under stairs. in the floor of the pantry. etc. and just let them sit until successful.There is another model with a clear lid. not needed and these don't have plastic to break. An unadvertised benefit is that these have a 'built in alarm' of the catch. The mouse (or mice) will push around on the one way ramp which make a metallic tapping sound to alert you of their presence in the trap.If you want to release live. thats great. but if you want to dispose of the mice. just take the trap and set it in the sun for a bit and the mice will expire fairly quickly."
7,"We purchased this mouse catcher last year when we were suddenly inundated with winter lodgers in the basement.  At first. this trap did a fine job. but then it just petered out on us and stopped working.With items like this it is hard to say where the fault lies. so we are giving it Three Stars.  We had better luck though with the Woodstream Havahart Mouse Trap.Three Stars.  Leaves mice sweaty but ready to live outside again.  For us the trap stopped trapping after a couple of months."
7,"This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap. you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out. I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are 'leghold. steel-jawed traps'.  I will be going to court soon..."
7,"They are soooo much easier and not near as scary as the old ones.  I don't have to worry about losing my fingers.  I put peanut butter way in the back on the rod instead of where they say to put it. and I catch them every time.I do catch some mice that are small enough to not be harmed. but at least I get them.  And eventually they are not so lucky.  It's so easy to bait and so easy to catch them. Even my kid can do it without harm to her."
7,"This trap can actually catch mice. but if they aren't small. will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat. who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap. then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as 'starting fluid' in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care."
7,"This is a refill package only and requires you have already purchased the Victor Flea Trap. Our experience with the flea trap has been very good and we have noticed the trap catches anything that happens to stray on its surface.The refills install easily and quickly. We have had to install a new bulb in the trap but that was also easily done. We leave the trap behind a sofa in the den and have noticed a steady decrease in trapped fleas as we've used it.This is a good supplement to flea control and can be safely used with pets."
7,"I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap. There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs. As a result. the flea trap is of no use to me. These refills are of no use to me as well  and that is why I can give only one star. They cost only $5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item. I plan to offer the flea trap and the refills on the local freecycle website in case there is someone who has a flea problem and wants to try this option."
7,"Not for the faint hearted but a great arm exercise. This thing does pull up lots of dead grasses. Had this for more than 18mths now and it is one of the better tools. But with 5000 sq ft lawn. this is not a long term solution. The metal teeth will bend inwards if you use it forcefully enough; especially when lawn is wet. Not a big deal but can be frustrating each time you try to straighten it back. I'll continue to use this tool for small areas. For whole yard maintenance. I've upgraded to an electrical detatcher. [Greenworks 27022 14-Inch 10 Amp Electric Dethatcher - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTQOPVBA281X/ref=cm_cr_ryp_cmt?ie=UTF8&channel=ryp]"
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
7,"I initially purchased one for use with a rain bird plastic impact rotor sprinkler. I put an 18&#34; extension from the metal ring to the rotor. Works awesome! I have since bought three more and use one of those with another rotor. and the other two for shrub style bubblers/sprayers for my plants in the the mulch beds. One negative which isn't a huge issue for me is that if you leave water sit in it. there will be rusty water. I always disconnect the hose each time and pour out any excess water so it's not an issue. but I can see that if I didn't do that with time it could rust through or clog your sprinkler head possibly."
7,"I am a working Certified Arborist. ISA.  THIS is the best tool out there for pruning. no debate possible.  I use this pruner daily.  Fiskars has the BEST customer support. as well.  Nobody else comes close.  They have sent me replacement parts for everything on this unit. as I needed them.  They have even sent me two brand new units that sit unopened in my work shed. when I simply requested new cutting heads for two units.  They sent me new heads. as well.  They have NEVER charged me one penny for replacement parts or the two. new units. I strongly recommend this tool.  Again. you cannot do better."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
7,"This pruning stick works like a charm. Pull down on the handle or the end ball and voila. cuts through 1+' branches with relative ease.Safety is the name of the game.Thorns and prickles gone.You've got 62' distance between you and some pain. Lower levels on the ladder.This is a must have for anyone having to prune any brush of height or thorns..I have had mine for about 5yrs and it is still in excellent shape.Seems like the cutting mechanism should last a long long time.The pivoting head is very useful as well."
7,"I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!!It was worth a try. but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush. I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.  :>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application."
7,"The first one I owned my teenage son tried using it on a limb that was too big and applied too much pressure which caused it to break. As far as I am concerned it was not the companies fault that this unit was abused. I keep it now for spare parts.I am very impressed with the second one I bought. It has paid for it's self many times over and has never given me any problems when it is used properly.I am disabled with arthritis. I do not like heights. This unit is very easy to use and as it stands now I should get many more years of use from mine."
7,"No more getting down on my hands and knees to cut grass that the mower can't reach. I use this to cut grass around my mailbox post. the street lamp post on my property. the big metal box the electric company uses to feed me from its underground cable. the post the cable company uses as my feed point and anywhere else that grass needs cutting which the mower can't handle.These shears are lightweight. are easy to use. cut the grass cleanly and. best of all. they let me stand up while using them. They do not require a battery. power cord. string or anything else besides a hand. Very handy. very useful and very good."
7,"I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly.  I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.8-21-13:  I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house.  However. I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand.  They are just too large for me.  I think the swiveling handle is the culprit.  I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks.  They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands."
7,"This the next best thing to having a full size lopper in the palm of your hand. It's very strong with a power gear mechanism that makes cutting painless.  Because of the power gear action. the trigger handle rotates. softening the blow when the sheers get through the branch.  With traditional sheers. the snapping action can be painful after an hour or two of heavy duty pruning.These are heavy pruners. the grip is very comfortable.  I've only had these for two years. but it's going strong.  I wouldn't recommend it for professional u because of the exposed coil spring which is likely get clogged or damaged under heavy abuse. but it's great for the home owner.This performs the job of countless other cutting implements (small sheers to a medium duty lopper).  It's not a delicate cutter. but until recently. I was using it to deadhead my flowers with good results."
7,"I have been doing yard work for 40 years. so I am no 'backyard rookie'.  This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it. The 'PowerGear' fell off and couldn't be reattached firmly to the pruner. I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say. everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product. Poor products deserve bad reviews. both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered. Amazon expects no less.I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit. That said. I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly."
7,"I cut down two very dead shrubs today using these and was very impressed with these lightweight loppers.  I didn't think I'd get the heavier two-inch branches cut because these loppers are so light. but with the right grip the gear holds the wood down and cuts the branch cleanly in half with little effort.  I'm not the strongest person out there and I'm certainly no Hercules. but these loppers made the trim job for me fairly easy.Although these may be harder to use in dense shrub because you need a wide opening for these to work effectively. once you have a grip on the wood the cutting is easy.  And. since they are somewhat long. you can also reach up rather high.  Overall. a very well-engineered set.They are attractive on top of it. and look impressive in my tool corner."
7,"There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes. it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper."
7,"This tool makes unpleasant pruning tasks much more pleasant and the ease of cutting makes the work a lot more pleasant!  (If you can bear to think of it that way!)  It really takes the effort out of cutting thick branches.  I carry this lopper along with my smaller pruner--and I don't struggle trying to use the pruner on bush that's too thick for it.  Makes the whole pruning job go faster.I use this on our numerous rose bushes. too.  The length comes in real handy when I'm trying to avoid the thorns.In our neck-of-the-woods. we'll be pruning our roses in mid-February.  So now is not too early to start thinking about Spring-time gardening chores."
7,"These do everything the company says.  I was surprised at how easy larger limbs were to cut compared to my old loppers.  My wife tried these and was really pleased at how easy it was to cut limbs.  (Hint. Hint. guys)  Let me say I would not have tried to cut some of the big limbs with my old loppers (now gone to lopper heaven).  If the jaws of these loppers fit around a limb they will cut it and so can you.  Only once did I have a problem opening them (handles) wide enough to fit a limb inside a shrub. it was a big one.  Most of the time I could find an angle to reach through with and cut inside limbs with no problem.  I would recommend these to anyone who like me enjoys easy work.  At 66 years old and surviveing throat cancer surgery I need that too."
7,"I purchased this at Home Depot.  It can cut 2' or even 2.5' branches with relative ease.  But there is one issue.  The cutting blade broke at some point.  I didn't notice it until I had problems getting the cut to go all the way through.  However. I went to the Fiskars website [...] and found out the live chat button and explained the issue to the customer rep.  She sent a new one out that day and I received it in 3 business days.  Installing the new blade was very easy and it worked just great.Over all. this lopper is a joy to use.  The movement is smooth and the cuts are clean.I wonder if Amazon will ever sell the replacement blade. though."
7,"Fiskars has given me great service over the years. so while I didnt used to have brand loyalty to any particular lawn tool maker. I now buy their products when available.  They're all well made and work well. this is no exception.  The gear drive is smooth and powerful. and as you might expect from a company with its roots in expensive scissors the blades are exceptional and dont need frequent sharpening.  Make sure to spritz a little wd-40 or other light lube on this and any tool with moving parts before using. it'll make them last longer. work better and prevent rust."
7,"I bought these a year ago but hadn't used them much.  I just began using them this spring and loved them - would have given them five stars until today.  Ironically I just ordered another pair yesterday because they are so easy to use - lightweight and sharp.But today the orange clamp that keeps them closed when not in use no longer does its job and they stay open all the time which makes them bulkier to carry as they are much less compact with both blades and handles splaying out.  That's the reason for only 3 stars. After today's malfunction I wouldn't order them again.  Plus the price has gone up in a year from $8.68 to $11.79. They are VERY useful - I just wish they were sturdier."
7,"I've had several of these from various manufacturers. I can't add a lot to the other reviews except to say that(1) they are very capable and surgically precise for pruning. They can handle quite large cross-sections as long as the material is not woody or hard. For example. they're perfect for pruning back conifers to the next junction. even 1/4 in. dia. so long as the material is 'softish'. and(2) Do not put them away in your pocket or tray or tool shelf without putting the 'sheath' on the tip. because these are a very sharp and finely pointed weapon when locked closed. You can get a bad wound when you sit down. or crouch. or bend over if these are in a pocket unprotected.If you lose the little protective tip. use a wine bottle cork. It's greatThat said. they're probably my favorite. or one of my two. favorite pruners. Of many."
7,"These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants. herb garden. seasonal flowers. small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage. It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable."
7,"Sharp and precise pruning snips are here!  I used these pruning snips for my roses and mums.  I love the spring action handle as this was a great idea.  The tool is light-weight and the quality of Fiskars is one I can rely on.  The size is great and easy to carry with you when you have many plants to prune.  For those family members that like to borrow things and don't bring back. I labeled my snips 'Mom' so know one can use them without my permission as I want these back!"
7,"I have owned many pairs of this exact trimmer and will continue to do so. I lose them every 3-4 months. I have no idea how or why but i do. So i continue to purchase more. They are tight gripped. the spring is of high quality and will not wear after repeated long use. The shears are sharp and can get into tight spaces (what we need it for). For $11. this is one of the best trimmers you can buy. Enjoy and happy trimming"
7,"I'm really weary of buying things that are made in China. Fiskars is located in the USA. I'm unclear on the reason (RICH EXECUTIVES AND GREEDY BOARD OF DIRECTORS) why they would manufacture these snippers in China. Brings me down.Anyway. These are QUITE nice. very lightweight -- you will not be cutting anything more than thin plant material with these BUT they do reach in very nicely. nice thin blades. This operates on a naked steel wire spring. not a coiled spring. so I'm curious how long these are going to last. Comes with a thoughtful little orange plastic cone for the business end of the snippers.These are significantly superior to bonsai-type snippers or repurposed manicure scissors. Ideal for deadheading flowers. I love garden tools and these snippers are a real treat."
7,"I bought these to trim the leaves from my cannabis flowers and they work well for that. For any jobs that require more strength. get yourself something bigger/stronger.They're not perfect. they're not for heavy-duty cutting. and they're made in China.But they cut. I kept a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol around to clean the trichomes off the blades periodically and had no problem getting through my entire crop. My hands were sore.  but you'll have that after trimming a pound and a half of high quality cannabis.  To help ease the pain. I smoked some cannabis. Worked for me.*I am a fully RCW 69.51a compliant medical cannabis patient*"
7,"I always have this tool on me when I'm in the yard.  It's perfect for dead heading dense flowering plant without accidentally snipping the neighboring blooms.  It has a very sharp and strong blade so you can cut only using the very tip of the sheer.  Because the point is so narrow and sharp. it comes with a orange rubber sheath to protect the blade while it's in your pocket.My only gripe with this tool is the flimsy orange clasp which breaks off very easily if you are not careful.  I've owned several copies of these sheers and I've manage to break off the clasp on all three of them by clipping branches a little larger than recommended.  Fortunately. the orange sheath keeps the blades closed. assuming you don't loose it."
7,"I had to go with 4 stars because Amazon stated it was 7-inches long in the description but it's only 6-inches. I checked the Fiskars Website and they show it correctly at approximately 6' in length... but it's exactly that length and the cutting edge is 2'. I have a large hand and the length does make a difference for me and I kept pushing the locking lever closed because my hand covers it and my thumb pushes the latch forward. I did trim some lilac bushes with it and it's pretty easy to use. feels the same in either the left or right hand and is quite sharp. However. since I have about 30 more bushes to go I'm going with the larger pairFiskars 9920 Garden Multi-Snip with Sheathand these will fit much better in my wife's much smaller hand. If you have a small hand they you'll likely be going with 5 stars because I can't find any other issue with it."
7,"Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips. but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"After splitting hundreds of cords of firewood. this is the best splitting maul that I've used.  The hollow handle cuts down on the weight and the efficient design of the wedge make splitting wood much easier.  I was able to split 3-foot cedar rounds relatively easily after failing to be able to with my old splitting maul.  I use the 36 inch handle. but sometimes choke up a bit to get more force.  This is an excellent design that allows you to split wood more quickly with less effort."
7,"This is an item I purchased based on reviews.  I barely looked at any other splitting axes.The reviewers were right.I am new to splitting. but watched some videos to learn.  This is a solid axe. yet the lightweight handle gives a great balance and reduces fatigue versus heavier. wood versions.  I have a lot of Fiskars tools so I know their plastic-composite is incredibly strong.  They also have a great warranty.In short. if you use this axe how you are supposed to. you will not have a problem splitting logs."
7,"I wrote reviews on my other Fiskars products and this one is King of them All. I love this axe. With this woodsplitting axe you will not want to own any other splitter. This baby smashes through logs with one medium force swing. The logs explode. I couldn't believe how much wood I split the first day I had this axe. It comes with a great head cover. the axe is light and I think the handle is indestructible. Best money you will ever spend on an axe. especially for wood splitting. No wedges required."
7,"Unfortunately nothing beats gardena. They kepp tight even after years and years of usage. connect as well as disconnect easy.My parents have some that are at least 20 years old and still fine.I am not sure how many attachments are available in the US but in Europe. this is the Rolls Royce of water hoses. You can get sprnklers. waterguns whatever you can imagine....and of course they are REALLY expensive.....well. you get what you pay for.Before I forget. one thing that makes these connectors so great. Once you disconnect the water stops! No dripping and when you connect the &#34;hot&#34; hose...you will not get drenched......If I was unclear pls ask. I will answer if I can"
7,"I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy. but I gave them a try anyway.After only one month at the end of a light duty hose. the male end just snapped in half. The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap. Yup. it was under normal water pressure but it wasn't like I was using the hose as a tow rope. or pumping benzene through it.I've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years. but never snap in half like that.Next time I'll listen to that little voice."
7,"The size of this item as described is the very maximum outside dimensions.  Anything you want to put inside it will need to fit the interior of a box about 2 inches less on width. length and height.  Not saying the info is deceptive. just not as clear as it might be!  I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18&#34;.  I was able to make it work by leaving out the bottom tray and trimming away some of the reinforcing ribs in the lid...which reduces the strength making it unsuitable for sitting on but I didn't plan to sit on it anyway."
7,"I am very happy with this deck box. It is very roomy. I keep all my garden supplies there. It was very easy to install. just 5 min. snap all the parts and it is ready to use. It is sturdy too. We sit on it and it holds me. my husband and my 3 years old with no problems. I actually store there some vegetables and fruits. like potato and apples. when I do not have room in refrigerator and I know that animals won't get it. It nicely blends with my white walls of the house."
7,"The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100' hose full of water. The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose.  Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year.  This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk.  I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price.  It looks like it will work forever.  Also. this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8' hose.  It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft.  If I had it to do all over again. I would have purchased a quality reel the first time."
7,"This stove top smoker is one of the best products I have ever used (and I use it often).  I have had this thing for about 5 or 6 years now.  It is as good as the day I bought it.  I smoke chicken and ribs mainly but you can smoke just about anything that you could in a regular smoker (just not as much in terms of amount).  It is easy to clean and the wood chips are reasonable in price.  You only use about a teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on what you are smoking.  I would highly recommend this product.  The best wood to use is hickory (it is the all around best for all types of meats).  The next best as far as i have found is the Cherry.  It imparts a nice fruity taste to meat.  If anything happens to this smoker. I will certainly buy another one.  This product is one that lasts and lasts!"
7,"I just tried my stovetop smoker and was amazed at the results.  I've used a large outdoor smoker for years. and was skeptical about the stovetop smoker.  I used it to prepare chicken breasts. and they cooked fast and were juicy and tender. and had just the right amount of smoke flavor.  I'm looking forward to using my stovetop smoker for seafood and vegetables.  It's a great way to add flavor to food. and a very healthy way to cook.The smoker is constructed from heavy steel and is well made.  I could smell the smoke as the food cooked. but it wasn't intense and there was no smoke in the house.  I'll still use my outdoor smoker for batch cooking or for smoking large birds. but expect to get a lot of use out of the stovetop smoker."
7,"Used once and really like it. I smoked whole chicken. but I cut chicken in half and smoked about 1.5 hours on lower heat. The chips birned. so next time I would add more chips. I did have to finish chicket (to add some crispiness) in the oven for 10 min. The chicken came out excellent. best chicken I ever cooked. With chicken smoked potato and came out very nice as well with delicate flavor of smoke. Also. I considered as a bonus the aroma of smoked wood that fill out my house. loved it. It was not strong. but flavorful. Highly recommend this product."
7,"I've had this grill for about two months now and I love it. It's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black. rectilinear grill. This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great. Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking. the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish. steaks or skewered items. For sandwich-style grilling (e.g.. hamburgers. hotdogs. etc.) you can cook for twice that many. The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food. while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on. The Patio Caddie comes with hickory-scented briquettes that enhance the flavor and mask the gas scent.Be sure to consider the Patio Caddie if you're in the market for a high quality gas grill in this price range. You can't go wrong!"
7,"This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent. everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First. the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem. I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second. I grilled on it 2 days ago. on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks. should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars."
7,"With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets. kill them while they are torpid. and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring."
7,"By far. the most effective pest control for Yellowjackets I've ever come across.  How effective you ask?  We had a major Yellowjacket problem and I went to 4 stores...all of which were out of this trap.  At each store. there was at least 1 person (one place had 3) looking around for the traps because of the yellowjacket problems in this area.  Finally the 5th place I stopped had just restocked and their shelves were full...and yes. there were 2 people already picking them up when I arrived.Come home. put the solution on the cotton ball and by the end of the first 12 hours. we had caught 13 yellowjackets.  I come home tonight from work and we are now up to 25 yellowjackets this device has captured in under 24 hours!Now those are measurable results!EDIT:I just added a photo...over 40 yellow jackets trapped in just 3 days!"
7,"Does not seem to actually capture YJ's. but their annoying buzzing stopped when I put one of these about 20' outside of my veggie garden. Somehow it seems to work. YJ's. hornets. were making nests in the GROUND. in dying roots from pine trees which I had cut down YEARS ago...the roots seem to never completely rot. but leave a hollow which apparently invites these guys. And they are protective of their nest area.I use the stuff which comes with the trap. nothing fancy like apple juice and peanut butter.I bought a 2nd one this year for near an apple tree where these guys get their sips from fallen apples or apples which the birds have started to pick on. Hope it works there too.Recommend."
7,"I am guessing the 'attractant' used in these traps is derived from poop.WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES. and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds (thousands?) of flies inside the bag. It is NOT for the faint of heart.YUCK. It's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture.Flies are gross. a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse!Find a different solution."
7,"I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain. and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay."
7,". . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii. not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still. the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW. this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree. no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week. then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW. take two. I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick."
7,"We had a fly problem a few years ago. so I tried these traps. I was very impressed with the sheer number of flies it caught (my wife was just disgusted). This year we had a bigger infestation. so I tried theRescue Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant #FTA-SF4and they were nearly ineffective. I purchased a few more of these disposable traps and they're amazing at attracting and catching flies. The smell. however. is quite bad and is almost more offensive than a few rogue flies.The major advantage of this type of trap is that it works in the daytime. when flies are active. unlike an electronic trap like theFlowtron Model BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer (One Acre Coverage)(which I also purchased).The irony. I found. in having such effective attractants is that you get more flies. I moved my traps to the far side of the yard. away from the house. and suddenly we have fewer flies trying to sneak in the side door. (Obvious?)"
7,"I can't fathom a fly catching product working any better. We experienced a few flies in the house this Spring so we purchased this product. In less than one week. this product caught over two hundred flies. What is kind of funny is that this product attracts flies to it...who knew there were that many flies around my house. While the product captures many flies. it also attracts them.  Flies that were not necessarily a problem were captured. Day one a few flies are trapped. and each subsequent day--- by the fifth day. the amount of flies caught was unimaginable. I am going to rid the entire neighborhood of flies at this rate. I am going to stockpile this product."
7,"I have a four year German Shepherd and during the summer months the flies tend to munch on the tips of his ears. I have tries all types of all natural insect repellents. none of which ever worked. I also tried flys off which was fair but not 100%. not even 50% effective. So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem. I then searched Amazon. my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap. I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house. Within hours I saw many flies trapped and within a few days the number of flies in the area has decreased tremendously. I will buy more fly traps and if you have a problem with flys. you should too."
7,"These things work great!  Make sure you follow the directions to open/set it up. then fill it with water and hang someplace out of the way where the flies collect.  I've hung ours about 50 feet from our patio. under a pine tree where we have a quail block feeding the birds.  Lots of flies gather round there. and these traps fill up quickly.  Nary a fly makes it to our patio. even when we have our meals out there.  Before the fly trap. we were constantly swatting and shooing flies while sitting on the patio.  So glad I found these!  Only downfall. they are a little stinky. I can smell it when I walk by about 8 feet away. but since it's not close to our 'living space'. it's no problem."
7,"I am an ISA Certified Arborist. so I can tell you. as a professional. that this product beats all other similar products out there. hands down.  I use mine on the job just about everyday. and it stands up to pretty tough use.  It does go through webbing straps every now and then. but restringing new straps is easy. once you get used to it.  Customer Support at Fiskars is second to none.  They have replaced. at no charge. numerous webbing straps. the extension tube and a cutting head.  Rest assured. unless you are a professional out there. you will probably never have to change out anything on your unit.  If you ever have to though. I can assure you that Fiskars will be there to help you out. via their toll-free number and quick e-mail response team.  I recommend this unit and its smaller brother.  Both go into the trees with me. sixty feet and higher. and both give reliable service."
7,"Purchased this item at 11 AM.  Used free supersaver shipping. Received the next day. Unreal.  Apparently these are stocked in local warehouses. I live in a small Ohio city. The tracking number immediately showed a UPS exception. This was a first. The product itself is nice. Well made.  Easy to use.  Some commented on the shipping carton.  It was a long box. with 2 separate box pieces taped together.  The UPS man told me it looked like it may be damaged.  It was fine.  I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in.  The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage. The box is so odd shaped that nothing else will be piled on top. This will be a useful product. Added:  Minor dissapointment.  Just saw this in my big box grocery store for $ 69.00-full price. This is a full price store-not a discounter."
7,"This is a nice. light weight tool for trimming small branches high in trees and shrubs.  It easily cuts branches up to 1/2 inch.  The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is my experience with other Fiskars' tools with the same type of adjustable head. The head is a weak point. after a few months of use my experience is that the plastic head will fail.  Even though it has a lifetime warranty; returning for repairs is just too difficult to be worth the trouble."
7,"This was a nice idea. but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder. the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it. because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table. which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers."
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
7,"This charcoal slow-cooker & smoker does everything as advertised.  It is well made and easy to assemble.  I have done 2 cooks so far (baby back ribs. chicken. sirloin tip & salmon).  As long as you don't keep adding smoke-wood. but only do it at the beginning (and do it sparingly) you will have well cooked and flavorful food.  I recommend trying the 'best ribs in the universe' procedure for your first cook - found at [...]  I highly recommend this cooker and think you will do the same.  P.S. - Amazon.com has about the best prices and delivery you will find around."
7,"I used this in Vietnam. where the local butcher. Hang Kau Pung. asked me to use my gas grille for his yak. After butchering it. we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack. I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water. I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals."

7,"This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal. set the vents. and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good. try their best menu item and compare it to the 'Q' you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs. meatloaf. pork butt. spare ribs. and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it. you won't regret it."
7,"This is a great product.  It lives up to the Weber name.  The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape.  It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time. and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs. a 15 pound brisket. or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat. causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque!"

7,"I have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review.  The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do.  I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle. and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke.  If this happens. I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I'm not entering anything in a competition!  Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color."
7,"I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times. but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great."
7,"You won't find a better way to start your coals for the Webber Smokey Mountain cooker.  Following directions I had half of the coals I needed nice and white hot for my cooker in about 10 minutes.  It is built better than the ones I have seen at Ace Hardware and other places.  There is an inverted cone grill at the bottom that enables the starter to have more surface area for the newspaper sheets that you use to get the thing started.  You will not be sorry you ordered this along with your WSM cooker!"
7,"This past summer I tried a charcoal grill for the first time and as a result my gas grill was never taken out of the garage.  It's become an obsession of mine and now I have three different grills. one smoker and a collection of different wood chunks.  My newest obsession never would have taken root if there was not an easy. foolproof way of starting the lump or the briquettes.  I don't have any other chimney to compare this to but it works perfectly every time.  Two sheets of newspaper. dump in your fuel of choice and light it.  10-15 minutes later the coals are ready to go.  If you think the newspaper gives too much ash try paper towels sprayed with some cooking oil instead.  If you grill on a deck be careful when you light it or where you put it after dumping out the coals as it gets very hot."
7,"I haven't used lighter fluid in years. ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going. but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know. real wood. not gravel and clay briquettes). and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire. and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature. so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle. and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals. so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."
7,"I finally gave up on the lighter fluid and bought this last summer.  What a brilliant idea!  I have always used lighter fluid and was notorious for using to much because the charcoal wouldn't light fast enough.  That problem is solved with this chimney starter.  The coals ignite quickly and a full blaze is going within minutes!  Once the flames have died down. just dump them out and start grilling!I have the Performer grill but when I bought the grill. the store didn't have any cartridges so I have been using the chimney starter all summer.  So it's a nice backup if you have the Performer but no gas cartridge.This is a good product for the price."
7,"I have another no-name chimney starter that I bought a few years ago for around $15.  I've used it for cooking dutch oven for a couple of years and it has worked fine. or so I thought.  I recently purchased aWeber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smokerand bought this Weber Chimney Starter at the same time.  It is MUCH bigger than the generic starter I've been using. and the additional lift assist handle is great.  The conical grate inside the starter allows the charcoal to get up to temperature much quicker than my old unit.  I don't know what I'll use my old starter for now.  From now on. it's only Weber for me."
7,"As an avid griller and lover of cooking on charcoal. I can't say enough good things about the Weber Chimney starter.This simple to use chimney style starter quickly lights enough lump or briquette charcoal to fill your 22 1/2 inch weber grill WITHOUT LIGHTER FLUID!!Lighting is easy. Simply add charcoal to rim of chimney. place parafin lighters or newspaper in the bottom. Light newspaper or parrafin lighters and place on charcoal grate in grill.  In 20-30 minutes you will have orange hot smokin' charcoal.This is also a must for cooking things with very long cooking times such as turkeys or roasts.  About 30 minutes before adding additional charcoal. use this puppy to light your coals. and then add to the fire as needed.As I mentioned earlier. I reccomend using this in conjunction with the Weber parrafin charcoal lighters.  On windy days they are easier to use than newspaper.Once you use this you will never go back to using lighter fluid again.  A must have for anyone who owns a charcoal grill."
7,"this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill. with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it."
7,"Super fast shipping. Great addition to my Weber 221/2' Performer barbecue! What's confusing is that I called Weber's customer service and they told me that the rotisserie would not fit the Performer barbecue. OK then I e-mailed there tech staff. e-mail sent back also saying that the rotisserie would not fit the performer!(Neither correspondence could tell me why it wouldn't fit). I read the reviews on Amazon and there were two which said that the rotisserie fit and worked fine on their performers. So I purchased one and they are correct it fits and work's great.Thanks guys!! I will be calling Weber again today to dispute their claims!"
7,"After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight. I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning. A little over 2 hours later. I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop. The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen. The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal. So much for the other food groups. It was completely devoured. There was literally nothing left. My wife. daughters. and their friends kept repeating. &quot;That was the best turkey I ever had. You deserve a trophy!&quot; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I'm going to roast another bird.Folks. this is a must-get addition to this grill. Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose. I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I'm off to Safeway for another Butterball. I wonder where I'm going to put my next trophy?"
7,"This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews. the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless. the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill."
7,"This is a very sturdy little item for yard work. but it is very low to the ground to be handy to sit on if you have any back problems or you carry any extra weight.  Would be nice if it was a few inches taller.  The storage compartment under the seat is kinda inaccessible. and it would be nice if the seat popped up so you could get to what you store in there.  Would also be nice to have a 'tongue' so that you could pull it along."
7,"This is my second cart.  The old one is still serviceable in the garden after years of HOT and freezing weather.  I use this new one in the house to scoot around cleaning floor boards or anything hard to reach.  Saves my back. I haven't found it has a weight limit.  I have used it to scoot some pretty heavy stuff from place to place.  Unlike the description the top does not open although some of the photos on the box are a different model which does seem to have a hinged side.  No matter I just reach under.  It would be even better with a couple drainage holes. It can sometimes be difficult to roll on rough ground but given its light weight I just move it and sit back down. Highly recommend if bending is hard on your back."
7,"We actually have two garden carts this one and another that is all metal. The metal one even has a seat like those you see on an antique tractor. The metal one looks to be the better one HOWEVER my wife prefers the Garden Hopper over it. It feels sturdier than the metal one and does not tip as easily. I have noticed that the metal one now needs repainted and some bolts replaced. Not so with the Garden Hopper. It has sat out in the sun for days and it's paint has not faded. We do store it inside during the winter but we do that for the metal one too.My complaint is about the hinged lid. It takes too much force to open it. I realize that this is necessary because you don't want the lid coming open when you pick it up to carry it. Honestly it's just a minor complaint to me and does not detract in any way from the quality of this cart.All in all we are both happy with this cart."
7,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case. in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds. they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house. but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
7,"I've used the 'vaporizer' twice and love it!  I have a gravel driveway - what a pain to use Roundup to kill the little grasses and weeds sprouting in the spring; it doesn't take much to fry them plus. on a cold day. the gravel gets warmed by the torch so my feet stay toasty.  I was initially concerned about lugging around the big propane tank on my dolly - not a hassle at all. the torch extends about 10 feet out so a big area can be covered.  Just be careful with dry grass - it catches on fire easily so keep an eye out for persistent flames.  Otherwise. a big time-saver - I wish I had some snow or ice to melt."
7,"Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent. So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal. I love this product. It doesn't stop weeds from growing back. but you'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again. I am 6'2' and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer. but still love this product. The hose could be another 2 feet longer. but again. you want to own one of these weeddragons. The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop. I did not want to go inside when it got dark. Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles. One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby. but you'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby."
7,"This is well made and sturdy but I just don't find myself using it because it's so heavy to carry to the garden - especially if you're carrying tools as well.  Instead I usually end up taking along a light plastic low one-step stool from the dollar store.  It's true I do struggle getting up at times without those nice handles to push against but I don't have to lug the heavy thing around and for me that's more of a chore. It just doesn't feel comfortable either - the seat is too high and the kneeler too low and neither is very soft."
7,"I have owned this bench/kneeler for some years and would not part with it.  It is lightweight but amazingly strong.  It is a ready made seat for me in the garage. and it doesn't take up much space.  I am (unfortunately) 175 pounds. and this bench supports me easily.  Because of arthritis. the kneeler option is a must for me out in the garden not just because of my knees but because the bench's legs will help me stand up.  This is money well spent for anyone you know who is a serious gardener."
7,"I really like this bird feeder but not for the fact that squirrels can't get into it. I have two dogs that make sure that doesn't happen. Heck half the time they don't even let the birds on it. But I love it because I went out the other day and four of my six bird feeders looked fine and had seed in them but when I inspected them the seed mix had gotten wet and clumped up so it no longer would come out of the feeder. Not this feeder! The water can't get in to the seed area because the squirrel begone hood. This was the only feeder that was completely empty even though it was the newest edition and held the most seed. It's a hit with me. the birds. and maybe even the dogs!"
7,"I probably would of given this a better score if the design of where the two little prongs are. was different. They support all the weight of this big bird feeder. and its heavy when filled...its good its a big one. filling less often interests me. BUT...the large plastic tube has two little holes drilled in it to have a little piece of metal stick into each hole to hold this. and I am thinking in time. just from the elements and the sun/heat that with taking this apart to fill. refill. etc the plastic will fatigue...then you have a very expensive bird feeder that the squirrels can't even TRY to get into anymore.To me the design of it and how it will probably not last too long is important as this is a pricy feeder. On the upside. it was easy to assemble. I was interested as to where it was made. it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts. Draw your own conclusions."
7,"Between the weight controlled port closure and the tilting and wobbling dome. this bird feeder certainly lives up to its claim of being squirrel proof. BUT it lets so much birdseed fall out of the bottom as the base tilts under the weight of even the tiniest bird that squirrels and large birds can gather up as much birdseed they wish.Probably not quite the solution to the problem you were looking for.Note: The bird feeder comes mostly assembled. and I made no attempt to check the already assembled parts.  After a month one of the perches somehow unscrewed itself and fell off.  I recovered the perch and the nut but could not find the locking washer.  If the locking washer was never there. that would readily explain how the perch came off. and when I checked the other three they were still tight.  So it might be worth a couple of minutes of your time checking that all four perches are screwed in tight when you first unpack it."
7,"When I received this product. the bolt to tighten the baffler was not the correct size so I called the manufacturer. They were quick to respond and sent me a second whole bird feeder. The issue with the second one is that it was missing all of the hardware. Since I received this as part of the Vine program. I was not going to waste any more of my time trying to get this manufacturer to ship out the correct parts.We gerryrigged the baffler. but it makes removing it to put more seed in very laborious. So far after 2 weeks no birds. It does take awhile to get birds to a new feeder.Why the one star? Too expensive and the manufacturer has obvious problems with packaging. Not worth the time and money. Buy something for less money. A hint on keeping squirrels away from feeders is to remove any from areas where squirrels can jump to. We have six feeders and no squirrels. Now deer are another thing altogether!"
7,"The assembly is easy and the design is good but not perfect as it does not stop small chipmunks getting at it. But this feeder prevents squirrels from feeding on the seeds. I have used this over the past one month and we have few chipmunks in the yard to cause enough trouble at the feeder. When a squirrel jumps at the feeder. the metal dome tilts and wobbles to throw the critter off balance. The weight-activated base also tilts to close off the four feeding ports. The feeder is designed satisfactorily and the metal dome and feeding base is well constructed. The glossy heavy-duty powder coated finish protects the feeder from sun and rain. I have rated three stars for its quality and overall performance.1.Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder"
7,"I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof. EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging. no squirrels. great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price. I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!"
7,"This is a nicely made feeder. easy to assemble. fill with seed and hang.  I have had it up for about a week and so far no squirrells have  been able to get to the  food!  I have it hanging from a shepards hook  that  is cemented into the ground! The birds have had no issues that prevented or made it difficult for them to eat at the feeder.While it is nicely made. easy to assemble etc. it is in no way worth $72!!!  I can't imagine anyone paying that kind of money for a bird feeder that is suppose to keep squirrels out of it."
7,"I let the feeder hang for about a week under 4 different trees.I would purposely put some bird feed on the ground in hopes that they would eat it and then move up to use the feeder.For some reason I never could entice them to try it.Even squirrels climbing neighboring trees and the tree it was hanging from ignored it.The design seems to make sense but I think the main problem is the way the little metal perches are sticking out instead of being in front of the seed dispensor like a more traditional feeder.Maybe when the ground is covered in snow it would draw birds to it.Or maybe in the spring when birds are busy making a nest they would try the easy supply of food.But here in the late summer/early fall they just avoided trying it."
7,"All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct. The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed. On the feeder I received. the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it's stuck to a window. Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill. and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups. Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it's not worth paying the postage to send it back. Despite the much higher cost. I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects."
7,"I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window. under an awning on the northeast side of the house. not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact. I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately. nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...."
7,"I too had trouble at first and gave this feeder a bad review but after fully reading the directions the brackett with suction cups separates from the bottle . I suggest you clean the window fully . which I did and it has never come down . been up for at least a month. When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other. It also does not leak. Since the brackett separates from the bottle it is very easy to apply suction cups to window. Forget all that about rubbing the suction cups with friction to make it stick."
7,"This set of three. multi-colored bottle brushes is perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports and other small holes and places.  For example. I have reserved one to clean out the small spouts in my fountain which tend to clog with algae as the summer wears on.  Each brush is about 3.5 inches long. with a tapered head that begins at 1/8 inch and widens at the base to 1/4 inch.  The brushes can crush down to a much more narrow diameter than that. of course -- the width of the wires that hold the brushes. less than 1/16 of an inch.  The plastic handles are rigid. although they can accidentally be snapped in two with pressure.  The wired support of the brushes themselves is only slightly flexible; you won't be able to work these brushes around corners and inside the base of a feeder bottle.These are basically short. rigid. reusable pipe cleaners.  They are perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports or any other job requiring those qualities.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
7,"This little light is easy to assemble. needing not much more than a screw driver to tighten the nut and screw. Once it is clamped down on another sturdy object. it stays put.  It doesn't wobble or come undone.  The cord is five feet long.  Depending on how far away this lamp is from the plant. the effective radius is plenty enough (about 24' from a foot away).  I use this over a germination set next to my bird cage. and my little dove gets some of that light as well.One thing about this that may be dangerous to other users:  the black hood that goes around the socket gets VERY HOT!  This lamp would not be recommended around birds or small children.  However. set in a nice location this is a pretty lamp that provides good swivvel and warmth.This clamp comes with a 60-watt bulb. packed in its separate cardboard support."
7,"There is no reason for the manufacturer to put red food coloring into this mix. There are numerous concerns about the effect on hummingbirds.  This is reason enough to not buy this product.  Buy a product without the dye.Better yet. just buy sugar.  Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar.  Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved.  You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food.  Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.CAUTION.  DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey. use only sugar.  Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds.  Sugar Only!"
7,"I love Perky-Pet feeders. but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything. especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil. and 1 part white sugar. let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this. you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes. and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar. and small insects."
7,"Here's some opinions I have after using this blower for a couple of weeks now.1. The vacuum bag is hard to take off. I seen in another comment that. do not to slip in in all the way. Haven't tried that yet2. The On/Off knob. Sometimes I found I bumped into it with my hand causing it to move it's position.3. I found it easier to let the bag lay on the ground instead of using the strap around the shoulder when vacuuming leaves.4. The Magnesium Impeller will fit on this unit. I ordered and installed the Magnesium Impeller from Toro model 51598. (thanks to Allen who commented about that in his review)5. Would be nice if it had one more lower setting on the blower6. It's very light and has plenty of power"
7,"Received this Toro for Father's Day and I love it. Sweeping and raking are two of my least favorite yard chores. and this unit has instantly become one of my indispensible tools. Although I was able to vacuum up green hedge trimmings w/o any real problem. I went ahead and ordered the replacement impeller from the heavy duty Ultra model (they are interchangeable). for an additional $30. I was going to mount it right away. but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears. then switch to the magnesium one. It makes sense to do this. as the magnesium impeller is very light. yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra. which helps at the end of the day."
7,"This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard. but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to. but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner. you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall. we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH"
7,"After using a heavy metal mower for years. this was a blast of fresh. light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER. we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend. and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then. too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next...."
7,"I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it. and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality. cost (no gas) and quick startup. it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well. was very quiet."
7,"I bought this product back in 2004. replacing an older gas mower after my neighors house caught fire from a leaking gas can in his garage. Used the electric mower until 2007. when I treated myself to a mow/blow/go gardner. I just stuck the machine out in the side yard and never touched it. In July 2008. I pulled it out to mow a newly planted lawn not covered by my mow/go guy. Plugged it in. and it started right away. try that with a gas mower. My new house has 2300 sf of front and back lawn. this mower just gobbles up that lawn. It does bog down in taller/thicker patches. hence only 4 stars. But it gives a nice clean cut. Changing the blade was easy. And it does a nice job of mulching. my lawns look great. I will never own a gas mower!"
7,"I originally chose a more expensive knee pad. ignoring these because of the single strap. However. when the ones  I ordered didn't work right. I came back to these. The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me. Immediate pain. However. I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee (which actually pulls the cup into place better) and even crawling around. the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater. so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them.  They fit me nicely. and once I adjusted the strap. very comfortably. The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side."
7,"This is not what you want for heavy duty wear. like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener. with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half. these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty. too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice. I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints."
7,"I bought these for two reasons: 1 - I paint a lot (walls).  2 - I have little nieces and nephews who like to ride on my back as I crawl on the floor!  For the former. they work great-  they don't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders. etc.  I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees.  It's great.  My knees aren't the best and these help a lot!  For the latter reason. they're great too!  I can quickly get these on and then let one or two (or three!) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house!  Good excercise and quite tiring!  But for the price - you can't go wrong."
7,"I made the huge mistake of buying a cheap $2 trowel from my local HD. of course. it literally snapped at the handle while doing some light digging.The Fiskars trowel on the other hand. is built to last. I couldn't really tell from the pictures. but once I inspected and held it. I could feel the quality and after testing it. I noticed a huge difference. the way it handles dirt/soil and the little work it takes to dig. is simply great.What I like the most is the design. the handle is a  solid metal piece. thick and extremely durable. It didn't bend while digging and it felt very comfortable. The handle is wrapped in a rubberized sleeve which happens to be very ergonomic.Nothing much to say really. This is great gardening tool that I'm sure will last."
7,"I use this heavily to till the soil in my flower beds because of its broad shoulders and sharp point.  Although its used mostly for troweling. it's  narrow enough to be used for planting and broad enough for transplanting.  I have a tool for every job but I find this is the only digging tool I really need to bring along.  If you're debating which type of  hand digger to get (planter. transplanter. troweler. etc.). I would stick with this trowelerThe handle is very comfortable. important when jabbing it into the ground repeatedly to loosen the soil.  The wooden tools I've used in the past have been very hard on my hands but. I come away with no pain with this design.The polished alumnium is VERY strong. light weight. mostly scratch resistant and does not rust.  The textured material on the handle does collect dirt and has to be scrubbed to get clean."
7,"I've used this for around a year now. absolutely love it.  I keep getting more gardening tools and haven't ran out of pockets yet.  The pockets are all different sizes. some very narrow for something like a pair of scissors or a marker. there is a big one that fits my PH tester perfectly.  I also have theCustom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Bucketswhich turns the bucket into a chair and seals the interior if you want a dry spider-free place for gardening gloves."
7,"Do you find yourself constantly looking for the last hand tool you used when working in the flowerbeds? Are you forever walking back and forth to get the right tool. or to toss the weeds you just dug up in a lawn bag? If so. you need a garden caddy. and you could do a lot worse than this model. While it's not made of heavy-duty canvas like the $60 models. it's strong enough for every day use. and it can last through several buckets. I bought this one for my girlfriend. a passionate gardner. and she's very pleased with it. Might even get one for myself."
7,"Using these in Japan. I have used them previously in Canada. They were sent to me by family since I wouldn't have purchased them again. In my case at least. Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate...at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night. It was the same back in Canada. at least the kill rate wasn't any better with the cartridges. The other down side to these (if they do have any effect) is that it's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind. If the mosquitos' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great...if not. then what? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these...I would just hang another zapper. I'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective."
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
7,"I would have given this five stars but the connections loosen with use and I have had to hand tighten the connection right beneath the scarecrow head a couple of times.  I use the two scarecrows to scare critters from our newly created garden pond.  I bought the two scarecrows along with Yard Sentinel's RC Ultrasonic Pest Controller.  They work in unison and are effective!  I have the Yard Sentinel set to only operate after dark for raccoons and any other four-legged critter.  Everything has remained undisturbed.  And. I did not put on the yellow stickers so they are solid black and (to me) less obtrusive.  This was a great investment."
7,"It sprays water but the cats just walk beyond the area that gets sprayed. They don't seem to care.They (I have two) have a tendency to break. The settings dial never worked properly. and even when turned off for four weeks somehow ate the battery.Animals must be large. probably raccoon or bigger. Definitely doesn't go off for birds or squirrels (though butterflies immediately in front of the sensor sometimes did.) For me it is a source of aggravation and would probably serve me better used as a projectile."
7,"This product not only works well. but it's also fun to watch!!. especially when rabbits. cats. or dogs come to do their business in your loan or rabbits eating your grass. this thing blast them with a burst of water before they can escape!! I love watching this in the early moring hours. Also when a dog or cat wants to take a poop in your yard and the owner of the pet just lets them do it with cleaning up behind them. this thing will blast the animal with water and they will run away from you property. Have fun watching!!"
7,"I was skeptical that this scarecrow would deter the deer in my yard.  I'm very glad that it exceeds expectations!  I placed it facing the parts of the yard where the deer trails end.  Heard it go off during the night a few times during the first week. followed by the sound of snorting and stamping deer.  For the first time in years my yard is not a deer buffet--as a matter of fact NOTHING in my yard has been browsed this year.  So glad to finally see some perennials that I haven't seen in five years.  I have tried all kinds of things in the past to deter them and nothing works.  If you have deer problems I highly recommend giving this a try.  If only there was something for winter (besides deer netting)."
7,"Everytime I forgot and walked out onto the the lawn. I got sprayed pretty good.  That's the problem with this unit. You either have to leave it on all the time and get soaked or remember to turn it on every night before you go in..........or buy an outdoor  timer and hook it up to the hose. which I ended up doing.  The Deer ate 25 flats of impatients I planted last year....... along with 15 Hostas. Daylilies. Verbina. Phlox and anything else they decided to munch on.  Bought these toward the end of the season so I'm not sure if they did any good to deter the deer...........they pretty much ate everything before I  got it.  We'll see next year  ( 2013 growing season) and report back."
7,"My daughter gave me the scarecrow years ago and it sat in my garage until a few weeks ago. I am currently replacing her rear yard fence and her idiot neighbor has a dog that started coming into her yard and relieving himself on her grass. Needless to say this women is a real jerk who takes no responsibility for her kids or pets. I remembered having the scarecrow and immediately put it in her rear yard. It has worked flawlessly keeping the little monsters. both canine and human on their own property. Her other neighbors asked me about the motion activated sprinkler. they are also having problems with the kids and dog and are now getting their own."
7,"I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden.  I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all  my requirement perfectly.  I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes. it works well in small places. and it gets all the grass in one pass.  After two summers I am still using the original string. and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review"
7,"This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however. it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all. this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it."
7,"I hate to think of myself as having fun at some other creature's expense but - BWAHAHAHA. bite THIS. you bloodsucking fiends!!I first saw this being used on a vacation to St. John.  The employees in the cantina each had one. and were waving them around slowly in front of their faces. almost in a hypnotic way.  Apparently that is the best way to get mosquitoes. according to these folks (who should be VERY familiar with mosquitoes and their ways!)  If you try to swat at them too fast you will just blow them away. but if you move the paddle around slowly they will just fly right into it and go sizzle sizzle sizzle ...!  ;^)Heed what everyone says though: don't hit yourself with it while the buttons are pressed. and don't let kids 'play' with it.  It can give you a nasty burn."
7,"I don't own these but saw them at a flea market. No question in my mind why they were up for sale (but should have gone in the trash IMO!) My friend discovered -- the hard way! -- that these deliver a VERY unpleasant shock if touched to human skin! Mind you. this friend is a large manly guy. not easily affected. yet he howled and dropped it! So you can imagine the jolt of voltage that must have been involved here! I would not want my children in the same room with these devices. nor my father with his pacemaker. or even my pets to inadvertantly come in contact with the live zapper screen. What were they thinking!?!?!?"
7,"Really. this is a very effective means of pest control. The safety feature of having two buttons pressed in order to activate it. and having them displaces so you dont accidentally turn it on is nice. When you strike. you get a big blue jolt. which from my experience. makes it fun for the kiddos. Also. i touched the racket while it was on....the current is definitely pretty strong. It wont kill a person. but it does hurt. which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much. much smaller insects. They dont always die first zap. but it always stuns them at the least. allowing you to toss them outside or dispose of them however you see fit.A good way to spend $10 IMO."
7,"This is the cheapest made product I've ever owned.  To insert the 2 batteries. there is no flap that you open.  You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver. then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor.  Insert the batteries. put circuit board and switches back in. insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut (3 each). hoping the screw doesn't fall out while you're holding the nut.  Are you kidding?  I'm returning this. because I don't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries.  I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries. you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle."
7,"This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves. branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days. I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap. the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended."
7,"I use a tumbler that I rotate every few days.  I sprinkled a cup of this into the compost that was already in there. with some fresh vegetable skins dropped into it. and within a few days there was a noticeable increase in the matter. with a black. rich compost all around.Now mind you. I live in southern Arizona and we already get the hot. dry heat this time of year.  I don't plant my summer garden until the monsoons hit in July. By then this compost will be ready.  I can actually use what is in the tumbler now for my growing tomatoes.  I keep the compost damp and turn the tumbler regularly.  The outside heat helps keep the matter hot.One thing I noticed when I first used this on my compost is that the bugs that were already in the tumbler scrambled.  Apparently even beetles and roaches give way to this stuff.  And that is a good sign."
7,"I bought a rotating composter last summer. It took all summer to turn my yard waste into compost. Actually. by the end of the last summer. while the compost was almost done. it was too late in the season for me to use so I just left it in the composter. This spring I had great compost. That's almost a year for that batch. This year I am hoping to speed things up a little.This product contains the microorganisms to get things started quickly. I added this product to my yard waste a few weeks ago. I have already noticed an improvement on the progress of the compost process compared to last year. Hopefully I will have usable compost ready to spread in the garden by the end of summer."
7,"It can be quite hard to get a compost pile going. We have tried a couple different ways and couldn't really get what you are suppose to get from a compost pile. we would always end up with just garbage and flies. We researched online and watched a lot of videos. It has to have a certain mixture of types of things that you add. We had way too much household food in ours. We also decided to forgo our compost bin and decided to go with a tumbler composter after a couple failed attempts in our bin.This Ringer Compost Plus helps get your compost going. We are now having much better luck. I suggest doing some research yourself if you are just beginning. There is more to composting than just throwing your scraps and coffee grounds into a bin.Spring is the perfect time to start and the Compost Plus gives it a head start."
7,"I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps. brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process. but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process. I'll be purchasing more."
7,"I've been working on a compost bin for about a year now. and noticed lately that it wasn't heating up as much as it had in the beginning. When I received the RINGER COMPOST PLUS I added about half the box to my current compost pile (a turning drum style) and by the next day found that the head had returned which means the composting process is back in full swing. My ONLY complaint. and it's minor. is the smell(!) of the contents of the box! You certainly don't want to store it in your home or even in your garage - it's THAT strong. I wrapped mine in plastic to keep it dry and tucked it under a sheltered area near the garden. But hey... smell or no smell. this stuff works!"
7,"Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker. it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings. leaves. and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then. though. it has gotten me started on composting."
7,"I've had a 'passive' compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years. I'll start a new pile. and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening. I thought a more active. rapid compost would be nice. so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions. kept the pile moist. turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference. though honestly. I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster. but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter. then maybe it will work differently or better for you."
7,"But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost. with an approximate ratio of 1:2. and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate. or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around. as they would be most places. this product isn't strictly necessary. but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though. it's likely to help out."
7,"I have been making compost for several years now. I have a compost tumbler with a crank handle that rotates it. I started a batch in late winter and was having a hard time getting it to heat up. This compost starter did a great job of really getting it going. If it is really cold outside you will have to be more careful to have your ingredients shredded and in the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio. Otherwise this starter will work well if you have more brown than green. In the summer when I am composting mostly greens. then this starter is pretty much unnecessary. I save some of the finished compost from each batch to start the new batch with. If you are doing a passive pile then this stuff is even more of a help because you can add it to each new layer as you build the pile."
7,"I have a compost bin (two actually) and can't wait to use it in my garden this year! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better. richer. darker. I love this product! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost. What??!! Doesn't everyone add paper? Well. I called the company and after a few passes around the office. I was told. then confirmed by another employee. that they don't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and shouldn't use in composting. So. they just wrote 'no paper' on their box. Easier for them I suppose. but I'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine.  Hope this helps! Happy composting!Sheri - writer. mom. mage"
7,"I will have to review this product at the end of the summer to give a better idea of the help/quality of the product.  My first impressions were that this was a small amount of stuff.  I also think that it stinks.  I am going to use it in a compost bin. rather than the recommended ground idea.  I don't like to leave compost on the ground. as it attracts rodents.  So far my stuff has been in there for three weeks.  Will update again later."
7,"We have an open air compost pile that has both yard and kitchen waste. After putting a fresh batch of veggie scraps and egg shells on the pile. I poured the recommended amount of Ringer 3050 Compost Plus 2 over the pile and watered as directed.  A week later I checked the pile and the kitchen waste was already unrecognizable. The Ringer 3050 Composte Plus 2 was doing a nice job of helping the scraps and shells break down.Can't wait till the compost is ready in a couple of months to use in my garden."
7,"When I first bought a rotary barrel-type composter I was really excited to get some nutrient rich material for my garden.  Unfortunately it wasn't that easy.  I followed directions but it never seemed to do what it was supposed to do.  The grass stayed green and wet and the leaves stayed dry and brown.I started using the Ringer Compost Plus over a month ago and I can honestly say that it has made a difference.  FINALLY I am getting the type results that I had been wanting.  There might be another way of accomplishing this without a compost starter but for me this is working just fine."
7,"I have had this since 2011 and used 8-10 times so far with no issues. Best chain saw on a pole for the money. Works great for cutting branches. Beats a hand saw type hands down.After my first use of the chain saw I was thoroughly impressed. It worked great for cutting small to medium size branches. I would highly recommend this product for anyone interested in a chain saw on a pole.Keys to keeping this working well is keep the chain oiled. It does not do this automatically like a normal chain saw.Moving the cord around is kind of a pain but no more then I use this it is fine. I saved a bunch vs a gas unit and maintenance is much easier."
7,"Well had this item for about a month now. and I shall say it is a great saw. the only down side of it is once it is on the pole and fully extended. it is a bit on the heavy side. but other than that this saw is just great. lots of power. blade/bar size is perfect for cutting through damn near everything. easy to use. I mean this thing is so much fun to use it should be illegal :)  Changing unit from pole saw to chain-saw is so simple even a caveman could do it (like me).  So if your looking for a great quality pole-saw/chain-saw I would definitely give this on a try."
7,"This saw is awesome. Took it out for it's first use today. Great power on demand at the push of a button. no worries about gas or oil. just the lube the chain and you're good to go. Sliced through moist maple like butter. Handled branches up to 8' with ease. It did. however. throw its chain after an hour of use. which was entirely my fault; do what you're supposed to. and adjust the tension are the new chain has warmed up (and therefore expanded!) a bit. A great. versatile tool!"
7,"Lots of reviews so I'll keep it short.  I've used this both on. and off the pole to the point where if it died I'd still be happy with it. but it's still going strong.  Lots and lots of use.  I keep it sharp. adjusted and use the prescribed 30 weight chain oil.It also allows me to make cuts either from the ground. or on a ladder. when I'm in a better position to get out of the way if something falls.  We've used this to safely make the final cuts on limbs that were still hanging from a gas chain saw cut."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"Besides the cost of propane and attractant cartridges you have to buy about every 21 days. you need to figure in the cost of using 1 of the CO2 Quick-clean cartridges at each tank refill. at a cost of about $4 each. Depending on what you pay for the propane. attractant and CO2 cartridges. it sums up to a cost of $20 around or more at each tank refill. Since you have to refill the propane tank. replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days. this adds up to an operating cost of over $400 per year! I'm posting this because it is something you may need to budget for and should seriously consider before buying."
7,"It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring. including wasting three of the 'clean out' cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product."
7,"Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006. after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them. there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon. but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away."
7,"I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad. the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board."
7,"I have had really good luck with Fiskar's products and thought I would give the grass shears a try.  The have lived up to my expectations and then some.  The rotating head is a really nice feature that I've not seen on other brands. When trimming the grass near the concrete steps and brick walkway. the rotating head allows me to get very close so I am able to make an even cut.  The blade is very sharp. even after several uses with no sign of rust.  The blade locks in place and makes storage easy so I don't have to worry about cutting my fingers when reaching for it in the tool shed.  Great product!"
7,"Though I have several string trimmers. there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front. If I accidentally cut those vines. I'll be in big trouble. and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks.  The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well. and though I only use them a few times a year. they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely."
7,"I purchased this exact model from my local 'Wal-Mart' and actually paid more than I would have here. but I needed some clippers and fast.First off. they are not rigid at all..  What I mean is. as long as you are clipping a few blades of grass. you are ok. but really put it to use. and you soon find that it will lock blades and not function. This is due to the very poor construction.  Too much 'slop' between the blades often make either both blades lock together or separate so much that nothing is cut.If you really want a good set of clippers that actually work. look further as this is a 'novelty' item more than an actual functioning tool."
7,"I bought this thing when they still had the wooden handles.  Being an avid sewer. I am quite familiar with Fiskars scissors and have many pairs that I rely on and have for many. many years.  So. when I saw these at the local garden store. it was a no brainer in my mind.  SO glad I have these!  Of ALL the tools like this I've owned over the years. this set of Loppers from Fiskars is the only set that hasn't broken. become jammed. or some other weird thing.  I clean them after each use to keep diseases spreading from plant to plant.  They're amazingly easy to use. especially for women. and boy. the clean cuts it makes just makes everything you do a breeze.  One of those items I am SO glad I found!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
7,"Love these loppers - I've been using them for almost a year now.  Great for those jobs where I used to use small hand pruners that took lots & lots of effort (you know those branches that are really too big for hand pruners. but that you don't want to get the big giant loppers out for. so you squeeze & squeeze the pruners until the branch is finally cut??)  These cut SO easily & cleanly that they're a pleasure to use.(As an aside. I had an old pair of Fiskars hand pruners that had become badly misaligned.  I called the company to inquire about how I could fix them. and they just replaced them for me.  Great customer service!)These loppers are really for relatively close branches; should you need to prune branches that are farther away. you'd want to buy longer ones.Highly recommended."
7,"Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade.  Feeling embarrassed. I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I'd broken.  Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days.  I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly.  How often does that happen these days?  (I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old. thick branches.)"
7,"Has the usual (very slight) fade after 5 months. BUT it is not very noticeable I only mention it because I notice everything (live in SB.Cali and we get moisture/sun every day). The material is thick and sturdy...I bought this for my 48-50 inch grill so it would fully cover the sides and it is working out great. Cover would get 4.5 stars but I rounded down due to the color of green being slightly different. to me. that what it looks like in the photos. Will update after a full summer if it holds up and doesn't crack. then bump up to 5 stars."
7,"I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota. where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather.  The cover has held up wonderfully.  The only word of caution is on the color.  It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels.  They may be green when you first buy the cover. but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill.  To me. this is a minor drawback. but others might find it more objectionable."
7,"I bought these to take care of a mosquito larvae problem in my bog garden. They work well and the frogs are not bothered by them at all. I have a few rare green frogs in the bog here and the dunks don't harm them at all. This particular package. however. was very dry and it seemed like they just crumbled after hitting the water. It does not reduce their effectiveness at killing larvae. but it's not a very attractive result. especially if you have water lilies or water plants. You end up with a lot of bits of cork floating around and getting all over everything. Guess that's better than a bunch of mosquitoes. but..."
7,"I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with!We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you don't care about nature and other living beings!  Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this . but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you cannot throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison!Terrible product!"
7,"These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small. outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good. I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally. I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars."
7,"I bought this to restring my Black and Decker Trimmer. I used to buy the pre-strung cartridges from them. but they cost a small fortune compared to using this. I have re-strung two carts. and have had great success with them after using this product. The line feeds through just like the original line and does not seem to go any more quickly than the original. Definitely a great way to save money if you don't mind spending a few minutes restringing.EDIT - 5/10/12After over 2 seasons of trimming. weedwacking. and edging - I still have tons of string left! What a great investment! My property is not very large. about an average size lot for Southern New Jersey. (around 3500 sq feet of lawn space)."
7,"Ok....I have not had to re-string my weed-eater yet. but two things with this item. I bought this because it was recommended by Amazon with the purchase and the cost was reasonable.The things you should know..............1) Realize you are purchasing a spool of trimmer line. not a package that you can just plug into your trimmer. When I get to where I have re-strung the trimmer I bought (the GreenWorks 21212 4 Amp 13&#34; Corded String Trimmer) I will update this.2) The string seems to be of a much heavier gauge than what shipped with the trimmer. Again. I will update when I re-string. but I am hoping the replacement string will work fine.Again. I don't know all the specifics. but  I wanted to alert people to the oddities I encountered in the purchased and visual examination.  It may work just fine and when I get to that point where I am actually using it. I will update the review and star rating."
7,"I cooked a Turkey on my Charcoal Rotisserie for Thanksgiving 2010. I used the Pecan Wood Chips according to the instructions on the bag. and WOW!!! They put a taste into that Turkey that is hard to describe!!  It was so delicious and jucy. I always wondered what Pecan Wood smoke would do to meat. and now I know. No turning back now. I must try some Ribs with these chips next. and a Roasting Chicken.....mmmmmmmmm!!  Highly recommended. Will purchase again."
7,"I couldn't find this at my two local hardware stores. they didn't stock any bar and chain oil surprisingly. I used this in my newHusqvarna 450 18-Inch 50.2cc X-Torq 2-Cycle Gas Powered Chain Saw With Smart Start (CARB Compliant)and it works great. They don't recommend you use any motor oil or different purposed oil so I definitely recommend this product. I had some husqvarna chain oil in my last chainsaw for years. and to be honest I can't find any difference in noticeable viscosity or functionality of that product over this (it was a lot more expensive)."
7,"If you do a lot of tree trimming or cutting you know the value of good chain oil.  You need to use it to prolong the life of your chain and bar for your chain saws.  I just trimmed 18 large trees and this oil helps to cut quickly through the large branches and protect and extend the life of your expensive chainsaw parts.The thing about chainsaw oil is that it is stickier than regular oil because of an additive to enhance the viscosity and it stays on the bar better to lubricate it while it is doing its job.  It also does not sling off the chain as quickly as motor oil. When oil slings off the chain and bar. a lot of it is going onto you. your clothes and shoes. When you are trimming a tree above your head it is nice to have it not dripping back down onto you.This is a good product and I recommend it!"
7,"After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests. none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read '6'... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon. so these tests give unreliably 'alkaline' results). The purified water test also came out 'alkaline'.  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result. 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K. P. or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes. 20. 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read 'adequate' for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either. so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So. all in all. it was a tremendous waste of money and time."
7,"A decent quality product that appears to be more or less accurate however. I'm not thrilled with the fairly ambiguous rating system for the test results:  I conducted all four tests on a veggie garden soil sample.  The pH test was great - clear results.  The N. K and P test parameters are pretty loose. though.  Essentially. you can tell whether your soil is deficient but it's pretty difficult to discern the difference between the &#34;adequate&#34; reading and the reading indicating an overabundance of the given substance.  I posted a customer pic on the vendor's listing to illustrate results.  Who knows if they will post it.  I don't think I would re-purchase this item."
7,"I am  Master Gardener and I must admit I broke the Cardinal rule of gardening. I never test my ground.  Even when the MG program offered it to me for free when I graduated. I could not be bothered.  I thought I could adjust my garden when I needed it myself without any help from a test kit.  Until I moved. this house has a wonderful piece of property that I use for my vegetable garden and for the first three years everything was perfect. until this year.  Nothing wants to grow. so I broke down and bought this item. low an behold I have a problem. nothing major but my phosphorous is completely depleted and that is the explanation for the way my veggies are growing.  I found out what must be done and I did it and everything is turning around..Good sound product I recommend it to the gardener that thinks he/she knows it all. (but we really don't.)"
7,"I like the 10' size.  It holds a substantial pot. whether you change the plant three times a year. or keep one perennial as I do.  The holder goes onto your deck rail in a few minutes.  While it is not heavy duty. it will hold even a tall pot easily and securely.  Holds enough soil for a second story deck like mine to trail a vine twenty feet. or a huge Swiss or trailing begonia.  Not much else to say except no problems and sturdy enough to last for years."
7,"This hanger works great for hanging my potted plants from my side porch. I don't have an overhang to hang plants from hangers. so prior to this. I was only able to set my flowers out on my side porch on my table. not hang them. This holder slides right over the railings of my porch and lets me hang flowers off the side so they are viewable from my driveway and the street out front. It's also a nice solution when you don't want to drill anything permanent into your porch to hang flowers. Just slide this holder over a railing and set your potted flowers inside. that's all there is to it! I like that I can also move this to other areas of my porch. if my flower are in need of more sun."
7,"This attractive black pot holder installs easily. I appreciated the versatility as it can fit 2 x4' to 2x 6' inch railing. I am not mechanically inclined but was able to affix this to my deck with no problems. It is designed with a 'bumper' which prevents the pot from tipping. The black color should blend with just about any d&eacute;cor.This is a convenient way for me to keep a pot of fresh herbs in close proximity to the grill on my deck.  The hardware seemed a bit flimsy but so far it has held. This is a good way to bring a color to your deck. balcony or fence. Recommended."
7,"CobraCo's adjustable flower pot holder is a flexible product that can be used to fit on deck railing up to 4 inches across.  The brackets easily attach in 1 of 2 configurations depending on the width of your rail.  There are 3 screws on each side to lock the bracket down.  There is a bottom bumper support to rest against a post or rail to keep the plant level.  The holder easily accommodates a plant pot of up to 10 inch diameter.This is an easy way to beautify your deck.  Just add plant. and water."
7,"I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot. I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side. depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want. so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds."
7,"This is a good. standard pot holder.  The metal construction is sturdy and it keeps my plant perfectly perched on my wood railing (a plus because some of the non-adjustable holders I've found are meant for a skinnier metal railing and don't work for my situation).  So functionality wise. these have been perfect.  But aesthetically. it still pretty utilitarian looking.  There's really nothing in the way of ornamentation or decoration.  Because of that. I like using this with a pot that is well designed and pretty on it's own.Aesthetics aside. it functions as expected and is perfect for people (like me) whose railings are not a uniform size."
7,"Decent quality though not quite as sturdy as I would have wanted.Good news though. it fits 6' or less rails with an adjustable arm.  My package had all the items included.  Some folks complained the brackets weren't included but I noticed mine were just lying in the bottom of the box separate from the rest of the item.  Perhaps the customer missed them or perhaps the shipper missed them.  Not sure.  But without those it is useless.Holds a 10 inch pot.  Looks nice.  Just wish the metal was a bit better quality.  I worry it might wear. bend. or break over time.  I will update if this occurs."
7,"When I originally set this up on our front porch railing. I was very pleased with the ease of it.  I was able to do it rather quickly and without assistance.  I chose to put a flower pot that has trailing vines in it. that way the frame would be hidden a bit and it looked great.  If I were to rate this item on that alone. it would get 5 stars.  But then I was at our local hardware & garden center and saw similar pot holders for half the price.  I ended up buying two of them in the same 10 inch size top add more pots to our front deck and they were just as easy to install and work just as well.  So for this I do drop this item down to 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong it's a good item. but why pay more than you should? I definitely recommend shopping around if saving money is as important to you as it is to me."
7,"I can't get over how easily this product changes to fit my needs.  I have a wide railed deck railing outside and  narrow railed wrought iron railing around a balcony in my living room inside.  I can switch this within in minutes to fit either railing.I don't know how long it will have to be out in the weather to affect the paint on this. but I tried a sharp knife  and it took a very sharp one and a lot of pressure to even scratch this - but yes it does scratch under a lot of abuse.It is built so that it has a piece in the back that acts a bit like a stabilizer so that the flower pot will not be at to sharp of an angle -water/heavy rain will drain out but the soil will stay inside the pot."
7,"I have this attached to my rails on my back porch.  I just planted a bunch of geraniums(red and white)and put the pot into the holder when I was done.  Very sturdy-that was one thing that I was afraid of was that it was going to fall over. But the brackets are very firm-dont think I will have a problem with them this summer.Nice product. It looks better when you get it. When I saw it on Amazon it looked very cheap but not when you get it.Might buy a couple more to match the one I just got!"
7,"It is flexible. can hold 50+ pounds (lbs). and sit on practically any railing up to 6-inch wide incl. thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets.  You can ignore the manufacturer's claim that the bracket can adjust 2-6 inches.  When using only 1 or 2 bracket's bolts (of 3) closest to the pot's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat (bar) of the L-shaped clasp - the vertical clasp's flat (bar) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches.  It is safe to use just 1 bolt. as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force. which can very little pull (shear away) the bolts. one of which can easily handle.  However. the overall look is less than inspiring."
7,"So this flow pot is adjustable. can attach to deck railing. and will. in fact. hold a flow pot.  So as far as meeting expectations to the letter. sure. it worked out.  It's OK.But actually using it brings up some downsides.  The metal. while strong. when supporting a wide-based pot. seems like it's taxing its available strength to hold the bot up.  Also. depending on the pot. the side rails may be too high or. in my case. far to low to hold a tall pot in a way that looks and feel secure.  Nothing has broken or fallen out. but...I'm just waiting for it to happen.Overall. it's an OK adjustable pot holder. but it doesn't impress me very much and really isn't any better than average."
7,"This is a nice sturdy product but it doesn't work well on my deck railing.  I have a board railing with slats. rather than a thick beam. and the unit just falls off if bumped.  When I move it so it sets against the slat it doesn't lie flat on the top.I can secure it by putting another screw or bolt behind the rail. but it's not supposed to need that. If you plan to order these. get just one first. and make sure it will work for you before buying enough for all your petunias."
7,"No way does this product perform as promised.  And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work!I don't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck.  At the top of the rail. one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat.  Any which way we tried it. it did not hold. would not grip the railing and kept falling forward. The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing.  How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing?  Only if you assemble it OFF the railing; then you can't get it ON the railing.(I think I got all the parts:  I received the basket. two L-shaped arms. six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts.)"
7,"The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired. but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence. and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong. and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason. my set came with four extra metal brackets. and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets. which are metal. like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them. unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around."
7,"This is a wonderfully realized product. Whether mounted over narrow or wide railings. the included brackets configure securely for either wide or narrow installations.The ten-inch option that I acquired has a depth of five and a half inches - eight inch baskets are also available. both in either black or white. The construction is sturdy. The bumper that keeps the holder level against the vertical support of the mounting area is rounded. so that no matter where I install this. I am not at all worried about scuffs. scratches or unsightly indentations.I love CobraCo's Adjustable Flower Pot Holder. This is the perfect item for helping to get another flower pot up and out of the way. It's well-built. it's easy to use and it really livens things up."
7,"We have coyote fences in my neck of the wood which are Latilla wood rods wrapped around an iron post. It's not always easy to find something which will hang easily on the inside of the fence. which is why I was interested to see this planter design. I find it works perfectly although it may be just a tad too flimsy for anything with a substantial weight. That being said. I think it will hold up lighter plants with no problems whatsoever.It looks well built and the adjustable part screwed together nicely. The other nice part about this is that you can move it wherever the sun is and then move it back to a shady place to rest for a while. It's a nice idea and I will recommend it to my neighbors who are always trying to figure out gadgets so they can hang flowers on their coyote fences."
7,"We have all different types of fencing in our yard--split rail. decking and wood fence. The CobraCo flower pot holder accommodates them all.  It has a nifty L-shaped clasp that adjusts two ways to hang from virtually any support--for thinner railings (2-4') and thicker railings (4.5-6').  I was worried this pot holder would be like so many others that tilt forward on an angle when a heavy plant is actually sitting in it.  To my delight. it sits perfectly vertical. thanks to another nice feature. a bumper that hits up against rails and prevents any slant.  This is a generous sized pot holder.  It can fit up to 10' pots. and if weight is an issue. it could also hold a large coco fiber liner instead.  One of my favorite summer pastimes is relocating flower baskets. and this is the perfect gardening companion."
7,"This is a nice. versatile pot holder for any sort of railing.  We live in a townhouse. and each unit has a fenced-in. concrete patio.  There's really no place to plant flowers. so a container garden is an only option.  I didn't want many containers crowding the ground of my small patio. so I opted for hanging them places.This pot holder is exactly what I needed.  It's 10 inches at the top. and will accommodate a range of flower pots.  The fastener is adjustable. to make them useful in a wide variety of locations.  I was able to fit it to our fencing perfectly.  It's sturdy and well-made. and I expect it will last through many cycles of flowers."
7,"This is a no frills Adjustable Flower Pot Holder. but it doesn't really need any frills. There is no fancy ironworks on this one. but it really doesn't need it as long as it works.  I put this on on my 4' railing and it felt secure. I lined mine with the brown liners that come from hardware store so that you just have to put in the dirt and it looks great!  It can hold up to a 10' pot of flowers and that's pretty wide!  All in all. I like it!  This on is Vinyl-coated steel and the longer one the same company makes is Powder-coated steel and feels much more substantial.  Couldn't ask for anything to be different."
7,"First of all this does what it is supposed to and in that it is a fine product.However.Took me awhile to figure out how to get it to work (directions not so clear and not 100% self explanatory)The screws and slides allow for probably most desk rail widths.  But the tricky part is that there is a support on the pot which requires that it be braced against a post or a baluster/picket.  My deck railing has a very old style (and no longer code) style 'X' between posts.  This left very little spacing options for where the pot could be placed.  From below it looks lovely but a direct look at it the two anchors to the railing don't looks so neat (tempted to place a pot on top of them to hide them)."
7,"Over the years I have tried a number of flower pot holders and have always been disappointed with the quality of them. This flower pot holder is made of strong and sturdy steel that is vinyl coated and rust proof so I don't have to worry about rust stains on my deck rails or the holder hanging crooked because of the flower pot weight. It can hold up to 10' flower pots or even several small flower pots so it has great versatility. It was easy to install and looks simple. yet gorgeous. The only thing I didn't like was having to drill my new deck to install the flower pot holder. Overall. it's a great item that's a cut above the rest."
7,"This is a substantial. yet almost invisible pot holder. Come to think of it. though. I have a light pot and plant in it; if I had this attached to a railing on a second story or higher railing. I would think twice about placing a heavy pot in it for fear that it might break and fall. I like it fine on our first floor railing.The nuts to adjust the holder could be better. I would suggest using stainless steel wing nuts--or even plastic with brass thread insert knobs--to replace the acorn nuts. Even with those changes. this is still a reasonably-priced plant pot holder."
7,"This is a simple sturdy product that works.  It is holding a potted Geranium easily on my porch railing.This is easy to put together. When you hang this on a railing the flower pot holder is held securely thanks to two brackets and a bottom overhang.There are three screws on each side of the top of the flower pot holder.  There are two brackets that the screws hold.  On the bottom of the flower pot holder there is a four and a half inch by two and a half inch overhang on the back of the holder. The brackets and the bottom overhang secure the flower pot holder in place.The instructions say this will work on iron. aluminum and wood top railings up to 2 3/4 and wooded 2x4 and 2x6 railings.  It fits up to 10 inch pots.This is sturdy and seems like it is made to last."
7,"I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice. simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it."
7,"Cobra's 10-inch adjustable flower pot works well for those who would like a pot that can mount to their deck or patio railing and hold a pot up to 10-inches in diameter at the top (and 7 inches in diameter at the base). The adjustable railing brackets have screw/bolt combinations that will accommodate railing widths between 2 and 6 inches. The pot is simple to adjust. install. and use. It will accommodate plastic. wood. metal. or clay pots as long as the dimensions are correct. The neutral black color works well anywhere."
7,"On the product label it says this pot holder is 'for decks. balconies and fences'.  The planter has U shaped brackets that are designed to slip over a flat 2x4 or 4x4 or 2x6 railing. but this design doesn't work on a privacy fence.  My fence has no top mounted 2x4 so there is no place to hook the bracket.  I even tried screwing the brackets into the fence's 4x4 post. but the pot's brackets are 4 1/2' apart so that didn't work either.In the end I just hung the pot on the wooden support of glider/swing that I have on the patio.  Not exactly where I wanted the pot holder. but an okay place I guess."
7,"Havahart 1020 - Small rodentsI have a larger Havahart from about 20-25 years ago that works to this day and is able to catch squirrels without any difficulty. The wire mesh on that model is too big for small field mice. so I bought this 1020 to hopefully catch some of these smaller mice and rats. They tend to crawl into my engine compartment and store seeds or other rubbish.The 1020 is quite small and light weight. Its construction isn't very good. everything seems thinner and lighter than the older design. The bait tray is easily sprung. A gust of wind will set it off. and it renders it useless in windy conditions outside. Understandably. a field mouse is going to be quite light so a heavier trap may not spring when the mouse touches the tray. Unfortunately. this also makes the 1020 very touchy. I recommend using it indoors or in a covered area close to the suspected location of the critters.Overall: 4/5 stars. the construction could be better. but time will tell"
7,"I just bought an emergency back-up generator.  It's just like a snow thrower.  It you buy it. you probably will never need it and it becomes another gas-fired device that needs maintenance.  Unfortunately. we need both.  Ocassional power outages and significant snow storms here in Maryland do happen.  Even though we hopefully will never have another 40&#34; monster storm like the one a few winters ago. we do have frequent violent storms enough to justify the generator and I just about wore out my snow thrower on that one storm alone.  I think we're do for more.  Hence the generator cover."
7,"When I was looking for a nice storage box for my front porch -- I ordered this product based on the other reviews.  They were right!  It WAS easy to put together.  Less than 2 minutes. no tools. no kidding.  It's very sturdy and doubles as overflow seating when necessary.  Very handy.  I even went back and ordered the larger one.  One note on the color:  It's more of a light taupe than the whiteish tone you see in the picture.  No matter. I highly recommend it."
7,"It took all of 5 minutes to assemble except for the top. That took about 4 more minutes to figure out. This product literally snaps together - no tools needed except for the top which they claim just snaps on like the other pieces. Maybe if your a body builder you have the strength to bend the tab by hand but I couldn't.There is a simple solution - after sliding the right side hinge into place - use a medium sized flat blade screw-driver inserted between the tab and the hinge and carefully bend the hinge back toward the right and slide the hinge over the tab and your done.I doubt that if left out in a heavy rain-it would be water tight - but that is not an issue for me since I am using it to store ceramic & stainless steel accessories for my Ceramic Egg Grill/Smoker."
7,"We try to keep unused containers stored upside down to prevent standing water that leads to mosquitoes breeding.However. my garden area consists of raised beds and earthboxes around the perimeter.  The earthboxes have reservoirs that hold water and mosquitoes often breed in them. leading to a garden full of mosquitoes.It really helps to drop some Mosquito Bits into the fill tube of each earthbox during the season.  I have a few other large containers that have attached saucers that fill with water.  They get some bits added too.This product works well.  A container lasts for quite awhile and makes it much easier to be in the garden and yard."
7,"For every soil sample I tested this powder with. it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5. which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here. good stuff). and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix). 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester."
7,"Soil from different areas of the yard test a bit differently. and I got repeat results. This would indicate the tests are at least consistent and sensitive enough to be of use. I'm happy to at least have a good idea of the soil and don't have to worry that it is way off. Since a couple of fruit trees were not so hot. I wondered about that. As it turns out. all my areas are a bit acidic. so I amended the soil and hope for good results.What people say about the small capsules is true. Pretty darn tiny and probably very difficult for many people to use without spilling. What would bigger capsules cost?  Nothing probably.Five stars if it would also kill gophers and weeds."
7,"Inexpensive. this kit consists of ten single use tablets.  Instructions are clear and the contents -- a vial. ten test tablets and an eye dropper for water -- are well-designed.  For the price. it provided me peace of mind on my growing conditions and prevented me from pH conditioning the soil where it did not need conditioning.On the downside. readings are not precise.  You'll get a good idea of the general soil pH within a .5 reading. but nothing specific.  That's probably okay. however.  Most times soil conditions are not exact from place to place anyhow and a general idea is what most of us need."
7,"It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap. you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement."
7,"I love this hedge trimmer!  I have a fair number of bushes and hedges that need trimming. but always hated having to trim them mainly becuase of the tools.  I had a corded model (also a B&D;) that cut very well. but the cord was always a real pain -- it always got snagged on something. and I ended up spending more time dealing with the cord than actually trimming. Looked into a gas model. but the weight was an issue. as well as the noise.The cordless B&D; is a fantastic tool! It lets you concentrate on the trimming. Ready to go in a second (no cord to unwind and plug in) and the battery lasts a decent interval. No. it's not an everlasting battery that will run for hours. but that's an easy problem to solve -- just get a second battery so if the first one gives up before you're done. you just pop in another.Nicely balanced and easy to handle. Highly recommend!!"
7,"This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house.  Uses the same 18V battery as my B&D; drill. so it's nice to have a spare if I need it.  First time I used it. I went out planning to spend 5 minutes or so trying it out.  Instead. I was outside over 45 minutes and got most of my trimming done.  I've never used a corded trimmer. but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord.  This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery.  Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment (don't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building). and keep it charged.  If the trimmer doesn't run for long right out of the box. you probably have a defective battery."
7,"I bought the B&D Cordless Hedge trimmer a few weeks ago based on the comments made by the people here in the reviews.  I am very pleased with my purchase. I found the power to be adequate for trimming shrubs around the yard. I didn't find the weight a problem as did some who reviewed it. The safety lock is an inconvenience. As some did. I fixed it to where it would stay in the locked position. It makes a big difference. Time will tell how the batteries will hold up. So far I have no complaints. I would recommend this trimmer"
7,"I love this little blower!  I can grab it at a moment's notice and blow the leaves. pine needles. and other debris out of my courtyard.  SOOO much easier than dragging out the corded electric blower for quick light jobs!  Fits my 'girl hands' nicely. not too heavy. not too noisy. lasts about 15 minutes.  For the big jobs. I'll still get out the 'monster' electric blower that works like a hurricane coming through. but with this little guy I find myself blowing leaves and stuff frequently now. instead of dreading getting out the big one for a small job.  I'm going to look at the other items they make that uses the same battery pack too."
7,"Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one. there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the 'high power' blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry. this little guy gets in between the bush's. shrubs. plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard. saving a few hours of raking."
7,"I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use."
7,"Still works same as when I first bought it.  It's not a high-powered blower. and it will go thru the battery pretty quick. but if you want to just grab a blower to blow off your patio or driveway without dealing with cords or anything this is great.  I've got a ton of concrete around my front and back yards and two batteries does the trick.  If for some reason I want something really high-powered I will pull out the old corded blower. but it's rare.  My common use is blowing off sidewalks after mowing the grass."
7,"Great little machine. For less than 100 bucks you get a trimmer that does a good job. Can be used as an edger also. I don't have large property but I can use this maybe 3 times before charge runs out. They give you two batteries with it and you can always have the backup charged and ready. Why mess with gasoline and mixing oil. Just turn this on and go. Very light weight and easy to manuever. Can adjust the height to suit your needs and no bumbing to advance the string. More convienent than gas or electric and not alot of money."
7,"No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight. strong enough for moderate trimming. and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill. use it. plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord. but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!"
7,"I live in one of those communities that have common grounds which are kept up by a service; as a result. I only have to tend the grounds in and around my house.  I used to have to lug a power cord out to do it.  With this device. though. I can charge it up overnight and then bounce outside for perhaps 3 minutes of effort at the most.  You have not experienced convenience until you've had the luxury of no gas and pullcord startup or long troublesome power cord. just a battery powered tool.  It is definitely not for large estates. but for simple short jobs. it is perfect."
7,"I can not believe that I am using the same animal others have reviewed. I looked on the box to be sure. This is my third year and it is still working as well as the first time I tried it. I have a small lawn and what used to be reachable by mower is now only reachable by trimmer. With all the compost I use and other earthy products. the lawn has risen above the driveway and sidewalk. By using the 'Groom 'N' Edge' button to rotate the trimmer head 180 degrees to convert the trimmer to an edger. I not only groom the lawn but also cut away the overflow dirt. Maybe this is why I seem to use more Black & Decker AF-100 String than the average reviewer. I think this thing will never fall apart; if it does I will go cordless."
7,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use. just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit. or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok. I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
7,"I purchased this trimmer in May 2008 and I am very happy with it.  I have used it about 5 times.  The majority of my weed trimming is done by a yard service. but I needed a trimmer for touch up and weed trimmer in areas outside the lawn.  It is very nice to put in a battery and go.  Battery life is good.  I can get about 20 minutes of hard use (briars. thick weeds) and about 40 minutes of light use (grass) out of a fresh battery.  The unit comes with two batteries.  I have changed the 'string' once and it was easy.  The trimmer is light and quiet. May experience with the cordless trimmer resulted in me purchasing the B&D cordless pole hedge trimmer.  They use the same battery. which is very helpful.  All and all very good product. if you understand your getting a light duty trimmer."
7,"I love B&D; tools and have a variety of 18v tools.  I never really owned many gardening tools and decided to buy this and give it a whirl...no pun intended. :-)  The package comes with 2 18v batteries. a spindle of twine. and the hog it self.  Charged one of the batteries for 18 hours or so and off I went to get rid of weeds.  PERFECT....this worked for about 30 minutes on full power and 15-20 minutes on half power with one full  battery.I was impressed...as the 18v electric broom died in 20 minutes...I have now used it about a dozen times and my results are exactly the same....  Replacement twine is avail on Amazon and  your your local big store... :-)5/5 - Great Product. Great Value...especially for us beginners."
7,"I have a large bay window with a window seat in my kitchen that gets natural light from three sides. In the spring the seat pads get stashed and out comes and insulated mat that covers the surface. this heat mat. and plant tray with fortified planting material for seedlings or plant cuttings. This mat keeps the plant tray warm and encourages rapid growth without doing much more than keeping the plants warm and fed. In a matter of 3-4 days. the plants sprout and show root growth.I like this mat because I get fast and effective results with this every time I use it. It's a good product that pays for itself with its success rate and the fact that it makes me feel like a gardening pro."
7,"This little device worked like a charm starting my seeds last winter. I couldn't believe how much quicker it took for them to germinate when using this mat. I put it on a timer with my lights and found it easy to use and setup. It kept a nice warm temperature. never getting too hot. Hopefully it will last for quite awhile as I only get to use it a few weeks a year.UPDATE - Year 2 -Seed mat is working as designed again this year. I need to get another one as I have doubled the amount of seeds I am growing. Definitely recommend this product."
7,"I have used this to help germinate some cucumbers I started indoors in a small greenhouse tent. At night when the grow lights are unplugged the inside get fairly chilly like the rest of the house. but with this heat mat I can leave it on all night and not have to worry about the seedlings. I would say it keeps the inside temperatures a good 10 degrees warmer than without it. I found the cord to be a little short but it's really no big deal. Before purchasing I compared this with the ones for sale on Gardener's Supply and this seemed to be much better value for the size."
7,"This is our third year growing tomatoes upside down. so to speak.  At first I was dubious. but now we look forward to growing our own tomatoes.  We have one for large roma tomatoes and another for small cherry tomatoes.  We have to grow these up and away from wild turkeys that roam in our neighborhood looking to eat any and all fresh vegetable shoots.  We placed them on an upper deck with a drip system.  For optimal growth we have them hanging up against the house so more heat bounces off the house onto the plants; heat is ideal for growing tomatoes.  We regularly trim and pinch off new growth so that all the energy goes into the tomatoes.Four star:  These are plastic and are only useable for one year.  I have had a couple of the plastic breakdown before the fruit bearing season was over and had to duct tape it back together.  We will keep using these for our particular situation.  We love our fresh tomatoes."
7,"This may look like a gimmick to you but it's not.  This planter can actually grow tomatoes and other vegetables.  All you need is a sunny place to hang it.  If you live in an apartment or otherwise have no garden space. try this.  They call it a tomato planter but it actually should be called a vegetable planter.  Last summer I grew tomatoes. bell peppers and cucumbers in them.  I believe it needs to contain more soil (larger) to be an ideal tomato planter.  It grew lots of tomatoes but peppers and cucumbers did even better.  One trick to know (not applicable for tomatoes)- take the top plastic cover off and plant 2 vegetable plants per topsy turvy-- one in the top and one in the bottom."
7,"Especially with cherry and grape sized tomatoes. Amazing production. it's out of the way. well-engineered. they even include a nice big metal hook to hang it with! The plastic-fabric sides WILL disintegrate in a couple-three years. so don't expect this to be a lifetime purchase. But it works great. you'll have more tomatoes than you'll know what to do with! I ordered two of these to replace the single one I had bought a couple years ago. Very clever idea. highly recommended! HINT: don't use cheap potting soil!"
7,"I am a Master Gardener. which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours.  We can't teach old wive's tales. just scientifically proven plant info (but some of the old wive's tales have been proven. so they are O.K. :-) ). These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness.  They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants.  I am giving two stars for the novelty factor. but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down"
7,"This does exactly as advertised. The Black Russian Truffle Tomato i put in mine was growing famously. Actually. it's growth was fairly unprecedented. until....the whole thing fell and the plant's main stem was crushed. See. when the planter is watered properly. it is also incredibly heavy for its size. So. the lesson there would be to make sure whatever you hang it from can hold quite a bit of weight. I would say it needs to be able to hold at least twenty pounds. since the total weight of a fully grown plant with the planter and all the requisite soil and watering will at least end up weighing this much. It might be safer to shoot for 30 pounds though. However. that was a user error problem on my part for not planning properly. The planter itself is great. You cant overwater. as any excess will simply run out the bottom. A good solid and inexpensive purchase."
7,"Bought two after watching neighbor's do fairly well except for watering neglect.This year will have her hang closer to our yard so we can keep eye on it.These two. when set. will be accessible to daily watering as needed.  It doesn't look to be any 'foam ring' in these 2.  BUT one can always stir 'foam packing peanuts' into dirt/potting mixture. which will create some lightness to over all hanging weight. as well as help with water retention.As to Fabric rotting/giving out after one season vs the earlier reviews. Sounds like the typical of past 4 yrs of IMPORTED product where the MFG has reduced the quality of the fabric."
7,"This product works as advertised. my tomatoes are doing very well.  However. it is VERY heavy when filled with dirt and watered.  You need a sturdy hook and place to hang it.  I was having problems with it drying out quickly (granted. I live in New Mexico. where it is quite dry) even though I had added water absorbing crystals to the soil.  I ended up removing the top 6 inches of soil and placing a plastic milk jug in the top.  I punched some holes in the bottom of the jug and I fill this with water nearly every day.  The water then slowly seeps in to the soil instead of running out the bottom. dripping is reduced and the plant gets the water it needs.  I would give it five stars if some system were in place to keep it from dripping so I could use it indoors and if it were a little easier to plant."
7,"This is the second 4 foot hydrofarm grow light ive purchased.  I bought one last year and then again one this year. (The first one still works great)  I use the grow light for my seed starter kits and noticed that the seedlings directly under the light grow alot stronger and healthier than the ones on the outside edges.  So thats where the 2nd light purchase came in.Having the lights hang from the adjustable strings is a pretty nice feature.  As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string.The only thing i would change about this light that would make it better would be if it had 2 bulbs so it covers more area."
7,"I've been using this to keep plants alive during the frost. I didn't think they could grow anymore because of the cold. This thing makes them grow! I was surprised. The plants went from about 12 inches tall to about 18 inches. I keep the light on for about 16 hours a day. and if it's warm enough outside I put them out there on a roller.My only con is that the frame could be built better. other than that it's great if you have a few plants you need to keep alive during the winter. It's good even if you want to start plants."
7,"I have a small greenhouse and I'm using this Grow Light to keep my vegetables going. It provides light in Winter to 5 Earthboxes full of vegetables. Does it work? I have 5 planters full of vegetables. some blooming getting ready to fruit. and some squash and cucumbers with fruit on them. and there is ice and snow on the ground outside. very little natural light this time of year.It seems flimsy. and you wouldn't want to kick it around or place it somewhere with lots of traffic and people bumping into it. Otherwise. I haven't a problem with the fact that it isn't SOLID. I move it around a little every day or two to make sure everything is getting some light. It handles that just fine.I'm thinking of getting another one or two. If it wasn't so expensive. I would. I haven't found anything I like better."
7,"As you can see. most of these reviews are very old.  I have one and it is very sturdy and designed quite well. The lifting mechanism works great and is a great improvement over most of the more inexpensive systems that require moving each side separately.  I would definitely recommend this system - its a nice dark forest green and the paint job is excellent - you could put it in the living room and it would look just fine.  I can't comment on shipping and packing as I bought mine at a retail store but I would have to say the package itself seems pretty well packed so if anything breaks I would say the retailer you bought it from did not protect it well enough in the shipping box.  It is. afterall. a lightbulb and should be shipped as such. with plenty of pellets."
7,"When I retired. I wanted to retire my home made pvc light stand.  Mind you. there was nothing wrong with it.  Having said that. these light systems by Hydrofarm are fantastic.  I have four of them and used them all winter.  Packaging and instructions were right on and they are absolutely wonderful. I wondered at the system for raising the light up and down because it seemed so simple.  Well. simple and smooth it is.  It raises and lowers the lights in micro inches if you want. In this way you can raise them as the plants grow and it seems not to wear out at all with one season behind them.  I wish I had done this way before I retired."
7,"Unlike some other reviewers. I find the build quality satisfactory. It is a little small for potted plants. however. When raised to the highest position. the lamp has a 26' clearance to the ground. The high-efficiency bulb generates a little less heat than standard fluorescent lights but is still hot enough to scorch leaves that come too close. In short. the maximum height for the plants is around 24'. sufficient for a seed starter but way too low to serve as a mini-green house for plants that need to winter indoors."
7,"I am very impressed with this unit!  I was able to start most of my seeds indoors this year and the ability to raise and lower the light easily to make sure you don't end up with spindly plants is great.  The light does not put out massive amounts of heat at all and is *incredibly* bright!  What amazing technology.  Highly recommend if you are a gardener who lives in an area with a short growing season.  The unit is extremely portable and lightweight.  It is also so simple to put together almost anyone could do it.  I prefer putting it on a table for easier access to plants and I also bought an inexpensive timer so I wouldn't have to remember to turn the unit on and off while working.  Great value."
7,"This is very heavily built and well designed.  For a compact grill it reaches cooking temperature rapidly. and can hold 6 large burgers easily.  You can adjust the grill height to two positions. So far I've found the high position cooks best for my own style of cooking.  It's is easy to clean (set it on the grass and hose it out).  The bottom grating is showing signs of rust. so I've started using WD-40 on it after I rinse it out.  However. it is so stout that I don't know that the slight rust would cause a problem for some time."
7,"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together. but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it. but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top. and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it. then after cook marshmallows.  Food. Friends & Drink!  Life is good......"
7,"For starters. there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front. seems intuitive. but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow. but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it. but. so far. we're not doing well."
7,"After all. it IS cast iron.  It should last a lifetime.  It was very easy to put together. and we expect to use it for making kabobs on these warm summer days.  I think it took all of about 4 minutes to put it together.  There were no instructions and none were needed.We already have a charcoal grill. but sometimes you want just to cook enough for say two people and that's it. with no left overs.  This will do the job very nicely and not use a lot of charcoal.Oh. they recommend you place it on a concrete patio block to protect any surfaces underneath the grill.  The legs will get pretty hot. and the concrete block will absorb most of that. and not allow for any charring to take place under the unit.  You will need to have protective gloves on to handle the draft vents."
7,"The Lodge Logic L410 Sportsman grill is wonderful. I received this as a Father's Day gift and put it to work. 28 briquettes and cooked 4 1/3Lb burgers and 4 jumbo hotdogs to perfection. 1' thick steaks cooked perfectly. Easy to assemble and clean.  Took a lightly oiled cloth to clean out any residual ash once it cooled. Stores nicely. I will mention it is heavy so be careful. It is cast iron and therefor weights a bit. Others have concerns about the tabs breaking off the door. but if you are moving it that much remove the door to move the grill."
7,"I sure do love having this set in my shed.  I've used the blower extensively and the weed-whacker extensively.  I've never used the hedge trimmer. so I can't comment on that.Some perks..* it comes with two rechargeable batteries. which is super handy for heavy work days.  The battery charger also holds/chargers both batteries at the same time. Bonus.* Lightweight.  I never felt worn out carrying any of these around the lawn.* A wall mount with hooks comes with the set. So. I was able to hang these all neatly in my shed. just like in the photo.* Durable. good B&D; quality.The only bummer I've found with this set is that the leaf blower sucks the life out of the rechargeable batteries rather quickly.  So. don't dawdle when using the leaf blower."
7,"I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient.  After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping. we just felt that it didn't cut it.  We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so (the saving grace was that there were 3 of them. so there was always another one ready to go--so long as you were using one machine at a time).  Also. I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes.  The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges.  The blower blows grass around--do not even think about using it on leaves.  I cannot speak for the weedwacker. as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it."
7,"The easiest way to go.. March 10. 2008By  P. Stein 'Bengals Fan' (Beavercreek. OH) - See all my reviewsI previously purchased all three items separately. The broom works great on my outdoor carpet. and is much easier to use than a wet dry vac. Easily blows away lawn clippings. The hedge saw is much easier to use than my electric hedge saw. though not as powerful. Fair tradeoff. The trimmer works fine. Preferable to either gas or electric. though obviously less powerful. Again. a fair tradeoff. If you have to stop and recharge it. no big deal. I received a promotional radio/charger free. I just keep the battery in the radio charger. and it's always ready to use. Great for when you use a portable radio all day. Recommend you try to add the radio to your arsenal. I'm glad I purchased these items. It made my life easier."
7,"First of all. this is a light duty set of tools.  If you've got a large lawn and garden to take care of. I think you'll be happier with a corded approach to electrical tools.  But I've found this perfect for my needs.  Each battery is perfectly capable of powering the blower for five minutes or so. and since you have three batteries you can clear quite a large area.  The clipper and trimmer are top notch and seem to run forever on one battery.  The blower is about half as powerful as the best corded models. but it's adequate for blowing junk over hard surfaces."
7,"I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues.  I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy. are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years. and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand.  They operate very smoothly. they lock very smoothly. much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used.  And they work!  I can cut through some thick branches with ease. despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner."
7,"I haven't owned these long enough to know how they will stand the test of time. but they seem very well made. have a sharp blade. are comfortable. and have smooth action.  I like that you can swap out the blade after you've sharpened it too many times.  Mine came with a tiny tool that can be used to take apart the pruners. replace the blade. etc.  Seems like something that will be lost instantly.  Would have appreciated it if they had designed this to store on the pruner body somehow.  Also. the aluminum is roughed up a bit towards the tip of the pruner.  I am assuming this is part of manufacturing process but it looks more like someone drug it on the concrete or something.  The rest of the tool is finished nicely."
7,"The most used garden tool is the pruners.  Cutting your plants back. you should make a clean cut as to not stunt their growth.  Again as things like small branches and trees grow you have to prune them back so this tool works great.  I work HVAC and always have a branch up my butt and love these to cut back plants around the condenser.  Buy it you'll love them.  As what people said about rust. these are make of steel and they do get a little rust but nothing big.  Stainless is a soft metal and would not work."
7,"My mom owns a garden design and maintenance business.  I never really took interest in it until my wife and I purchased our first home.  As expected. we are now avid gardeners and landscapers.I really like Fiskars and had a set of them along with a cheap set from Target on hand.  My mom recommended that we step up to Felco Pruners.  She noted how she's had her set for over a decade and either takes them in for sharpening or orders new blades. They are built for life.I keep mine in my house with my nice knives.The motion is fluid and exact.  The cut is fine and thorough.  The ergonomics are spot-on.  I cannot find a weak point or complaint.  Be sure to buy the leather belt holster as well.Felco is a Swiss company that specializes in one thing for over 60 years - cutting tools.I wish I bought these sooner."
7,"This is a high quality food grade DE and is labeled as such .  Believe it is the finest powder I have ever purchased and is rated the purest I have found .  My wife and I use it internally. plus I use it on the yard. under my home. garden and my large dog pens .  It works well in my Dustin Miser (sold on Amazon) . producing a very fine cloud of DE dust .  Because it is a very fine powder it coats things well and kills ticks. fleas. Colorado potato bug larva. most ants. and even most hard shell pests . People don't think DE will kill hard shell pests but even they have connecting membranes between the hard shell parts. and legs that can be damaged or cut . This product was shipped FAST and I highly recommend it and this seller to anyone ."
7,"I could not find food-grade diatomaceous earth anywhere locally. Most places had no idea what I was even talking about. I have a relative who lives in a low-income building that has repeatedly been infested with bed bugs. Although they have had professional pest control in several times. they always seem to survive. Tenants are forbidden to use any poisons due to their many tenants with health problems. This diatomaceous earth seems to have solved his problem in his apartment and he's now sharing the secret with his neighbors!This product was a good price; several dollars cheaper than similar products. Shipping was also more reasonable than others. And service was fast-it arrived in little over a week. I will buy from this seller again. should the need arise."
7,"I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned. the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times. I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though. I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!"
7,"[Update June 11. 2012: I'm still using the Bayou cooker several times a week]I bought this for two reasons:1) If it's hot out. I'd rather not heat up the house.2) I can't stand frying indoors.  I don't like the odors and I don't want oil/grease in the house.  We don't have a big outdoor vented hood in the kitchen.  Now I'm able to fry outdoors much of the year.It's a very simple unit.It's light-weight and very portable.  The propane tank weighs far more that the cooker.I use the cooker for wok cooking.  Although I have a very good gas kitchen stove. none of the burners give off nearly as much heat as this Bayou cooker.  At full blast. the Bayou cooker makes a whooshing sound like the gas units used in Chinese restaurants.The reason why I rated it 5 stars is price per performance.  I'm not comparing this unit to more expensive units."
7,"I bought a stove top smoker a few years ago and although I do not use it everyday. I do tend to use it quite often. The problem is that I cannot find the fine wood chips at the regular stores like Wal-mart or Target. These store usually have the really large chips or blocks but not the fine dust like chips one needs for this type of smoker. I have looked at other online stores and found the chips but they were more expensive than at Amazon. What I also like is that this particular pack of chips has an assortment for using with various different meats such as for smoking fish. pork chops. etc. Also. since the smoker I have is a Cameron brand. this is perfect. I especially like the alder for Salmon."
7,"I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible. then again it's brand new. and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple. once. too. I can see ordering a second 25' length. since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard."
7,"There were forest fires around us last summer and I had a couple of these around.  I set them up to water out in the fields around us.  They worked so well that I bought 6 more just for this purpose.  As I am driving around my area; I see that I am not the only one who uses them.  They are sturdy. don't leak for the most part and the sprinkler head is of decent quality.  Unlike some other tripods. the sprinkler can be replaced with another if needed.  They will fall over if you have a decent windy day.  So. you should check on them occasionally."
7,"I had used rockwool. but after reading some reviews thought I'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool. Rockwool can easily get drenched. but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake. Even the spongy feel made me think &#34;This must be delicious&#34;. I never caved into that temptation. but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies. I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the &#34;Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat.&#34; which is convenient."
7,"I have had mine for 3 years now and love it. The assembly is minimal and the seasoning prcedure makes all the parts stay in great shape. I do a fair amount of smoking of meats (weekly) and it has been performing well. I have not modified it and manage the internal heat by using the right amount of charcoal and monitoring the unit every 20-30 minutes. Having worked with experienced Pit Masters. they all say the same thing. You have to pay attention to your fire. lift the lid as little as possible. monitor the temp. add more as needed. The only downside. true for all the water-smokers (hence 4 instead of 5) is adding can be challenging but not impossible. Patience is required. Would I buy it again. yes. Most of my smoking is done between 200-225F. and it does from ribs and whole turkeys very well. Even smoked a meatloaf! MMMMMMMMMM"
7,"This is a great hatchet that Paul would have liked to have had in his wood choppers tool box. There was a heavy storm in these parts fairly recently with very strong winds that knocked down many trees. Two of my neighbors trees fell into my yard and tore up my cedar fence. I also had my largest hardwood tree get blown over in my backyard where it fell without causing any damage. I sure wish Paul was available to help me out. Instead of Paul. this Fiskars hatchet came to the rescue in helping to clear up this big mess. Yes. I had to use a chainsaw as well when it came to cutting up the tree trunks. But the hatchet made short work of chopping up a lot of the branches. The hatchet has a nice heft and a comfortable grip. The blade stayed sharp far longer than I had anticipated. This is a must have tool to keep at hand. A great tool and a great price..."
7,"I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else. and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed. which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool."
7,"I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger  pruners.then moved to gardening Fiskars etc. Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house& my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe.then he had to cut some &#34;splinters&#34; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight.extremely sharp.easy to maneuver.and once again.Fiskars.still made in Sweden(maybe Finland)produces far superior results.Top quality.lifetime guarantee.great addition.Can't find a fault.including a very fair price."
7,"You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product. and no. I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle. the look. the design. the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh. Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed. but I did not return it to the vendor. too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them."
7,"I at first was disappointed with the item when I pulled it out of the box as it is VERY light. But don't let that fool you: this trowel is very strong and perfect for loosing up weeds (in between flagstone or in gravel). mild digging (2-4&#34; rocks) and full potting. I am going to buy another for my Grandma as this item is so light it will be perfect for her. I imagine it cannot handle excessive force. but given it's weight it is pound-for-pound as strong if not stronger than a metal or other material counterpart. PLUS it can't rust. which is great for me since I live near the ocean."
7,"Seems like every other week or so it randomly drops to 84 cents as an add on item. You simply cannot beat that price. I got several for my son and his friends to play with in the dirt and some for the front and back yard. It is a ridged plastic but dug fine in hard dirt for me. Don't go prying up rocks or it might break but for general digging it is just fine. But you can abuse it all you want and if it does break you are out less than $1."
7,"While not as strong as a trowel made of metal. Fiskars 7978 Composite Trowel is still strong enough to handle basic gardening tasks.  Made out of a composite plastic called `FiberComp'. the tool is very lightweight.  The blade is oversized. quite wide. and appears to be quite sturdy.  The rock solid handle is probably the strongest part of the tool. and snapping the blade off would take a great deal of force.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if not abused. it should last for a long while.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
7,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal. but it's stronger than you might expect. and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp'. tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid. and while much thinner. the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft. it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if used properly and not abused. it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
7,"I get no joy out of killing them. but the voles have driven me to this. Nothing has worked. not the castor oil. the bleach. the ammonia. the commercial pest deterrents.  or the dish detergent. This week I set up traps. some the old fashioned wooden types and one of these Snap-E traps.I've only caught one vole; it was with the Snap-E within hours of setting it. Set up is simple. no tricky bar to set. Filled the bait cylinder with peanut butter and pulled back the metal bar until it clicked into place. Removing the dead vole was easy too. Wearing gloves I lifted up the bar so the vole could drop to the ground. I buried it right there.It's an unpleasant business. but the Snap-E trap is efficient and effective.Update - I've caught two more voles with this same trap. Removing the vole is so much better with this trap than with the wooden one."
7,"But not mine. It has managed to set off one of 3 I have set up. but it avoided getting caught. just as it has for 3 wooden d-Con traps. When I got these I was very optimistic because the bait is actually hidden and the mouse would have to investigate the smell and put its hand on the trap releases to get a better look at the food. Nothing seems to trick this mouse. I don't know what to do. It's been 2 weeks since I set up these traps.Does anyone have any food suggestions to bait with? I've tried peanut butter. walnuts and ranch dressing."
7,"I have an old mallow bush that has had a white fly infestation every year beginning in the spring and running into November.  It is the only place in my yard where whiteflies have been a problem. Because the honey bees love the mallow flowers. I have not wanted to use a systemic or spray with harsh chemicals so the white flies have been right at home there for ten years or so.  In early March this year I placed about a half bag of earthworm castings on the ground under the mallow. spreading them several feet on all sides of the bush.  To my delight and surprise - no white flies on the mallow or surrounding area this year. They've moved away from my yard.  The honey bees are not at all turned off by the castings and continue to enjoy the flowers.  Now that I've seen how well they work. I will never again be without a supply of earthworm castings.  I can't believe I didn't know about their benefits earlier in my gardening adventures."
7,"We've been inundated by squirrels raiding (taking over) our platform birdfeeder that came with our country home.  After extensive searching and reading of consumer reviews. we decided on the Heritage Farms bird feeder.  It looked extremely durable and it holds a lot of seed.  The perches are weight adjustable so you can exclude blue jays or pigeons from eating the seed if you want.  I had the feeder set up in no time and it took about 1 hour before the first bird lighted on it and started eating.  Soon. the word was out and several birds were enjoying the seed.  We look forward to many years of enjoyment - it's built like a 50's metal toy truck. if you're old enough to remember!!"
7,"This has been my best 'Squirrel Proof' Feeder to date and I now have six various kinds of feeders meant to keep out the 'grey hoards'.  When filled with mixed seed it also attracts the greatest variety of birds of any feeder I own. particularly Eastern Cardinals. Is VERY heavy when fully loaded and I found that hanging it is more secure than using the included pole. You MUST use a long and sturdy hanger to keep squirrels from hanging onto a branch or tree trunk and bypassing the weight triggered closing mechanism. Will keep out at least 90% of your Squirrels which usually content themselves to forage on seeds dropping to the ground below the feeder."
7,"I purchased one of these last year and used it this spring for tomato and pepper seedlings.  The ease of use and amount of light provided by this item was amazing compared to an old plant light I'd purchased many years ago.I just ordered a second one and will give my old light to a friend.Since I had a lot of seedlings. I draped a mylar sheet over the entire thing and it reflected the light wonderfully.I really like how easy it is to adjust the height.  My old light only has 3 static levels and you have to maneuver the entire light fixture on the arms from one setting to another.I've already purchased 4 bulbs and expect the two lights to serve me for many years to come."
7,"I had always just used a regular lamp and a south facing window. And only had limited and some what pathetic results despite years of trying. I finally decided to stop messing around. Put this on my Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy to get it. Combined with a seedling heat mat under my seedlings I am seeing faster and healthier growth in all of the seeds I planted. Many of those only sprout in full sun. and I do not think any of them would have come up without this lamp. Very excited. and have just ordered another one!"
7,"This a very good tool and cuts very nicely. I agree that it does a nice job cutting. however. I give it 4 stars because the handles are a bit weak looking and flex easily when trying to cut live branches that approach 3 inches. and I am afraid I will snap the handle if I put too much pressure. That happens when the handles are fully extended or not...so 4 stars. With that said. it works as advertised. It can be locked closed. Be careful and it should get the job done relatively easily. I just wish the handles were sturdier."
7,"The Perky Pet 203 CP is difficult to fill and clean since the only opening is the diameter of a soft drink bottle.  Perky Pet makes other models which open on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end.  That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap). to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.  This model also lacks and included hook for hanging.I have and far prefer the Perky PetPerky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feederwhich has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.  It comes with a small 'S-Hook' for hanging. too."
7,"I have had several feeders that leak or the hummers don't like it including the Aspects 153 & 367 models.  I admit the Aspect model are easier to clean but if the birds don't care for it...  I live in Florida where hummers at my location are not large as in Texas and Cal.  So the size is better for refilling here.  Bees are not a problem here  and the yellow bee guards do not draw them to the feeder.  In fact. I cut small hole in the guards so the hummers could feed easier and also I liked the contrast of yellow because I could have taken them off completely. As for the color you could paint them with hobby shop paint or just nail polish.  Anyhow. I like it and the birds like it what else do you need."
7,"I hadn't put out a feeder for several years. but a little green hummer kept bopping over the the patio this past week whenever I was outside.  He'd hover and dart around the chimes and lights. making it obvious that he was looking for a feeder.So ... I ordered two of these because I wanted some that were small. affordable and had a bee guard.Thanks to Amazon. they arrived very fast and my little hummingbird has already found it.He's happy and I'm no longer feeling guilty.These are easy to fill and just the size I wanted."
7,"This is a good Hummingbird feeder. but once you start feeding Hummingbirds. this is way tosmall.Once the  Hummingbirds started coming to the feeder. I had to refill this at least 3 times aday.I then bought the BIG large feeder. and had to fill it everyday.Please do NOT buy the colored hummingbird food. The Red Dye is Unhealthy-poison to the Hummingbirds.The red yellow feeder and sugar attracts the hummingbirds not the red dye.Your can mix your own hummingbird food using :1 cup white sugar. too . 2 Cups hot. or warm water to melt the sugar.Stir very good till all the sugar is melted.. It should be a bit thick.Do not give it to the birds till it cools down.Do not be discouraged if it takes a few weeks before the hummingbirds find your feeder.I could only give this a 3 star for the small size."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
7,"I purchased one of these feeders in the spring. along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it. this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles. while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here. it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous. but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad. and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days. so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure. but the birds sure like them."
7,"We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works."
7,"The old glass Perky Pet nectar feeder that still have is from the late 1980's or early 1990's.Hope this new &#34;Perky Pet Glass Nectar Feeder&#34; will last as long as that old feeder is lasting!With the construction being very similar i think it might. Differences being:new style has perches & new style has a threaded top & plastic cap where the old style did not have perches & it has a rubber cap & a grove in the top of bottle for a wire to hold the cap onto the bottle.The bee guards on the new feeder really do keep the bees out.If Looking for a glass nectar feeder that the hummers would like;this one by Perky Pet would be an excellent choice!"
7,"Buzz. my Anna's male hummer who has claimed my yard and this feederas his own. seems to like this feeder.  I have two now. I rotate them each weekas I clean. refresh them.  They are a bit hard to clean. I use a toothbrush to cleanthe feeder part.  The newer one is a bit different than the one I got a couple years ago.the perches don't seem as good. seem a bit short. but. it works so far.  Price is rightanyway. especially if you only have one or two hummers that use it."
7,"Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away. Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked. Since then. the other three started leaking also. Don't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months. but I am going to try. I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years. Somebody 'improved' them.Update: I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever. Havn't received them yet. so I don't know how these will perform."
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup. which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers. this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much."
7,"This feeder is very easy to clean and to fill.  Lots of feeding stations.  There are perches all around. and the hummingbirds appreciate this.  Since there is no container above the feeding stations. you can see the birds from all angles. a big plus.  This would be a 5 star product if the design was modified a bit.  If the feeder was a bit smaller in circumference and a little deeper. it could still hold 16 ounces of nectar with slower evaporation and a little more stability when hanging.  This is a good. functional feeder that's reasonably priced."
7,"This thing is great! If I remember. I'll upload some pics. Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy. and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be. which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now. and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue. it's great! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1' feeder."
7,"When filled this is a very heavy bird feeder so be prepared with a steel hook on a post. I doubt that your going to be able to tree limb mount this due to its weight combined with the narrow space between the roof finial and the underside of the handle. But it is a lovely. well constructed. metal bird feeder with a weight sensitive perch. The squirrels can still eat anything that falls on the ground but between the slippery metal and that perch they won't be stealing from inside. And the lid comes off easily while still being able to fill and secure. The bright red color means you can easily spot it outside. This holds a couple pounds of bird seed."
7,"An extremely well constructed feeder. easy for owner to fill. but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed. Owing in part I'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into (either opening or chewing through) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want. The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into. The simple. wide opening (but securely fastening) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders. christina & bogie"
7,"There are many things you notice right off on this feeder.  It is all metal. very attractive and built very well.I am impressed!!I loaded it up with bird seed and within 2 days the birds adjusted to it and actively feeding.  As you can see by the picture there are clever designed 'windows' so you can easily see the amount of remaining seed.Included is the heavy hangar and again clever designed mounting system with screws so you have options on how and where you place it.  I do have it mounted under cover. but it appears to be water proof with its tin roof and painted body. I wouldn't hesitate to put it out in the rain.This would make a great gift for yourself or for someone else."
7,"I can't complain about the squirrels because I put out peanuts and corn for them so I am inviting them into the yard. But they seem content to eat corn and peanuts. They don't bother my other feeders. They are like little monkeys in the yard. I like to watch the squirrels. However this feeder still seemed like a good idea.I have had it up for a few weeks. I have black oil sunflower seeds in it. The birds hit it regularly.It looks great and seems quite durable. I have mine hung from a garden hook."
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
7,"I love my wild animals. especially birds!  I have several bird feeders and love to attract as many birds and variety of birds as possible.  My one or two problems are squirrels and big black birds.  I was thrilled to see this adorable Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird Feeder. It is just so cute...just like a little red barn with a weather vane on top.  It is also very well constructed.  It is working great at keeping the squirrels out of the bird feed.  My squirrels can empty a feeder in just a little bit. but not this one.  I love watching them try and try to get food out of it.  I don't want to hurt the squirrels as my husband suggested using a BB Gun on them so I am just so happy that they will not be harmed. but also can't clean out the feeders.  5 stars!"
7,"This feeder will most certainly light up any back or front yard. it is THAT pretty.  The paint is a solid and thick laquer. and I like the metal perching bar instead of wooden dowels which can get chewed away by annoyed squirrels over time.  The feeder has a large solid hanger and also comes with pole mount.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the filling access.  This feeder top loads. and in order to open the roof piece one must turn the squirrel weather vane.  Opening the roof is easy. but closing it again requires some finesse and delicate realigning of the inside lock.  One needs to be able to look inside to get it realigned. so mounting the feeder on a high pole as we like to do is out of the question.  If the company can figure out an easier way to lock the roof this will be a solid five star feeder."
7,"The Perky-Pet 338 Squirrel Be Gone II Country House is cute.But it's flimsier than it looks from the photos. The construction is thin sheet metal. with sharp edges.I don't know why there are so many positive reviews. It's a less effective feeder than cheaper options (i.e.. the birds don't like it -- at least our birds in the midatlantic). and my squirrels have been able to get out the seed. Meanwhile. the seed has a tendency to get stuck with the awkward portals and under the levers.The feeder can be hung from the metal hanger (which is shown in the photos). or it has a large shaft through the middle. so you can stick it on a pole.The weathervane also serves as the latch to open the top. but it's also poorly engineered."
7,"Squirrels seem to give up very quickly on this feeder. as their weight closes off access to the feeder tray.  While that is a great. money-saving aspect of the feeder. and I really like the large size (fewer refills) and level-check windows. the downside of this type of feeder is that it limits visits from beautiful larger birds (woodpeckers. cardinals. blue jays. etc.  Finches. sparrows. and wrens seems to only visitors due to the small landing area it offers."
7,"It is nicely constructed. It is made of metal. so it will hold up. The perch is weight triggered so larger animals like squirrels will lower the perch and block the food. You can also adjust it dependent on the size of the birds in the area. You can adjust it for larger or smaller birds. It is larger than I expected and will hold plenty of food. If you twist the Weathervane. it will unlock the the panel on the top for easy access for refilling. It also comes with an attachment (including fasteners) that you can place on a stand and you can place the feeder on the stand. easy to place and remove from stand. Over all this is a nice feeder."
7,"This is a good sized feeder and it looks good in the yard.  It seems to be a favorite for the smaller birds.  I've had it in the yard for a couple of weeks now and the squirrels have so far ignored it.  Be careful when you are handling this feeder because the edges on it are very very sharp so use care when taking it out of the box.Updated review several months later:  The feeder has been out in the yard for several months now and it still looks good.  However. the squirrels have now discovered that can climb onto the top of the feeder. unscrew the latch. push it off and then they climb inside and have a picnic.  So I will have to come up with a way to make it so that they cannot unscrew the latch."
7,"Said to be drinking safe. this cute little 4 ft hose is perfect for me as a split-off from the main faucet where I have the big hose. On a hot day I like to drink the really cold well water which comes out after garden-watering. The connections are tight. I always put a bit of Vaseline on washers at the beginning of the season. OR replace them with new rubber ones. I do this on sprayers as well. Maybe that's why I had no leakage problems."
7,"This is a good quality water hose that is safe to drink from.I keep a bowl of water outside my workshop door so the dogs can drink whilst they are out with me. I was always wary that water sat in the regular garden hose could have leeched chemicals. and I would be tainting the water of my four legged friends. I now use this hose instead.  Piece of mind. for just a few bucks.Some reviewers appear to have been shipped hoses without the rubber washer. If you dont use a washer. then it will leak. Mine came with the washer and does not leak. The washers wear out over time and need replacing. I keep these on hand:Gilmour 01RW Rubber Hose Washers"
7,"I have a spout in my garage that sits about two feet off the floor. So I needed a short length hose to use for filling up buckets. watering can. etc. This fit the bill perfectly. Install was a breeze and it is well made. so it should last for a long time. The only draw back for me was that the hose is way to stiff. It sits in a curled up position and always retains back to that position no matter what I try to do to remedy it. Overall not a deal breaker for me as it has exceeded my expectations."
7,"Bought two of these to try to deal with mosquitos that sneak into the house.  Have caught quite a few small flies and gnats. too.  Ordered an extra pack of glue strips.  Be careful to slide the strip in properly and it will be catching flying pests right away.Nice that these are for inside use but an on/off switch would be a good addition.  To turn off. you have to take out of wall socket.  Since the light is pretty bright. I only put them on at night when we leave the rooms or if we are going to be gone for most of the day.A variation that might also work would be a model that could be plugged in but then attached higher up on a wall where the glare of the light would not be in human sight all the time.  Like the large units you see in commercial buildings but scaled down for residential use."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
7,"This Fly Web Fly Trap is actually much larger than expected and did work somewhat to help control my fruit fly infestation. We tried three products side by out of desperation and here are the results after 48 hours:Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap; used as directed. caught 2 fruit fliesFly Web Fly Trap; large plug in light based trap with sticky pads. caught 11 fruit fliesFly Paper Strips. Fly Catcher Trap. Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack; the old standby. not attractive but effective. caught at least 32 (perhaps more)The Fly Web product performed right in the middle of the other two products we tried. but no telling how many it would have caught if it was the only product we used at that time.

7,"I have tried and tried to fild a product that would get rid of those pesky knats!! and fruit flies around the house. and I must say I HIGHLY recommend this product. and is the only thing that has worked well thus far. I keep this running day and night and you would not believe the amount of knats and fruit flies this thing catches!! You better buy more sticky pads. because this thing will sure get filled up quickly. This product receives an easy 5 star rating form me."
7,"Some seasons. I get a lot of small flying insects in the house. mainly because I like to operate my whole house fan.  The main offenders are gnats and small mosquitos that get through the bug screen on my windows.  This unit is great because no matter how small. these bugs will stick to the glue strip.  I bought a spare bulb and spare glue sheets jsut to have them on hand.My only wish is that the unit would add a power switch.  I only operate it at night (makes a good night light in the hallway!) and must physically unplug it and set it down to turn it off.  Either that or a darkness-sensing switch."
7,"This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue. Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap. These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light. Once they are on the glue board they are stuck. period._Bottom Line_ Yes. I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats!"
7,"These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear. this is not a standalone product. they are designed to be used in the 'Fly Web Fly Trap'.The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the 'Fly Web Fly Trap' verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips. Fly Catcher Trap.

7,"I feed birds all winter and the sparrows. cardinals. finches. etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink. as well as. eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter."
7,"Bought this in the summer (much cheaper then) and put it out about 2 months ago.  We have our own 'homemade' fountain which consists of a large pot that holds about 10 gallons of water and a shallow dish on top.This product is able to keep the water liquid. combined with the moving water from the fountain.  Night time temps have averaging about 15 F.  The birds have been flocking to it.The cord is very. very short. about a foot long.  That is one drawback because you will need an outdoor extension cord. It is sturdy and does not get too warm.  You can easily pick it up with your bare hands when it is running.Did not notice the impact on the electric bill."
7,"this is well built and serves it's purpose functionally.my complaint is that the hole inside the shutoff valve/bearing is considerably smaller than the width of the hose connection.  when putting this on. you are basically blocking off around half of the capacity of whatever is after it in the chain.i use it at the end of my hose. right before my gilmour quick connects. so that when i change out my sprinklers and nozzles. i don't have to walk across the yard to turn off the hose so that i don't get sprayed (so lazy).  it works fine. and i haven't seen any real loss of range with the water. but i think the change would be noticeable if i put another hose after this connector."
7,"I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house. and I love them.  They are practically indestructable. and exceeds my expectations.  I have them hooked up to hoses. bypassing our water softener.  I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well. which are equally as good.  A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors.  If corrosion does take place. it can become very difficult to unscrew it."
7,"I wanted a heating pad so I figured I'd get the whole kit.  This kit is a bit disappointing because the plastic dome does not fit well on the base so there is an air gap.  I have this sitting on a wooden floor and the heater has worked fine.  I just think it was very overpriced for what I got.  The plastic parts are thin and would require me to be careful if I want to use them for years to come.  I had hoped for better."
7,"I placed seeds into a miracle grow potting mix. watered. then covered up the dome and in 3 days every one of the 12 species had sprouted to about an inch tall (or more in the case of fast growing sunflowers).Echinacea. red lettuce. romaine lettuce. snap peas. orange sunflower. red sunflower. chives. 4 different heirloom tomatoes. and dill - all of them are growing like weeds.  As soon as they're big enough for transplanting. I'll be using it again to sprout another 12 or so species for the spring garden.The moisture level is pretty constant after te first and only watering 10 days ago. since you can keep the dome mostly shut (or open it up if that's too wet).My only complaint is that the dome dribbles water when you move it since the set is designed with the clear plastic dome on top/over the edge.  But. that was nothing a tea towel under the seed bed doesn't fix.  For the price. I really couldn't be happier!"
7,"This simple and inexpensive pad has been WONDERFUL.  The difference it makes in sprouting my seeds is incredible.  At first. I cautiously placed the pad and greenhouse on a table. fussing over it. Now. its on the tile floor (with a towel underneath to keep the cold ceramic tile from leaching too much heat) and works well without notice.It comes with a plastic egg-carton like tray to start your own seeds with your own soil.  However. I'm lazy.  I just put one of those square trays with the soil pellets in them ($5 from the hardware store) to start my seeds instead; fits and works perfectly.I will not be without this ever.  Temperature is great.  Keeps a consistent warmth into the soil.STRONGLY RECOMMEND."
7,"This Hydrofarm hothouse with heat mat is a simple and effective way to start your plants from seed. The heat mat in particular will last you years and years most likely. The hothouse itself is of questionable manufacture. being a flimsy plastic. but it does what it is supposed to perfectly. There is a vent on top and one to either side of it as well to help control the temp and humidity if you dont use a guage. The 72 seed cells are likewise nothing special. but are again. quite effective. I have placed a variety of seeds in this. from tomatoes. to peppers to quinoa to tobacco. and everything tends to spout within 4 to 7 days. Anyways. even though of flimsy manufacture. the price is right and the goods are effective. so i give this 4 stars accordingly. Just be gentle with it. and if necessary. save the mat in the event that you damage the hothouse.Enjoy!"
7,"Very happy with the product.  The heat is consistent and I love the ability to adjust airflow.  The only suggestion and reason for 4 starts instead of five is that condensation tends to drip out.  The plastic could have been moulded with the lip turned up and drain ridges put in which would have kept the condensation in.  It doesn't pour out or anything but I've had to put a piece of cardboard and a garbage bag under the unit to prevent it from ruining my table.  Also happy with Amazon shipping to Japan for me since. even with shipping. it's cheaper than what is available here.  Will definitely be ordering more Hydrofarm products in the future."
7,"When I first opened the package. I was disappointed.  This cover and box is about the same thickness & quality as a jiffy mini-greenhouse that you could pick up for less than 10 bucks.  If you're expecting a heavy duty piece. this isn't for you.  It seems to do the job though.  The little side and top vents are the same quality as the rest. so don't expect anything mind-blowing.  On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity.  I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover.  As long as it doesn't fall over and get stepped on. I am sure I'll be happy.  One misstep though and this thing is going to crack and be ready for the trash bin.  I WOULD buy this again. although I'd be much happier if it were 15 bucks."
7,"This Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer is handy for automatic watering of trees and shrubs. It operates on two 9-volt batteries. It consists of a motor-operated valve and a timer.  The user attaches the female coupling of the valve to a hose bib and the male coupling to a garden hose or drip irrigation pipe.  The timer can be removed from the assembly for easy programming.  There are four watering cycles per day; it can be programmed to run seven days or any day(s) of the week. or every 2nd day or 3rd day. The timer can also be turned on manually.  However. each cycle or manual operation lasts only up to 6 hours.  I found it inadequate because I use the timer for drip irrigation. which by its nature can last a lot more than 6 hours.  Other than the short duration. this Orbit timer runs well."
7,"I have owned this little unit for over a year and it works great.  Why? It is hard for birds to judge the depth of the water when it is not moving so they may pass over your bath thinking that it is too deep.  (this may sound silly to us. but it is true).  I get 2-3 times more birdbath activity now.  You still have to clean your water and I remove the Wiggler before winter.  The batteries last many months.  Honestly. the price is a little steep for what it is. but it is worth it for what it does - attracts more birds.  It should last many seasons with proper care."
7,"Fiskars is a respected brand and I'd buy from them again. just not this particular pruner. The sliding lock mechanism is easy to operate and the pruners have a good spring to them.When I first got this pruner. it worked great. The cuts were clean and straight. After about three weekends of pruning (mostly rose bushes). the blades started dulling and no longer cut cleanly every time. Softer plant parts like dahlias flower stalks get squished and caught between the blades. causing them to stick together and not spring back open. This can leave a messy cut with jagged ends of plant tissue and cambium exposed. especially with stems that have soft. fibrous outer layers of bark. like green rose branches. For woodier cuts like camellia. it is still fine.Sometimes holding the pruners upside-down from the orientation pictured in the product photo helps deliver a clean cut. So. I rate this pair of pruners only average. because it has the same problem as my previous pruner with squishing stems."
7,"If you have rose bushes. the Fiskars Pruner is a must have. I love fresh roses in the house but hate those pesky thorns and always had a heck of a time removing them. With the Fiskars Pruner. I was able to remove all thorns rather quickly (it only took one or two times to get it down) and found the pruners to fit really well in my hand. eliminating any hand discomfort.  The blade is sharp and shows no sign of rust after using them for a season. This is a really useful tool and I absolutely would recommend others to purchase!"
7,"Purchased this snow removal tool for my wife. who uses her car on a daily basis for work.  While the car trunk is already filled with an assortment of semi-helpful gadgets. assuring her safety on the road. the Sno Brum is unquestionably in the top 5.  The tool is simple. effective. and does &#8220;what it says it does&#8221; easily. The tool doesn&#8217;t scratch the car body. is lightweight. and yet durable.  Don&#8217;t hit the snowy roads this winter without it!  All the more in Connecticut. a state in which a regulation will go into effect whereby cars may be fined up to $1000 for excess snow and ice flying off."
7,"This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car.  But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops.  I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole.  The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover."
7,"This feeder works so well. I brought a second.  I have alot of squirrels and most have given up.  I must confess a couple have leaped from the pole to the perch. but it closed and they gave up. They try to come off the top and try to chew on it. since it have a metal top. again they given up or fall off trying to stretch to the feeder opening.  This feeder is about squirrel free as possible.  I have loads of cardinals. finches.titmouse. woodpecker and no problems landing on it. It is expensive. I have seen ones in Wildbirds Unlimited for $100.  Worth the money."
7,"The best squirrel proof feeder out!  We purchase our first one in 2007 and recently the perches came loose and we lost them - a simple call and email to the company brought us a new set in just a few days.  Great support!  Feeder is easy to load and easy to use and works great.  When we lost the perches we purchased a new one and then got the parts for the old one - now we use two and they are wonderful - expensive but well built. last a long time and company stands behind them.  Worth every penny!"
7,"As a Christmas gift to a friend. I am helping her feed the birds.  She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure.  We wanted to draw an assortment of birds. not just sparrows.  This feeder is drawing tit mice. gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows.  The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week.  We are very pleased with it!"
7,"The birds don't like it at all....I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do.  I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this.  If you don't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor. and it's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground.  I would have to say that I can't see how a squirrel would get to the food...I will say that about it.  But what good is it if the birds don't get to it either?  I'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds."
7,"Pricey yes but you get what you pay for. This is my third feeder but this one is the best made bar none. It was already assembled but with very well written instructions on taking it apart and cleaning. It is VERY big/long and holds a ton of feed which is good and easy to fill. The top locks nicely too so critters cannot get the feed. The cardinal ring is awesome and within 2 hours many cardinals learned how to feed on the unit. Other feeders no where near match this quality and design."
7,"This feeder I do really like. It helps me fight my squirrel problem &#34; but I do have some smart squirrels&#34;  a few have figured out ways to work around it but it is difficult and they don't stay very long. So it does work  and I like it.For any one who also has a raccoon problem you may want to try this one .  I know you told me up front in your detail about this feeder it was squirrel proof not raccoon proof .  But we were having a raccoon problem and this one he can't get off the pole and put on the ground or get the top off.  But you must be sure to close the top securely and tight.  I have two of these feeders now and the raccoon has stopped for now."
7,"Pricey? Yes. but well worth it!!  I have purchased many bird feeders over the years (including Duncraft) but this feeder is the Rolls Royce in design. construction. durability and ease of use (filling. hanging).  Squirrels have eaten the last of my birdseed - this one will definitely keep them out - so ingenious!  I also purchased the weatherguard to protect the birds. as well as the seed. from the elements. I am sooooo impressed with this feeder - I hope the birds like it as much as I do!  (ha-ha)The weatherguard was a little tricky to install but if I can do it. anyone can!  Just follow the instructions that come with it."
7,"I hung this feeder ~3 feet from the nearest object so squirrels would have to jump pretty far to get to it.  I have had them still jump to other feeder i replaced. but this one is skinny enough for them to think again.  The other birds can still get fed.  I used to have to fill my feeders every day. but now I have had this feeder for a week and it still has about 4' of seed left.  I Recommend hanging a feeder with fishing line (spider wire).  This allows you to hang it low so a squirrel cant get to it from the top."
7,"To call this &#34;spill proof&#34; is ridiculous! If the can came with a simple screw cap and a separate funnel it would be fine. Instead it comes with a cap that you have to punch out the center to fit the spout. thus rendering the cap useless for sealing the canister. and an incredibly poorly designed spout that just does not work. I ended up ignoring the spout and using a plastic funnel instead. If I can find a replacement cap at least I won't have completely wasted 20 bucks. Not recommendedPros: will hold 5 gallons. does have 2 handles. is fairly stableCons: the nozzle is a waste of time. there is no separate cap for storage - the nozzle has to be in place"
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"I like the trimmer very much although find it too heavy.  I'm not a big person.  I also find because of being able to set the trimmer head in different positions it's actually faster to do the job. For the front of hedges I position the head perpendicular to the pole then put the trimmer against the hedge and walk the length of the hedge. I don't need to swing it back and forth. On the hedges ~4' tall I make two passes.  Very quick.  The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house.  Then it becomes heavy.  But. again I don't have to keep swinging it back and forth like a hand held to reach.  I would recomend it to anyone other then people that are smaller or older than I am."
7,"A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight. but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great. but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work. but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers."
7,"This item is an impoved version of a sweeper called Clean Boy. I paid over 200 bucks for one. This is basicly the same thing. but well impoved for way less than half the price.  I use it for cleaning the driveway. around the pool and the curb.  It works very well. just dont excpect it to do anything unreasonable. Stores easy also. you can hang it up by the handle and the main unit will go flat againts the wall.  sorry my reviews arent the best.. but I can tell you this item was worth it..."
7,"This is almost too good to be true. It is flimsy and simplistic but IT WORKS!!  I have a huge paver patio courtyard (about 2500 square feet) and always found keeping it swept clean to be difficult and a drudgery at best. Thus it didn't get done very often. With this sweeper it is easy and much more thorough. Just before I discovered this on Amazon my wife and I had spent several hours sweeping with a broom and a shop vac and thought we had it clean. I got this two days later and went over part of it again just to try it out. To our surprise it picked up a lot that we had apparently missed! I am still in the process of going over it all again and getting a lot but I have to believe after this first time thorough cleaning I will pick up less in the future if I use it with some regularity. Don't expect some heavy duty high tech machine but I think you will be very pleased with the job it does."
7,"After putting this together I found it to be quite unnerving. It reminds me of a javelin. Sure it's long. but it wobbles! Do I really feel comfortable holding a wobbling chainsaw over my head? No. It cuts at the high height level but it is very unsteady and takes a bit of muscle to keep it straight on the branch. The problem is the saw blade head is just too heavy compared with the shaft and bottom.  It basically sways in the air.  I will not be using the extension rather I will just stand on a ladder to reach the higher branches. There really should be a steel pole in each piece to give it some stability. One more thing is that the blade cover doesn't stay on. It should have been designed with a clip of some sort.I'm one of those people who always throws away the product box. but I think I'll be saving this one in case it breaks.Comment Comment  Permalink"
7,"I have used this pole saw 4times in the little time I have owned it and it has done everything expected and even more. I am no stranger to the B&D brand name and the products have always served me well. I have a gas chain saw which I use when my feet are on the ground but I never ever go up a tree or ladder with it but I do have need to cut limbs I cannot reach so this battery operated pole saw takes care of that need and does it very well and the best part is the price. Very good product for the price."
7,"I've had my B&D Pole Pruning Saw for 1 week now.  I bought this based solely on comments made on this site by people in the review. They did not disappoint.  This is a nice product. I've used it 3 times now and it cut though all branches smoothly. It is lightweight and very well made.  Before I bought this I used the Woodzig Pole saw. That is not in the same league. The B&D is far superior.  I think you will be very satisfied as I am with this product."
7,"I have a non-heavy-duty version of this hose. which has worked well for me for a year or so now. and I wanted another NeverKink. because these hoses seem to be flexible and easy to coil by hand. yet able to keep water flowing.This hose is quite a bit more rigid/inflexible than standard garden hoses and other NeverKink hoses. which makes winding the hose onto a hanger a little more difficult. and handling the hose a little more difficult in general. The hose does seem like it will stand up to a lot of use. though.My only major gripe is that the female end of the hose seems to have developed a leak already. after only a few weeks' use. seemingly at the point where the hose is crimped onto the brass fitting. I'll probably buy a replacement female connection from the home center and put it on."
7,"Sure. this kinks a lot less easily than a rubber hose. but NEVER SAY NEVER!!!  It's a decent hose with nice HD brass ends. but it WILL kink.  Keep in mind if you're using a hose in colder weather. rubber is the only way to go.  These vinyl hoses STINK in the cold and have a memory of how they're stored.  They're awesome in warmer climates though!Overall we're happy with the hose. but believe it shouldn't claim that it'll &#34;Never Kink&#34;."
7,"I needed a 75' version so I added this 25' size to my 50' hose of this same type.  It is lightweight and easy to deal with.  In fact. it's so much more maneuverable. I'm really surprised.  We've had some hot weather these last few days so I've already had to water considerably and this hose has made the chore much less awkward.  I also like the fact that I can spray the vegetable garden and not worry about toxic stuff from the hose material mixing with the water and affecting my crop.  I've replaced all my hoses with this type and am very pleased with them."
7,"The end you see in the picture with the handy plastic thumbscrew attached is actually a few threads shorter than a standard hose. I have a rain barrel that I wanted to use this with but it will not get a bite on the plastic faucet. My standard 50' garden hose attaches okay. as well as a quick disconnect adapter that I was using. but not this hose. Other than that is is a good quality hose and I will still use it to get water from my barrels to the gardens. just not as I originally intended."
7,"This is the 2nd roll I've purchased. so that should tell you how much I like it.  I got a 50' roll first. and liked it enough to buy another 25' roll so I would have enough and some extra to cover all my yard.This is the first hose I've used/owned that you didn't have to be super careful not to kink.  It always seemed like the higher end the hose was. the softer it was. and the more it would kink on me.  I can just roll/unroll this hose when I need it. and no issues so far.  Highly recommended."
7,"This hose is just as described.  Very nice and light.  I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage. I didn't need to use any except the one it has.  It does not leak at all. and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants.  I was considering purchasing the &#34;new&#34; green ones that expand to double or more their size. but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative.  This is it for me!  Light. but very nicely made."
7,"I looked at all the Hori-Horis available on Amazon and read all the reviews before settling on this one as a present for my girlfriend. an avid gardener. She was impressed by the quality. and likes how it can be used as a shallow trowel. a bulb planter. a perennial divider. a root cutter. and more. It's very handy in her garden. which borders on a nature preserve full of invasive plants. It's attractive and well made. too. I'd recommend it for any outdoor gardener."
7,"I bought this last year so this is the first spring I have had to use it.  I am seriously impressed.  I am using it for popping out weeds. hacking down dead vegetation and planting.  It doesn't dig a wide hole and does not work as well as a trowel for removing dirt while planting. but it works much better than a trowel to plant in my horribly rocky clay areas and the blade makes it easy to puncture a hole to put the plant tag.The sharpness of this is tool makes it extremely useful.  I think the serrated blade will make sharpening difficult. but for this price it is well worth getting a new one when it gets dull.  I will definitely do so and am buying some for gifts for my fellow gardening friends.Also. if you wonder what the difference between the models 1515 and 1516. according to the company's web site this one is a stainless version of the black 1515."
7,"This is a fine little scoop. I use mine for scooping charcoal into my chimney starter. and it's big enough. strong enough. good enough. and darn it. people like it. While I wouldn't go quite so far as one reviewer in saying that it looks like a $100 item from a specialty store (wish I owned a specialty store in his/her neighborhood lol). it does look well made. the finish is decent. and it is sturdy enough to lift a lot more of whatever you're lifting than will fit into the scoop.That's the scoop as I see it. hope some of you find my review helpful!"
7,"I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie's dish. After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break. I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog. does it work so much better than a bowl!! It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much. but the scoop holds a lot. and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop? It's strong. has a nice finish to it. it's easy to use. and holds a lot. In fact it's so nice. I'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he doesn't scarf it to use for the charcoal."
7,"I've always felt it's probably a little unsanitary to use an aluminum beer can with inked labeling on a hot grill.  Maybe not. but it gives me pause.  This device works as a more stable and possibly more healthy alternative to a can of Bud.  It is also perfect if you want to use other liquids such as wine. juice or whatever.  The only downside is the clean-up.  It consists of four parts. each of which get coated with chicken drippings and need some serious scrubbing to get off the cooked-on residue.  I've found a dishwasher alone doesn't really remove all of it.  A little scrubbing is necessary to really get the device clean.This is certainly a useful item for us backyard cooks.  It's a little inconvenient compared to using a beer can that can be tossed in the trash after using."
7,"This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use. easy to clean. and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook. **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie. better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!"
7,"The Good:  These skewers are perfect. much better than traditional round ones and infinitely better than wooden ones.  For everyone who has ever had the frustration of trying to turn your food on the grill only to have the skewer turn inside the food and the food stay stuck to the grill. these wide rectangular skewers are perfect.  They are very long and very durable as well.  I have cooked numerous meals with them to include beef. vegetables and chicken.  Every one came out perfect and I never had a problem with the skewer sliding around inside the food itself.The Bad:  Even though these are stainless steel. after cooking with them and washing them off they rusted.  I quickly solved this problem with a Brillo pad and before I put the skewers away in the drawer. I coated them with a very light coat of olive oil.  Problem solved."
7,"After chasing food around the typical round metal & wood skewers for quite a while I decided to go on the hunt for a better skewer. and I found them! The 'flat vs round' design allows whatever food you have on them to stay in place so that everything cooks evenly. The point. although sharp is not overly so but still sharp enough to easily pierce raw meat and the 18' length gives you plenty of room to 'load em' down with goodies or space the food out whichever suits the food being grilled. The loop handle makes it easier to grasp the skewers with a mit or tongs.A previous reviewer mentioned the 18' length and I'll agree depending upon your grill this length may be a bit long and they may be a tad better 2' shorter [that reviewer just cut his to fit].I gave these skewers 5 stars as I don't anticipate having to find anything better for kabobs!"
7,"These are perfect kabob skewers.  Very sturdy. sharp point to get through food. wide flat edge so the food doesn't spin around when you are flipping them as it invariably does with round skewers.  More expensive than bamboo skewers but unless you lose these. they should last forever.  Pay attention to the measurements as these bad boys are long.  I have a WSM 22.5 inch and 22 inch Performer and these fit but not on my 18 One Touch Silver or the little Smokey Joe.  If you have a small grill these may not work.  Otherwise. they are perfect."
7,"I use these gloves every time a bbq. so that means i use them at least once a week!  the gloves work great for taking hot meats out of the smoker.  Havent had any issues with these gloves EXCEPT for cleaning them. the exterior part is fine. but as soon as moisture gets on the inside of the gloves. it starts to kinda smell.  So make sure when you clean them that you dont get water in there.EDIT : less then a week after i reviewed these gloves. one of the fingers somehow got a rip in it and when i reached into a 200 degree pork shoulder without realizing of the rip... that was fun.  The other glove is still fine.. but now i need to order a new pair  :/  Lasted 6 months"
7,"These worked great for handling hot meat.  We also used them to adjust the hot racks in our smoker.  This partially melted the gloves so maybe that wasn't a smart idea.  Still useable. but a little rough and melty looking on the finger tips.Find it difficult to wash inside and out.  Some reviewers washed as if you were washing your hands but I require more disinfecting than that.  I would first wash while wearing them. then soak them. and even ran it through the dishwasher.  The melty fingers definately made it more difficult to clean.  Overall not that hard. just stating its not a wiz bang situation (and lord help you if you get the inside dirty)"
7,"If you smoke meat. these gloves are a must. They are food grade and insulated.Allows you to handle the meat in the smoker without using tongs or heaven forbid. forks (bad word).Always put a cuff at the bottom. unless you like the feeling of meat juice running down your arms.Easily cleaned. mild soap and water.A little stiff due to the thickness of the coating and insulation. but nothing to complain about.I store mine in a gallon baggie. Note: Fold gloves and put a paper towel over the outside of the glovesbefore trying to put them in the bag. Try it without the paper towel and you will quickly know what I mean."
7,"I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to handling foods on the BBQ and the smoker.  Before the food is cooked I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for prepping meat and putting it on the BBQ/smoker because I can 'feel' the product I am working with.  While the food is cooking I prefer to use leather gloves for handling non-food utensils. hot lids. water pans. charcoals. wood. etc.  If the food needs to be handled while cooking or smoking though. or once the food is cooked/smoked and needs handling. pulling. etc. these are what I use.  They can be cleaned easily by putting them on. soaping them up. and washing your hands under the faucet.  They are an essential part of my backyard BBQ/smoker work and greatly appreciated by the folks who will be dining with us."
7,"As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package. but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good. but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects. so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board. so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap."
7,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal. that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts. on the other hand. need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove. despite being well made and attractive. is no good for holding hot items. At best. it protects hand and arm while grilling. if you're using tongs. lets say. over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
7,"These gloves fit my size 9 hands a bit on the large size but after leaving them out one nice Florida rainy night they now fit just right.  The long cuffs are just right for opening the lid of my Weber Genesis 6611001 E-310 637-Square-Inch 38.000-BTU Natural-Gas Grill. Black.  I have used leather gloves before this and my forearms were always a bit too warm for comfort.  I cook outside about 4 times a week. summer. fall. winter (if you can call it winter in Florida) and spring working between the rain showers."
7,"Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong."
7,"works as it should..no problem..i always change the air chuck filler valve to the ball push on type..it a matter of choice..easy and cheap to change..don't like the lever action..because 1.its hard to keep on. slips off 2. hard on valve stem if its old 3.wrong angle...its a simple fix..plus the overinflat check valve is a nice feature..the last one i had lasted 5 years and i misplaced it..by the way i am a mechanic of 45 plus years..always looking for tools to make the job easier."
7,"This works very well as a tire inflator. As best I can tell. the gauge is accurate - at least within a few psi of accurate.  The bleed valve is a nice feature.You will need a quick connect.  This one works perfectly -Dixon DCP20B Brass Air Chief Industrial Interchange Quick-Connect Air Hose Fitting. Plug. 1/4' Coupling x 1/4' NPT FemaleI had no trouble with the valve connection and the red hose is plenty flexible to get wherever you need it.  This is good for car tires with the big valve. but you will need an adapter for a presta valve.  These work great -Slime 23042 Presta to Schrader Valve AdapterThere is a marking on the handle of this that says 100psi max. but the gauge reads to 150 psi.  I did not have trouble getting my tires to 120 psi with this (using a presta adapter)."
7,"I got this to go with my Craftsman air compressor that I recently got as the compressor only came with a basic inflator for the tires.  I wanted one that had a gauge on it so you could read the tire pressure when you are inflating the tires.  My compressor uses the &#34;M&#34; fittings. so I  bought the Campbell Hausfield kit to go with it to be able to get it to connect to my compressor quick connects.The inflator is fairly simple to use. just put the chuck on the tire stem and pull the lever on the chuck and inflate.  The gauge seems to be fairly accurate as I compared it to a regular tire gauge and the readings were the same.This inflator seems to be good quality and will work for what I need which is occasional use around the house.  It is a decent price at around 14 bucks."
7,"I got this saw after an ice-storm in Tulsa caused serious damage to a dozen trees.  It had no problem cutting through a 16' oak trunk.It's a workhorse that performs well. It tends to drink oil. but I guess that's good for performance and chain life.There's a gizmo that's a screwdriver/wrench for chain removal.  I lost mine because THERE'S NOWHERE ON THE SAW HOUSING TO STASH IT (are you listening Poulan).  Otherwise. chain adjustment and removal are pretty straightforward."
7,"We purchased the first of these in a refurbished unit and did quite a bit of work on it before it started having trouble. The repair was minor but the bench fee was nearly the price of replacing so went ahead and bought a 2nd one - used the chain etc from the first as spares. Pleased with the purchse. For a fraction of the cost of having tree trimmers come out for one visit this gets the job done fast. Strong enough to make quick work of most jobs plus. living in a hurricane prone state means we often need to remove limbs. large branches or even trees that come down during a storm. Rather than wait days or even weeks - this allows us to move about the yard without danger. A must own - great price. reliable product."
7,"This Gilmour brass quick connector is made in China.  As with other Gilmour products it has a warning that it contains a chemical known by the state of California to cause cancer. That is nothing new about China using dangerous chemicals. On the good news side the parts of the connector that are handled have a rubber cover which hopefully is safe.I have been using the plastic quick connectors and they have worked well but I just wanted to see how a brass one would perform. The main difference that I have noticed is that the plastic ones are easier to connect and disconnect. However. both types provide satisfactory performance and do not leak. The main difference is that the plastic Gardena connectors that I have been using cost about half the amount of the brass Gilmour.  The Gardena connectors are made in Germany."
7,"i was skeptical about these. but i tried them anyway.  glad i did.i was worried that they may affect the water pressure somehow. and my worries were unfounded.  these things are great.  i'm using them for everything.the only problem is that you will realize how many of them you actually need. and you'll buy a lot of them.FYI. i was able to pick up the male+female connector set at lowe's for around $6 (HD doesn't carry this brand).  you may want to check there first before ordering here.  but as far as the product itself goes. it's top notch."
7,"Chunk those cheap plastic connectors and save tempers.  I could have used several sets of these years ago; however. today one is sufficient for present needs. I use teflon tape to assure 100% drip-less action and now can disconnect our hose with ease and speed.  Gilmour makes life so much simpler when all parts work well and last far longer than the plastic ones.  Additionally. this connector set is a no issue set.  Put it on the bib and forget about it.  When winter comes it will stay in place and be ready for use in the spring.  I highly recommend and will buy another as soon as I get a new connector elsewhere."
7,"I have about 5 sets of these for each hose at my house as well as my Gilmour foam gun. AR pressure washer. CR Spotless. and a couple of hose nozzles.  The brass is strong. the mechanics are crisp. and the rubber gives excellent impact protection.  The only thing you will be replacing from this equation is the o-rings every year or so. depending on use.  This set will make your life a whole lot easier. and no more struggling in trying to loosen or tighten the hose from the house."
7,"In the past I've always limited my search for hose couplings to local hardware stores.  That was a mistake.  After searching Amazon and finding this highly rated product. I decided to give it a try.  Boy is this a heck of a lot better than what I've been getting.Installation is a cinch and once you have it screwed on. it isn't coming off.The threaded part of this coupling is nicely machined and screws together nicely with other attachments.  After I tried one of these. I immediately bought more and used them to replace the couplings on my other hoses."
7,"As soon as you put this in your hand you will kick yourself for not having bought it sooner.  Like many. I bought $1. $5. $7 nozzles that lasted all of one season.  They are just cheap junk.  We forget about how often we replace them because they are cheap at the time.  This particular model is their heavy duty. which should last though hot summers and cold winters.  It has brass components. a nice sturdy feel and is rated for both extreme hot and cold water conditions.  It attaches easily and does not drip at all during use.  A small depression of the handle gives you a gentle fan while a full depression gives you a powerful stream.  Compare this one with that cheapo you have now and you will clearly see the difference.  It is certainly money well spent."
7,"It is getting harder and harder to find nozzles like this that have infinately variable spray. ranging from a fan to a steady stream just by squeezing the lever.  Most new ones require you to twist a nozzel on the end...which is a waste of time when washing a car.  I have used this before.  I have 3 worn out ones in my garage.  I was happy to see  they have a lifetime warranty which I did not know.  The picture does not show it. but it has a nozzel shield surrounding the threads on the spray end.  Helpful in case it falls up against a fender!  Works great."
7,"I have bought so many hose nozzles over the years. from cheap to not-so-cheap.  They last a few seasons and then get clogged. leak or just plain break.  This Gilmour nozzle feels like it will last forever.  Nice solid feel. easy to use. good control over spray and velocity.  The threaded front is a bonus.  I add a &#34;water breaker&#34; to turn it into a gentle shower head for watering potted plants. without slowing me down by restricting the water volume output.  I can also screw on a pressure nozzle for a more focused spray and still have the pistol grip on/off.  Really happy with this purchase!"
7,"The best benefit is that I can roll it out to the yard and have all my stuff right there - no more walking back and forth to the garage ort trying to carry too much at once!  I like the wheels it comes with - they are not a cheap hollow plastic that easily snaps and they actually roll over the gravel. They will need to be sprayed with WD40 from time to time to keep them nice.  I fit all my handled yard tools on it. and find it just as easy to access tools as the kind of thing that hangs on the wall. If it had a large handle on the side. like a push-cart has it would be 100% perfect for pushing it around as hanging a towel or two on. Just a thought. manufacturer....."
7,"Got tired of buying all those little cans for 3+ bucks each. so got this to hookup the 20lb tank I got from Lowe's to my newCuisinart CGG-200 All-Foods 12.000-BTU Portable Outdoor Tabletop Propane Gas Grill.  Works great.  No problems at all.So when grilling at home. we'll be using this.  For camping or tailgating or anything. we'll go with the little cans.It all seems so obvious...so if you're in the same situation - get this and save money.  It works. and you don't need any extra adapters."
7,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder. and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault. I hung it too close to the house. but it's all I've got. really. So I watch the squirrels. who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic. so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it. which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price. it's a terrific feeder!"
7,"I have had this feeder for about 5 years now. it has never fallen apart. I don't know what the other people are talking about-wobbling-if its hung on a tree or pole hook it swings a bit but how does a hanging bird feeder wobble? Anyway its not the best made on the market. but the birds seem to like it. It is a pain to take apart to clean and it should really have metal perches instead of plastic. The squirrels have gnawed off two of the perches since they hang upside down and eat the Safflower seeds (even tho they are not supposed to like it)I am ready to replace it now-but will be looking for a feeder with the metal perches instead."
7,"I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches 'lock in' to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The 'comfort perches' are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other. and the finches who are waiting for 'their turn'. sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves. pigeons) from stealing the seed from the 'little ones'. The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers."
7,"I have this feeder placed right outside my window of my ground floor apartment. I originally got it for the cats' entertainment. and am glad I did.I originally had a feeder bell hanging from the second floor apartment's balcony. but decided it wasn't enough.I purchased this feeder for the sparrows and used the cheapest bird feed available. After I switched to sunflower seeds only I am now getting sparrows. finches and starlings. The down side being that the perches were not designed for starlings so they have to reach around to one of the other holes to get their food.Anymore. I can get 5 or so on it at once with two or three hanging out on the chain it hangs from waiting in line.I really love this little feeder and have had it since December '08.  Never once had a problem with squirrels. but it may be because of the way I have it set up."
7,"I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds. I knew instantly this was a mistake. but thought I would give it a try. One lasted only a few days at best. A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground. Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground.  The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps. but again. the same thing happened. Food everywhere and a useless feeder.  I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience.  Sorry to have to give it a one star. but I can't find a reason to even go for two."
7,"We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season. and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets. since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead. it uses egg to make it smell like something dead. and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it. it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact. this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product. so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome. but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet. and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring."
7,"We live out in the country. and my wife is an avid gardener.  We also have a roaming band of deer. usually 3-4. as well as rabbits. I've personally seen 3 at once in our yard.  We don't have many squirrels. I guess the cats and coyotes take care of them..  We have experimented with bloodmeal. and a variety of other home remedies that haven't worked very well.This product however. has worked quite well.  We have not seen any rabbits/deer. or prints from either in any of the gardens we have applied it to.  The battery sprayer works well. I'm not sure it's really necessary for the size of our gardens. I probably wouldn't pay extra for it.  I will purchase the concentrate in the future. as the pre-made mixture will not last a season. and seems to come at a premium price."
7,"Since we live in the country. we have a lot of wildlife in our yard.  While they are cute to look at. they can do a lot of damage. and some of them don't smell very good(SKUNKS)!  We have had a problem with raccoons and skunks destroying flower planters and digging up newly planted annuals. This product helped keep them out of the flowers and the battery powered sprayer makes it easy to use.One winter the deer 'trimmed' all our shrubs. even the ones right next to the house. Since our area was hit hard by EHD this past year. we didn't have that problem this past winter; and I was delighted this morning to see three deer walking down our driveway. I love watching all the wildlife. and just try to keep them out of the flowers and vegetable garden."
7,"I've maintained a garden patch for quite a few years and it has always been affected by some type of animals.  First. there were squirrels until I built a small fence.  Then there were deer until I built a bigger fence.  Then. squirrels found their way in from the top and others from below.This Deer Off seems to be helping more than any of these.  I didn't spray it around the whole yard (that's just mean). but I did set up quite the perimeter around my garden and I haven't had any animals intruding there whatsoever.  Is this the work of the Deer Off spray. or is it simply coincidence?  I'd like to think the spray is working just fine."
7,"I have a lot of rabbit and deer damage in my garden if I don't spray.  I like to alternate various sprays to keep them guessing.  This worked very well against both rabbits and deer.  I sprayed some potted begonias that had been eaten down to stubs and they are now thriving and the same with some balloon flowers.  I assume it was the rabbits that were eating them although I never actually saw the culprit.  At any rate this spray took care of the problem. It also protected my day lilies against the deer than had been munching on them.  Easy to apply too."
7,"I'm a terrible gardener. So when I finally got my watermelons to bud and start to grow I was extremely happy... until I went out and checked on them one day and either the deer or rabbits ate them all.This is a hazard for me as I'm right next to a very large forrested area. While I enjoy seeing the wildlife I didn't want to keep losing my fruits and veggies to them so I got this Deer Off. I'm happy to say that I've not had any part of my garden taken so far. And since I localized the spray to just around the garden I still see the animals on the far side of the yard (a couple hundred feet away.)I'm happy with this product and wish I'd gotten it prior to losing my watermelons."
7,"I got this at a neighbor's recommendation and I am glad I did.  I live in Deer Country and it is not uncommon to see deer strolling on local lawns even in bright daylight.  This is an effective product and deer are repelled by the taste.  I was surprised that this product had the flavors of peppery egg. which deer and small rodents apparently don't enjoy.Although this product has a bad smell. it is not overpowering and it does do the job.  This does not have a strong odor and is not human repellent based on that.You get a  motorized pupmp that runs on batteries.  It does work well and it is easy to aim and spray.  I would certainly recommend this.  It is gentle on your foliage and other greenery."
7,"I sprayed this on my yard. not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far. I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around."
7,"Rabbits have been feasting on my new lawn and I was excited to be able to try Deer Off from the Vine program. However. while rabbits are one of the critters it says it repels. I guess rabbits didn't read it. The first try I liberally sprayed it all around the perimeter of the grassy area I was trying to protect. But. judging by the fresh rabbit droppings I found each morning afterwards. I suspected it wasn't working. My second try I liberally sprayed everywhere. perimeter and main lawn. and later that night I checked outside and found 2 rabbits feasting away. Maybe they like eggs. but it doesn't appear to work on rabbits. at least not the ones I have here in San Diego."
7,"I have been using this for a little while now and while it seems to work fairly well it only lasts a week without rain and if it rains you pretty much have to go out there the same day and reapply or you get to wake up first thing in the morning to your strawberries that hang near the fence being eaten...It's good idea for the most part but it's something that just doesn't really seem to be a lasting benefit and it seems to be a more natural avenue for repelling the deer and it does work just not nearly as long as I would like it to.I've been using it for a couple month on the garden/around it to keep the unwanted animals away and it does seem to work pretty good so far. just as I said. it doesn't last nearly as long as I would like it to."
7,"Great for protecting baby fruit/nut/landscape trees from deer rubs.We have a lot of property in GA. mostly timberland. but with some fruit/nut trees planted on some cleared land where we have a small hunting cabin. We've tried a lot of different methods for keeping deer from rubbing all the bark off and killing the young trees -- this spray seems to be pretty effective. Just apply it around the time they start leaving rub marks. and trees stay safe. and alive. A little expensive. but a good option for those who don't want to bother with physical measures like protective sheathing or fencing."
7,"I bought this to try at my parents' cabin.  They have a major problem with deer eating their ornamental plants. specfically tiger lillies and hostos (or is it hostas).This particular product is nice because it the sprayer is battery operated.  So my parents like the convenience.Now for the disadvantages... I'd rather smell my own flatuence after chilli than smell this. It's awful.  But. then again many other chemical sprayers reek.  Also. this is not a set it and forget option.  You need to pay a lot of attention and reapply.  Lastly. you cannot use it for plants that will bear fruit or vegetables for consumption.All and all it's a new twist on an old concept.  I'd use it again."
7,"Living near the woods. we have all kinds of critters:  chipmunks. squirrels. rabbits. racoons. and deer.  In addition there is my nutty dog. so I don't want to use anything toxic around her.  Deer Off has non toxic ingredients. and so far seems to repel the critters. though it's still early in the season and I haven't yet planted my flowers due to the cold weather.  I especially like that Deer Off doesn't require mixing. an improvement over products I've used in past years.  So far so good. but I'll update on effectiveness when my garden is planted."
7,"I spray the deer off on all my flowers and fruit trees. it works pretty good.  I have tried other products and nothing keeps the deer from eating the flowers or fruit trees.  The deer off works for a week or so on the plants that my sprinklers spray daily. longer for the plants that I spray that do not get watered on the area I spray.  As long as I remember to spray the flowers the deer tend to not eat them. only a few times a really hungry deer came through and ate a few of the plants that were sprayed but not many."
7,"This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area. but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels. rabbits. cats. and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away. but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad."
7,"I started using this on my trail to keep the deer away. now I have been spaying it around my straw garden. I have not had any problems with deer or squirrels eating my plants. The sprayer works fine. and it doesn't hurt pets or wildlife. You do have to spray again after it rains. but other than that. this has worked pretty well for me so far. The instructions say to clean the sprayer to prevent clogging. but I have never bothered to do this. It has never clogged up on me. The product is made from eggs. but I have never really noticed any smell from using this."
7,"I had trouble getting this to spray. Some of the other reviews offer useful tips on this problem.The active ingredients are similar to certain related products: 'Contains putrescent eggs solids (4.63%). garlic (.001%) and capsaicin (.001%).' My experience with these is that they work well for up to a couple of weeks. although they need to be reapplied after a rain. or even after heavy sprinkler use. A downside of this formula is that the smell of garlic will permeate the garden."
7,"The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks. not the claimed three months. and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them.  I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard.  Two weeks later I'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well.  I like the safety lock just below the sprayer's trigger. I intend to use the sprayer for my weed killer even though the power could be improved."
7,"First of all. the battery that came with it didn't work. so I had to buy new ones.  The lock switch on the spray head is hard to lock and unlock. It took awhile for the liquids to start coming out after I held down the spray trigger. Probably like 5 minutes. Anyways. once it starts. it work ok. Doesn't have much pressure to spray far. Anyways. after spraying like quarter of the bottle on my trees. entire backyard smelled like burned wood. I haven't seen squirrels on those trees so far and it's been 2 weeks."
7,"I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience. this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas. plumeria. etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season."
7,"As the title of my review says. the electric sprayer is excellent. It took probably a minute of priming (pressing the trigger with nothing coming out of the sprayer) during my first use before the spray started to come out; since then. it sprays right away when I pull the trigger.The spray stream goes about six feet or so. and it's easy enough to aim it at trees or fence or whatever. You can adjust the tip of the sprayer in order to make the spray more of less focused (that is. more stream or more misty).I'll use this spray bottle even after the repellent is gone. It will be useful for weed sprays. insect repellents. etc.The repellent itself has only been moderately successful in our yard. Our issue is bunnies and they haven't seemed to be bothered by the repellent - their activity in our yard after a couple of applications of the repellent is basically the same as before the applications."
7,"I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it. so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times. but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair. it hasn't rained since applying this. so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected. but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future."
7,"My small garden had frequest visits from rabbits. squirrels. and other small pests.  However. regular applications of the HAVAHART DEER OFF II stopped the night time visits cold.  This was true even in the late fall when rain comes a little more frequently to the area - the DEER OFF II was not easily washed away and continued to protect my leafy greens.I also appreciated the battery-operated sprayer.  As someone who easily gets hand cramps and forearm pain from typical pump sprayers. I was happy to pay a little extra for the battery-operated bottle.  You don't really have to use alot. depending on the size of your garden. but it made my hand very happy.This product was ideal all the way around - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
7,"I am not quite ready to make a large declaration of 'Eureka' for this product. The reason is because we wanted to use this to see if it would help keep the rabbit and squirrel out of the garden and it isn't yet time for the big test as we just got finished planting. For now I can say I haven't seen an increase in critter and I haven't experienced any negatives from the product. I will make sure to update in a few weeks when things get ready to harvest to talk about how well the product really worked.I can say the product was easy to apply and the smell isn't overpowering. I felt safe using it near fruits and veggies growing (but did not spray it 'on' any of the raised bed garden frames).Will definitely update in a few weeks."
7,"I like the fact that Deer Off is all-natural or I wouldn't have used it.  It comes with a battery-operated sprayer that works fairly well and delivers a good stream.  I walked twice around my garden while spraying a steady stream of Deer off around the perimeter.  The sprayer should be flushed out with clean water after each use.The odor around my garden wasn't unpleasant to me.  An application is supposed to last for 90 days but long before 90 days I saw rabbits in the garden.  On the plus side I haven't seen any signs of deer in the garden. and they potentially eat a lot more than rabbits.So it's effectiveness is inconclusive but at least it doesn't hurt to try."
7,"We wanted to use Deer Off on a weeping willow tree that deer have almost pushed over. They seem to think it's a good place to sharpen their horns.We staked the tree back upright and the deer have seemed to have left the tree alone. Don't know if it was the Deer Off. the time of year or because the deer could also smell us and where we touched the tree.Edit to add more information:When Spring got here. after planting our garden. we had deer eating our tomato plants right off at the base so we sprayed our entire garden with this. This Deer Off has seemed to deter the deer but it burnt our plants. Every plant we sprayed has burnt places on them.The sprayer is also not easy to use."
7,"I still have all my flowers out front so it must be working.  It has a mild smell when first sprayed but dries up and becomes odorless fairly quickly.  It doesn't bother my dog though as he still walks up to the bushes to urinate on them. so dogs. or at least him. must not be bothered by it.  I use this in combination with the Havahart Solar Powered Water Sprinkler in my backyard raised garden bed and so far so good.  If you have trouble with rabbits. deers. and squirrels. give it a try.  It's safe around humans and pets.  I recommend it."
7,"I've had this on the plants for about a week now and so far I have seen less damage from the deer.  That might be somewhat seasonal. so I'll have to watch and see over the long term how effective this is.  I've also sprayed it around the trash cans to keep the raccoons away and it has been effective at that too.  I can certainly smell it myself. so this is not something you'll want to spray onto plants  near a door or window.  Thanks to the powered spayer. it is easy to apply.  In that regard I think this would be an excellent product for anyone with limited strength or mobility.  I can definitely see this as being helpful for an older person with a lot of property or greenery who has a critter problem."
7,"We've had continual issues with deer. rabbits. squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers. vegetables and fruit.  We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets.  I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell.  I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers. several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry.  The deer seem to be repelled. with no evidence of any damage from them.  On the negative side. the chipmunks aren't deterred at all.  They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note. the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping.  The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking. but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try.  If you're trying to control chipmunks. don't waist your time."
7,"We had a woodchuck last year. a big woodchuck. that decided to set up camp in our backyard.  She(I believe it is a she) ate everything she could get to. nothing was safe.  Thankfully the vegetable garden had a fence but we lost half of our unfenced flower garden.  As soon as things started sprouting this year I started spraying but not what I thought was excessive.  We have not seen our big friend in our garden this year but I did see her in a neighbors yard the other day so I'm hoping it was the Havahart Deer Off and not that she moved to a better neighborhood.We don't have a problem with rabbits or deer and the only issue we have with squirrels is they like to bury nuts in our garden and flower boxes in the fall. so we will see how it goes with them later in the year. The sprayer works well and I'm really interested to see how long the pump lasts and will update as to that also. Recommended."
7,"I have lots of mulched areas in my yard. After using Havahart Deer Off II. I have noticed that the squirrels and rabbits do not go near those sprayed areas. It is wonderful to not have to clean up the mulch everyday...and plants can continue to grow! The sprayer was amazingly simple to use with the battery powered sprayer and it takes much less effort than using a hand triggered device. I don't have any deer around my property. so I can't address its effectiveness in keeping them at bay. but it sure worked for repelling the other critters. I'm looking forward to spring!"
7,"We have a ton of wild bunnies where I live and I love to grow green beans.  Unfortunately. the bunnies love the green bean plants too.  I was having a worse than usual year where they were chewing my beans down to the ground regularly.  I got the Deer Off and. guess what. I have green bean plants again!  It has completely stopped them from eating my plants.  I also love the battery powered sprayer.  My garden is decent sized and other sprayers make my hand sore by the time I'm done which makes me less likely to use the product as often as I should.  With this. I just hold the trigger down and it does all the work.  My only complaint is that it washes away when I water or it rains so I'm out there every single day applying the Deer Off.  If it rains or I water and don't do it. the bunnies are back snacking on my green bean plants."
7,"We have a yard full of fruit trees that we never get to enjoy any fruit from.We also have a mature pecan tree and have to purchase pecans.The squirrels steal everything before it's ready to harvest.I was excited to try this and hoped it would allow us to sample some of the fruit we never get to eat.The battery operated sprayer is very nice. making it extremely easy to use.Our squirrels must be very determined little critters because they weren't phased by the product and continued to strip the fruit from the trees at their normal pace.Part of the problem may be their ability to leap from tree to tree without having to climb the trunks to get to the fruit.The product may work better under different circumstances."
7,"Easy enough to apply and not messy.In order to test it's effectiveness we not only applied this to our own trees but with the permission of one of our neighbors we applied it to two of her trees as well. This was two months ago and I have to admit that all the trees that were treated with this product were avoided by the deer. Including our neighbors two trees. while her other trees and bushes were chewed on instead. I suppose it will remain to be seen how long it will last over all. I'm sure we got the mileage we did because of the extended dry weather we experienced her in Wyoming this summer. Moisture I'm sure would wash away the Deer-off rather quickly otherwise.This bottle contained enough to cover 8 trees and 4 small shrubs. In a dry climate one dose can last up to two months. however I'm sure that in a wetter climate multiple re-applications would be necessary."
7,"The product is easy to apply. I use it around some raised planters. the garden. and our dryer vent which leaves the house only about 8 inches above the ground (we've gotten critters in it before). It does seems to work (for us on rabbits) as the plant damage is lessened in the raised planters and garden. Our yard is fenced so deer are not a problem and I couldn't test it on them. This summer the product lasts longer as it was extremely dry. I do reapply after it rains otherwise it loses it effect. Good to use/try if exposed plants are getting visits by rabbits."
7,"Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that. I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs. they work. but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray. I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?"
7,"I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here.  I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants.  This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries.  The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle.  No more pumping my old sprayer.  The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray.  Lightweight is good.  Most importantly. it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures.  Also. the battery operated sprayer is reusable.  I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out. but I think the half gallon will last awhile.  This is a great product."
7,"The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use.  Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing.  Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds.  Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver.  Even then. when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry. NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers.  I guess anything is better than starving.  Ditto with the squirrels.  They eat their way through the product to get to the food."
7,"The Havahart Deer Off Ready-To-Use Repellant applied a lot of repellent quickly. It was easy to set the direction of the spray. The battery option was a great addition to spraying to keep the deer from eating and/or trampling our plants and it made the application process a lot easier. It appears to work well as there has been no damage of plants after the first application.On the other hand. there was no wand with our bottle of repellant which made it impossible to apply a fine mist/spray (packaging implied it should have been part of what we received). The bottom compartment was hard to open and the nozzle we had to use because of having no wand dripped while applying.Update: This spray is doing a fantastic job of keeping the squirrels out of the birdfeeders."
7,"The rabbits had me at my wits end having destroyed a large section of a newly sodded lawn. The rabbits were having their way with me and I was losing the battle. I started using Deer Off. reseeded the bare sections. and now my lawn is green again. The 'power' nozzle makes spraying a large area a snap allowing me to cover the perimeter of the lawn quickly. A single treatment lasts about three to four days or until we have a rain. At the first sign of the little vermin I get out the sprayer and re-apply Deer Off. I might be applying it a little sooner than really needed but when I see the first rabbit droppings I do a new application.I like it much better than the other product I was using because it does not have to be mixed and does not leave my clothes and hands with an awful odor."
8,"I purchased the Trilogy with hoping my two cats. age 3 and 5 would be interested.  The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on. she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder. that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.  I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that don't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do."
8,"My Rottie has food allergies to poultry. beef and dairy. I've had a difficult time finding a toothpaste that doesn't make him allergic and he enjoys the taste. This toothpaste is peanut flavor (smells like black licorice). He loves the taste and doesn't wiggle as much when I brush his teeth every night. The price is ok. but I do wish that the tube came in a larger size. Soooo. if your pup has allergies or doesn't like his/her current toothpaste you might want to try this one."
8,"my dog like his kibbles more than treats (he LOVES to eat!!). and with this sprinkled on top of his food.he refuses to eat. the smell is super strong even I pull away my head when I open the jar.And. even when i hand fed him the food. he still tried to play with his poop.  (granted. he consumed smaller portion than the recommended by the direction)Overall. it may keep dogs away from their poop because they can smell this in their poop. but that same smell is present on their food. which obviously repells them.So. I do not recommend this product unless your dog eats EVERYTHING."
8,"This product didn't work for my dogs at all. and the smell of it was difficult to put up with (for me). It smelled like a Christmas candy cane gone all wrong. I put it in front of them on their (dry) food. I've never seen two dogs so sad to eat their food in my life. My dogs usually chow down their food really fast. Eventually I started mixing it with a bit of pumpkin to make it more tolerable for them. In the end thogh. it didn't work and my only solution seems to be keep an eye on them like a hawk when they're out (in the fenced on yard) and dispose of the poop within a minute of it hitting the ground."
8,"I bought this product to stop the problem we were having with our 6 month old puppy. We have 5 little dogs that are paper trained. The product smells horrible to me. enough to make my stomach turn. I mixed it with canned food and all but one dog really loved it. I forced myself to tolerate the smell and continued to feed it to them for a couple of weeks once a day. It has helped to stop the problem even though one dog wouldn't eat it. I have stopped it for about a week now and it still seems to be working. I have my fingers crossed because I really don't want to smell it as I feed it anymore."
8,"We've owned a whole set of these for our dogs and cats; they've never broken. warped. or discolored in all the years we've had them. They stack great in pantries and feature a space for locks if you have an animal that may try to help themselves. They've survived beach trips. time outdoors. and one really naughty standard poodle pulling a full one to the floor. We've also used one to store extra cat litter and another wild bird seed.Their only bad feature is they are not air or water tight; they will keep food fresh for sure but not like an unopened bag. I'd recommend you be able to use any food in them within a month or two. If you have a dog with allergies to storage mites you will want to either wash these bins between bags or choose a bin that is air tight."
8,"I just received this product and I ordered it for my dog&#8217;s food. I bought a 30 pound bag that I&#8217;ve been using and then filled in this container but it over flowed! (My dog eats Natures Recipe for adults) So right of the back a little FYI. Also the door for closing has a little snapped and it has a place on top to put a lock. Since mine was full the door is snapping back open.I ordered this product because it looked convenient to take the food out and I liked the container size. The size is the only reason why I&#8217;m thinking about keeping it but I&#8217;m not 100% sure right now."
8,"I have one of these that I have had for years and love it. Wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold 40lbs. In the title this one states Size: 40lbs.  However....this one is TINY and no way that it will hold 40lbs. In the further description it says that it holds 27-29lbs (which I didn't read as I stopped at the title) but I am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much.  So if you are looking to put a 15lb bag of food in this...no problem.That is the only reason for the one star.  Other than that the product is great for it's purposes.  It is not intended to be air tight.  It is easily opened with an arm full of dishes. etc."
8,"The trouble with Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplements is that some of them work and some of them don't. And sometimes a brand that has worked stops working. So far CosaminDS works. I hope the manufacturer doesn't try to increase their profit by reducing the active ingredients. So far it's the most effective Glucosamine/Chondroitin I've tried.Edit: They work better than any other supplement I have tried. But best to order them in the cool months. so they don't spend the several days in above 100degrees."
8,"My dogs veterinarian recommended that I try this product a few years ago.  I have been taking it ever since.I have had surgery twice on one knee and I had a lot of pain.  It took many months before I felt any difference at all. but eventually I noticed my knee was not hurting! What a relief!Now I can walk a few miles with no pain at all.  If I do get a little selling or stiff. I ice for 15 minutes. and just put on a salonpas patch and I am fine in 10 minutes.  Happy days...If my review helped you. can you please take a moment and click on the 'helpful' button? Thanks! :)"
8,"I have had littermaids for about 10 years. In those 10 years. I have had two of them in which they work awesome. I have 4 cats. and its awesome just having to dump the plastic waste holder out every day. or every other day and not have to worry about litter all over the place and scooping. I have my current unit in a closet. and with 4 cats it has worked great for the last two years! !Once the plastic lid and waste holder get a little worn. litter can fall between the crack which can be a pain. but I try to open the waste door carefully and pull the waste holder out gently to ensure the waste holders last a while before I have to replace...When this unit wears out. I will move up to the Elite. which is bigger. But going strong on two years. hopefully it will keep working hard!"
8,"My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit (it's used by 2 cats daily).  After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models. I decided to stay with the LM500 and I don't regret it. The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box. but it works great (my cats each weigh about 7-3/4 lbs. they're small cats. so the size difference wasn't a major problem). I have no regrets getting this model again.  Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates. but I had to do that with the old box too. When you change and clean the litter box section. wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter. it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily."
8,"Current version of littermaid does not work well at all. The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it. The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original. The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died.I found the old version (on Amazon). It worked for six days and then died. It was replaced at no charge. The second one worked for six weeks and then died. I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase. So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually.DO NOT buy this product. This system forced me to give this product at least one star. I would give it -5 if I could."
8,"Ok. I don't own this. but have thought about it. After discovering arm and hammer cat box deodorizer...I can live without the littemaid. I buy cheap litter because I've heard that clumping litter can be bad for kitties because they lick their paws and it can cause intestinal blockage. I keep the box. garbage bags. the litter and the deodorizer in the closet - every 3rd day or so I just dump the whole box and add new litter and the deodorizer. I do smell it right after the kitties go - but not shortly thereafter. Try this. if you are leary of buying the litter maid.  I rated it a 3 since I have no experience and it seems a lot of people hate this thing!"
8,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing.This is incredibly finicky about precise fill level. I must have overfilled by 1/4' or so. because it stopped working properly after the first day. The scooper still scooped but the thing seldom opened the lid of the receptacle.With such shallow litter. my cats had trouble digging and covering.The fact that a scoop is included in the package is informative.I gave it two stars instead of one because the charcoal filter does a good job of odor control. And another clock in the house is always handy."
8,"I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out. although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean. but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle. fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle. remove the bag with its contents. tie the top in a knot to contain the odor. and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process."
8,"I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years.  NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid.  This model died Monday after 2-1/2 years. but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off.  The cord finally snapped on Monday.  Not only the short lifespan considering the price. but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan.  No matter what litter brand I tried. it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan. would stick to the rake. and eventually cause the machine to cut off.Just purchased an Omega Paws. which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed.Good idea. very poor longterm performance."
8,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I. for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake. caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
8,"The plastic rake is spaced in a way that it won't work with my. and my cat's. favorite litter.  Yes it's a clumping litter.  Also the tongs on the rake are very wide.  This litterbox scoops a lot of clean litter into the bin (even with the smallest clumping litter I could find).  It wastes a LOT of litter. pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it's path into the bin... more of a shovel. than a rake IMO.  In order to not waste more litter than is used. I would have to dump out the bin and scoop that in order to save the wasted clean litter.... far more of a hassle than useful.I would not repurchase this item. nor would I recommend it to a friend.... an enemy.... maybe."
8,"I left a review regarding Petmate Purrforma jumbo. it was a smelly.horrible mess. Well. I got lucky. My PetSmart told me to bring the Purrforma back and they would credit all toward a new Littermaid and supplys for it. There was even enough credit left for 2 30# bags of the Nutro dog food I use. The Puurforma is so overpriced as well as poorly designed. I had the receipt for the Puurforma from the month before. I now have my 3rd multicat Littermaid and am very happy again. While not perfect. as litter cleaning will never be perfect. these do work well for me. I have one in the laundry room. one downstairs and the other at my farm. I have yet to find a cat that will not use this box. My cats at home are all over 10 years old. At the farm they are 2 years and younger. Hope this helps."
8,"This is my second one. I will always use the self cleaning litter box. It is healthier for your cat(s). easier on me and keeps your home cleaner. I live in an apartment and my manager complemented me on how 'well I care for my cats'. My vet says my 14 year old cat looks 7 and I firmly believe this litter maid has something to do with it. He has had the litter main most of his life. My 'skid-dish' cat. he uses all the time but waits to see it move. kind of funny. All I know is when this one goes. I will buy a new one again. These are worth every penny I spend to have another day with my cats."
8,"Pros:Keeps litter better contained. It falls inside the tent or right in front of the entrance. instead of all over the room.Gives the cats privacy.Keeps the smell down a bit.Cons:It's difficult to get the zipper closed.The litterbox doesn't fit out the entrance easily (and unzipping it is out of the question).It's difficult to reach inside and scoop out clumps that the littermaid rake missed (and it misses lots of clumps. so I have to deal with this problem 3-4 times a day)."
8,"The tent is made of two parts assembled with a zipper. that fit around a structure made of flimsy hollow plastic rods. The problem lies in the structure. which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of an average cat. If your cat likes exploring and climbing on top of things like most cats do. the frame will break quickly.If you're minimally handy. you can very easily make yourself a much better structure using PVC piping and joints (they're inexpensive and can be found in the plumbing section of any hardware store). If your cat is heavy and a climber. I would strongly suggest not even bothering with the supplied frame and building your own right away.Another irritating problem is that replacing the waste receptacles is extremely inconvenient when the littermaid is in the tent.All in all. unless you absolutely have to hide the littermaid. this tent is poorly designed and more trouble than it's worth."
8,"I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.Pros:  provides coverage. privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control.  Does not retain odor.Cons: Fits too tight. which causes the zipper to break and fail.  Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily.  COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.Overall. I have owned several of these.  Eventually. they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail.  That's really all I can say about it."
8,"I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand.  The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo.  Also. the velcro already attached (not nearly enough to do anything) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand.  Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading. which this does not do.  there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro. the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit.  Don't waste your $$ on this accessory."
8,"I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan"
8,"Cheap 'n' cheezy. just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older. sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market. since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags. but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid. so have to be replaced despite being lined."
8,"These receptacles offer poor value for the money. and are constructed of very cheap. flimsy plastic.Pros:Necessary for LitterMaid self-cleaning litter boxes.Cons:Cheap & flimsy plastic.Do not fit tightly.Too small.Do not keep out odor.Poor customer support.If you have a LitterMaid self-cleaning litter box; you'll have little choice but to purchase these. They function reasonably well at collecting cat waste. but are poorly designed. The problem is that they're made of very flimsy plastic and the design makes it impossible to get a tight fit when placing them in the LitterMaid box. The charcoal filter does virtually nothing to eliminate odors. and with the lack of a tight fit. the odors are very noticeable. In addition; this company has poor customer support."
8,"I agree these are somewhat expensive - I wish they'd improve these by making it easier to lift a full one out to throw away.  I don't know if that's something on the littermaid itself that should be improved. or the design of these to include a handle of something on each side that sticks up so you can pull a heavy/full one up and out of the box.  I recently tried a petmate that has a reusable plastic receptacle to which you place little baggies made for it. and its very much similar sized to these receptacles. Returned that terrible box and went back to the littermaid but I have a few extra of the baggies and I am going to try putting them into this receptacle.  They are designed to lift out and cover/tie all in one and that's the only thing I liked about the petmate btw."
8,"I find that the Littermaid works very well for what it is designed to do. The only truly unpleasant task is changing these waste receptacles. The difficulty I seem to experience is inserting a new receptacle. It is difficult to get the thin retaining lip on the tray itself securely under the plastic flanges attached to the litter box which retain the tray. Once it is in place. it works like a champ. but in a future redesign. I hope that the good folks that design this fine line of electric self-cleaning cat boxes will develop a more secure retaining method that facilitates easier receptacle changeout."
8,"The receptacles I got with my first Littermaid (for multiple cats) were very flimsy. The replacement box of 12 (as shown) I got afterward were also flimsy.  This did not stop us from reusing the trays over and over.  It doesn't make sense not to. but eventually they get pretty brutalised from removal and reinsertion.Oddly enough. when we got our second LitterMaid (regular sized) the receptacles that came with it were sturdier and more durable.  Why they arent all manufactured at this thickness is beyond me.  Actually. I'm sure it's a case of trying to get more money out of us at cheaper manufacturing cost. but it's a little ridiculous when they are that flimsy."
8,"There are three main problems with this product. The first is that it does not fit the littermaid box well at the base (where the box fits into the botoom). As a result you end up with some cat litter on the floor as a result. instead of all of it in this product. Secondly. the top part does not fit into the top well. Some effort required to get it in properly. Thirdly. the product is made of very weak plastic. As a result. if it is filled up. it bends quite a bit (to the point where it makes handling a chore). Higher quality/harder plastic should have been used to avoid this problem."
8,"First. the noise level is low.  Nothing that's going to drive humans crazy.  Second. the Wiggly Giggly Ball is everything it promises to be.  Tough. makes low-level noise. and requires no batteries.  Love that.  Though my current dog didn't go bonkers over this ball. I've had dogs who loved batting them about.  My dog is into noisy toys but not balls so much.  But I'd still recommend the Wiggly Giggly Ball for its quality and durability."
8,"This 'wiggly giggly' ball was very disappointing.  I ordered the first one that seemed to be defective. which of course amazon was quick to replace.  The second one came and was no better than the first one.  It would only make those cute little noises if I shook it like a crazy person. but as soon as I would roll it for my little dog. it went mute.  He lost interest in it pretty fast after that so it went back.  I would have kept it for just a regular ball for him but at almost $12. I thought that was a little pricey for a do nothing ball."
8,"At first it looked like it was going to work great (when the litter was clean). After a day or so. it wasn't cleaning very well. I got better litter and it started working better. but still not great. Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake. After about two weeks of use. the rake stopped moving backwards. I tried to fix it. but it just won't go in reverse. Overall. this was a big waste of time and money. I'm not even going to try to get another one. A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean. It's too bad as it had a promising beginning. DO NOT BUY."
8,"I like hiking with my dog and purchased this collapsible bowl for our outdoor excursions.I also use it whenever I take him to the vet or in the car. Dogs over heat in this weather very quickly. carrying water is essential.This bowl is handy and easy to slip into your pocket. just put it on a flat surface and fill it with water or food.My dog hasn't gotten the opportunity to chew it because I take it away as soon as he's finished.This is one of the more sturdier bowls I've found and I'm very satisfied with it."
8,"I was betrayed by a dog 'expert' that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on. but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece. poop and all."
8,"Like other Planet Dog toys. this ball is good. but not the best.  The knot in the rope comes undone quickly. so you will have to tie it again.  Also. if you have a constant chewer/mouther on balls (and don't just use it for fetching). the outer shell of the ball can come apart off of the inner shell that has the continents on it.  But that is usually after lots and lots of chewing.  Other than that. my dogs LOVE these balls.  They love the softness and the chewability."
8,"Got this as a 'present' for my roommate's dog because her old toy was destroyed. Figured it'd be safe because my own dog is really particular about her toys. and so I'd only get one.That was a mistake. The instant I pulled the toy out both dogs wee enthralled. and are now engaged in a very long game of hide-and-seek/ keepaway. I'm pretty positive I will be ordering another monkey in the immediate future.The sock monkey version of this toy is a nice soft plush with that doesn't have 'long hair' or anything - it just feels like. well. a soft cotton sock. It's a good size and the limbs are different shapes/widths. which is great because that means dogs with any type of muzzle can pick it up and run with it.I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for new all purpose puppy toys. We fetch. play tug of war and chase with this toy- it's brilliant!"
8,"My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks. Oh! He loved the toy and always kept him close. even sleeping with him. However. for a reason known only to 'Igor'. he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces. I managed to salvage the voice box. but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice. However. since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced. I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking."
8,"This may be the best of all the Mutipet toys! Previously gave great reviews of others. but this one never stops! They bite it.  step on it. sit on it and hide it from each other. It always gives itself away tho with its 'OOOOONNNOOOOOO!!!!' I keep 2 around here and have given several to friends. I think it's particularly popular with those of us who remember Mr Bill. but it sure translates to the dogs!While these are really durable for us I don't think real chewers will take long to dismantle this. My guys are over 80lbs bot don't chew or pull things apart."
8,"To heck with the dogs or cats!  I got this for myself to play with!  I press the belly and out comes OHHH NOOO.  Comes in handy on occasions to bring levity to ponderous situations. like the tax bill. marital debates. forgot to get something at the grocery store. an unexpected expense. lost Amazon order; you know all those life situations where you just need to bring humor into the situation.  We are enjoying using it in our household.  The cat. though. did bat at it. tried to run with it thinking it was his.  OHHH NOOOO. I said.  Not a lasting quality item. but a fun time."
8,"Not only does my dog love this toy. but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the 'Ohhhh Noooooooo'  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup. I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped. I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you. or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
8,"My dog is an 80lb. mixed breed who just loves to pull the stuffing out of any and every toy. Mr. Bill far outlasted any thing with a squeaker in it because of his speaking box. When the dog started getting a little rough. the &#34;Ohhhhhh Nooooooo!!!&#34; would make him stop. Ahhhh. but it was not to be. Mr. Dog conquered Mr. Bill. but it took him over 2 months to slowly and painfully. bit by tiny bit. get the stuffing out -- first at the nose. then slowly. hour by hour. day by day. then entire head was emptied. and VIOLA...2 months later Mr. Bill no longer had a voice...alll bets were off. he is now nothing but the shell of the toy he used to be. But he's still good to play tug of war with. I already got Mr. Dog another one but I'm saving it for Christmas."
8,"My 70 pound Lab loves this toy! She is a bit scared. but still interested enough to play with it. She is a chewer so I had to cut off the nose because she was trying to eat it. but other than that she has not chewed the toy up. She got one for Christmas and accidentally broke it when I threw it and she caught it and her tooth hit the box that makes the noise. I ordered 2 more for her. This is her favorite toy and it is durable."
8,"Our two Schnauzers love this toy. As with most toys. if they last six months. I'm happy.  It's been about six months and Mr. Bill is going strong.  Our Schnauzers are pretty smart.  They know their toys names and will retrieved them when called.  This one is called &#34;Oh No!&#34;. what Mr Bill calls out.  As soon as we say OH NO! they are searching for Mr Bill.When we travel. Mr Bill is one of the toys that they look for in their travel bag.  It has been a lot of fun for the dogs and for us too."
8,"Got this along with a few other toys a few weeks ago. This was clearly my dog's last choice. In fact. I didn't think he'd play with it at all. Eventually he started messing with it. so I was pretty thrilled. Of course. after a few days. he'd ripped some of the limbs open and stuffing was coming out. Overall. not one of his favorite toys. and doesn't seem very durable. The only squeaker in this thing is right in his stomach and it's hard to get to. I'm not even sure my dog even figured out it was in there. heck. I had trouble getting it. Get something else. Nothing special about sock monkey."
8,"Too cute! Takes me back.... I HAD to purchase it as soon as I saw it. I bought it for my dog b/c I knew she'd rip it to shreds and Mr. Bill would cry out at the same time. What a riot!!! My dog is a lab and would gently carry Mr. Bill around in her jowls. When she'd bite down. Mr. Bill cried out - cracks me up. She played tug-o-war with it with my sister's dog. too. Within a short period of time. Mr. Bill was sadly torn to shreds. but it was fun while he lasted!"
8,"Mr. little 8 month old female puppy loves this toy best of all.  It's unique 'oh noooo' sound is activated by pushing a spot on the tummy area and whenever she hears that she comes running ready to play.  A couple of times lately she has accidentally made its 'voice' go off too which she seemed to like also.  It's good to throw holding by one arm so it does 'cartwheels'.  I have two dogs actually. both under 10 pounds. and sometimes the two of them both grab and arm and play tug of war after I throw it which is fun too.  It's holding up very well but nonetheless I'm getting another because she likes it so much and I don't want to be left empty-handed if the other one quits working or if it just gets too dirty.  Me and my two dogs give it a definite thumbs up."
8,"I bought this toy because we have a running joke in my house basically saying that one of my three Pekingese loves to make toys with squeaks in them 'scream'.  He only plays with a toy that has a squeak in it until it doesn't squeak anymore. then moves onto the next.  I bought Mr. Bill for him. because I thought that he would love the 'Oh NO!' sound and sure enough... instant hit.  He carried Mr. Bill all over the house with him and we always knew where he was because we could hear the 'Oh NO!' sounds from all over the house.  Sadly. Mr. Bill has been retired. because he was taken out into the yard in the rain and got muddy and as I can't wash him with his battery pack in. I threw him away until I can buy another one.  Anyway. great toy!  Can't wait to get him back into our house!"
8,"Little did I know when I boughtMr. Bill. that when chewed. he cries out 'Oh nooooooo!' just like his SNL tv namesake!  Lady. my black lab absolutely loves this toy. When we gave her Mr. Bill two months ago. she forgot about her other toys for almost a month.  She has started playing with her other toys again. but this is still her favorite.The only drawback is. because of the 'Mr. Bill' sound-maker. it can only be surface-washed.  This is Lady's only toy that can't be tossed in the washer and dryer. but it's worth it to see my Lady with this toy.  I'm going to buy a few more. just to have on hand. in case Mr. Bill gets too dirty to surface wash.  I only wish they had a Mr. Hand dog toy to go with this.  ;-)"
8,"This particular Lambchop Toy is very well made. had a good loud squeaker in it. but most importantly is soft and comforting to my &#34;big baby&#34;. a 75 pound Labrador Retriever!! He had a smaller sized one about two years ago. and he loved it to death by sleeping on it. carrying it in his mouth. regular tooth pulling play time. and we finally had to retire the scraps of what was left (when he was not looking. of course....).  He looked for Lambchop for awhile. but he gave up. I was so discouraged that I couldn't find one ANYWHERE.  THEN. I was so pleased to see a new and BIGGER one on Amazon!!  The Price was outstanding. and my Labrador and his Lambchop are back to being cuddle buddies again.  This is a great dog toy.  I highly recommend it."
8,"This toy is just great! I originally bought one from Target (on sale for about $2.00) and my dog just feel in love w/ this him. He was playing with him. sleeping with him and he has to have Mr. Bill next to him at all times for next few days... Then somehow. we lost him.... so I had to buy him another Mr. Bill! He still loves to play with him and I think the sound he makes is just great! :) Totally recommend this product to any dog owners.. My dog is a 15 lb maltipoo btw"
8,"My little 3 pound maltese seems to like Mr Bill even tho. Mr Bill is almost bigger than him.  I only received Mr Bill today but it did not take my little pooch but a couple of minutes to bite Mr Bill's nose off.  Actually. I am glad he did it immediately and I noticed it immediately because he could have choked on it.  Seriously.  We pet owners love our animals and many of us love them like children and have little dogs that have to be watched carefully for hazardous items.  I strongly suggest when receiving Mr Bill. you go ahead and snip his nose off.  The nose on mine was on with one thread.  I am glad I ordered him as my dog likes it and funny to see him dragging around an item almost bigger than him.  Just keep in mine Mr Bill's nose."
8,"Seriously.  She was my Maltese puppy's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite.  I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning.  If you see him without Lambchop in sight. all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back.Lambchop is very well made.  She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy.  Not one seam has come loose. nothing except she's beginning to look pretty grungy and I'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward.  I've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works.And. uh. this is kinda sensitive and I'm not sure the pup would want me to share. but I think it's time to call the vet."
8,"Not the &#34;Ohhhhhh noooooooo!&#34; again! This toy gets to be very annoying because that's all it says but it's fun to see the look on the dog's face when Mr. Bill says it. This toy is not for destructive breeds or if the dog doesn't use the soft mouth. The box inside breaks if dog chews on it alone. It has stuffing in it but if you want and know how to. you just sew it back up. It's a fun toy but easy to break. This was the 3rd toy I've bought for the dog. She likes the &#34;Ohhhh noooo!!!&#34;"
8,"So. Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys. but he's hilarious. It's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over. because his 'Oh Nooooooooooo' squeaker makes everyone laugh. Our pitbull/rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days. but the squeaker has survived. and our dog is terrified of it. If he's doing something naughty. we pull out Mr. Bill's squeaker. and the &#34;Oh Noooooooo!&#34; stops him in his tracks. Worth the money. for sheer entertainment value."
8,"This is a durable and soft plush doggie toy - The dogs have a small basket full of toys. but Lambchop is one of their fav's to pick out of the box and tussle around.Has a couple squeaker's - so if that drives you crazy you may want to consider something different.Lambchop has also been machine washed and dried in the dryer (on low temp) several times and survived just fine.I have even purchased them a replacement for when the old one does bite the dust. they will have another -"
8,"We have a chewer in the family so I knew this wouldn't last long. Fortunately. our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off. Eventually. she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment. However. we did know this isn't a chew toy. The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed. We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his &#34;oh no&#34; cries. If they made a durable version of this I'd buy in a second."
8,"I recently got a puppy who is chewing on everything. except most of the puppy toys.  This is one of the exceptions.  He loves it.  His two favorite things are his Mr. Bill doll and his bully stick.  Both of them are holding up well.  If I activate the &#34;Oh. noooooo&#34; sound. he pounces on it and jumps around.  If he activates it in his mouth. he does a demonstration of the shaken baby syndrome and runs around the house.  I am amazed at the abuse this toy has taken.  If he ever destroys it. I will be getting him another.  As to the reviewer who bought it for his brother. not realizing it was a dog toy. I am sure any fan of Mr. Bill (and maybe even those who have never heard of Mr. Bill) would love to have this doll."
8,"The frog and duck toys held up so well that I decided to get the teddy bear (it is SO cute). Poor Mr. Bear doesn't last a day. My dog is 12 pounds and it is so incredibly easy to chew the limbs off these guys. My dog gnawed off the leg of one of the bears so we bought him a new one (what were we thinking?) He gnawed off another leg. We duct taped it back on and he gnawed through the duct tape. Cute toy for small pups if they aren't big chewers but my dog is just determined to eat this thing."
8,"My two young Siberian Huskies play with this.  My girl claims it as hers and often sleeps with it.  It fits her mouth about right. as she is on the small side for Huskies.  This is her 2nd teddy bear.  The 1st lasted about 1 year being squabbled over. pulled on. licked on. and gnawed.  It finally died when she figured out how to open the velcro opening in the back and chewed up the squeaker. the velcro. and other parts of the bear."
8,"My 2 yr old standard schnauzer will chew through anything.  I've been searching for a bully stick that will last more than 20 minutes with her. and still haven't found one.  For some reason though. she plays with this toy differently.  Handles it gingerly and is more interested in playing catch with herself than tugging and tearing.  That said. this is the first non-animal-part toy that has lasted more than 5 minutes.  It has become her favorite over the past 24 hours. which is 24 times longer than I thought it would last.Update: one eye is missing from the bear. but all the seams appear to be intact and she's still very engaged.  Very impressed with the item. although I'm sure it would be torn to shreds if it was her choosing."
8,"My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft. strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that. for my dog at least. is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!"
8,"I'm glad this toy has no stuffing in it. but for a few dollars more. the Kong Cozie is stuffed firmly and has a squeaker in the middle that lasts and lasts. My puppy has two varieties of the unstuffed Kong animals. one being this frog. They were correct to give you a free extra sqeaker. The toy. without stuffing. is very thin and flimsy. and the squeakers don't last. So far. the toy has not ripped. though. so I think the quality is decent for 5 bucks! But my 8 and 9 dollar Kong Cozies last as well and there is no need for extra squeakers."
8,"Having a 3 year old beagle that has destroyed toys in 3 minutes or less after receiving them. I'm always on the lookout for one she will like. and that will last longer than a bullrider does.This toy is one of my beagle's favorites! She fell in love with this critter!  She loves the squeaky in its head. and will carry it around in her mouth.  We don't let her have it when she's home alone. since I don't want her to get bored and chew her way through to the squeaker. but otherwise. it's held up wonderfully. We also don't let her play 'pull' with it. It comes with a replacement squeaker. which is nice.It's the perfect size for our beagle. and almost the perfect toy. If the size we received is 'medium'. I wouldn't order anything smaller for any dog except a Chihuahua.  I hope to find some more!"
8,"I received the bears (bought 2 of them) yesterday and I gave my 9 month old puppy Macie(Pug & JRT Mix) one of the bears. She had the pocket pulled out thru the head where the squeeky is within 30 min or so. She continued to play with the bear but also the pocket and the squeeky is just about destroyed....lol...she has a tendency to destroy every squeeky in a toy. so this doesnt surprise me. A little bit of stuffing came out - not sure what part of the bears body - but other then that she is still playing with the bear. Let's see how long the body will last before she shredds it to pieces. I'm still looking for a toy that she cannot destroy and I haven't found it yet. I think toymakers need to give me the toys to test and then if they survive they can be stamped 'Macie approved'"
8,"Our Apollo can't live without his Teddy! I've never had a dog so attached to his toy. He mangles it.runs with it and sleeps with it. Absolutely in love with it. It has held up better than any of his other toys...I just wish Amazon would bring back the large version of this toy. I bought 2 mediums in case his beloved large fails. This dog toy is the best and has taken 2 years of 95 lb. black Lab punishment...now that is a true test!!"
8,"I purchased this item mid January 2012. Its mid July now 2012 & the teddy has lasted so far with no issues. This is my dogs absolute favorite toy & she plays with it daily. It can be her chew buddy for hours on end & the squeaky noise just thrills her to no end. She has several other toys but this one is her first love. I was about to purchase another one right now as backup for when this one goes out. when I realized that I had not reviewed this & given it the credit it deserves. 5 STARS all day long."
8,"My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck.  Both of them she's had since she was a baby. 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition.  They last a long time!  She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all!  They are definitely two of her favorite toys!  They are very small though. don't buy them if you have a larger dog at all. I think they are just best for toy breed dogs. Bella is 6 pounds."
8,"My little dog likes these toys and I like the fact they have no stuffing.  They provide an extra squeaker but she will quickly kill both the squeakers and then just drag the little bear around with her.  This is her second one of this same toy because she liked the first one so well that it eventually just started to fall apart.  It did last for quite a while though as she normally can destroy a toy in a day.  She just kept looking for the stuff on this one which was funny because there is none."
8,"I have two dogs. one big and one small...they both love this toy.  Best of all. it's extremely durable.  Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I don't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart. stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker.  This one we've had for a couple weeks now. it's in their toy basket that they always have access to. they play with it pretty much daily and they've yet to destroy it.  Fantastic deal on this."
8,"I have a 25 pound mini goldendoodle.  I thought no way does she tear through this &#34;indestructible&#34; teddy bear.  Lasted all of 5 minutes and she had both ears off and the legs torn off... What a joke.  KONG should not be allowed to sell such garbage.  I read the reviews and thought &#34;well they must have a pitbull or a larger dog&#34;... NOPE. my 25 pound doodle ripped it in minutes.  Stay away from this one and go with the fire house toys."
8,"I have a Jack Russell Terrier that is a chew-maniac. I bought this bear hoping it would last a bit longer than most. based on good things I have heard about the Kong brand. It's been about a month and a half now. and he has ripped out the pouch for the replaceable squeaker (the squeaker itself was the 1st thing to go- in the first week). but the squeaker in the bear's head is still there. Aside from that. the rest of the bear is fully intact. My pup treats it with care. not biting as hard as usual when playing tug of war. He also plays fetch with it. but surprisingly does not chew it. I have seen him licking it and carrying it around though. When I get home from work. he often greets me at the door with a toy already in his mouth. and this bear is definitely one of his favorites."
8,"This stuffed frog is for &#34;small&#34; dogs. and I mean small. It is very small. and my dog is 12 lbs. and she loves it. She loves tiny toys. I estimate this toy is best for mini-pets like Chihuahua or small (under 10 lbs). I didn't actually see this one from Amazon because I ordered it for my best friend's new puppy who live in CA. I saw this at Petsmart and loved it. It is very cute. and from memory. it is about 3+ inches tall. The fur is soft. and I believe it also has a squeak in it."
8,"My American Eskimo absolutely loves this toy. The moment I gave it to him. he started chewing on it and shaking it around. It seemed sturdy. but I immediately started seeing random tufts of fur coming off of the toy. It's not a lot but I'll see a few strands here and there on the floor as a result of him chewing it up. It's only been a week and I'm already seeing signs of wear and tear on the toy. My dog loves everything about the toy. but I just wish it were more durable. At this rate I am not sure if it will last more than a month or so.Another comment is in regards to the squeaker. It comes with a replacement squeaker but I am not sure how to even get the one inside the bear out. In the toy I received. the squeaker is in the head of the bear and sewn shut."
8,"Oh she adores all her pets but the beaver even it is so small the adores and tries to hide this one and bury it in her bed so no one sees it to take it away from her.  Oh this is so cute being so small (The dukies are cute too - but ); she loves the beaver even more (maybe because of the tail?  Thanks so much KONG for this one.  Again NOT FOR A LARGE DOG  (TOO SMALL)  My dog only 4lbs 5oz."
8,"Okaye. this toy arrived in a little padded envelope.  It was tiny.  It does not look like the photo.  It is about the size of a mouse. only it's empty except for the squeaker.  I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily.... it's tiny!  It is good for a small dog puppy. not a larger breed puppy. unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse.  My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes.  She's 13 lbs.  I'm not crazy about the velcro and how  you can take the squeakers out. that's something I believe some dogs can easily figure out."
8,"As soon as I opened the Amazon box. Harri was right there. jumping up and grabbing the toy in her mouth and tearing off like a dog on fire. She seems to like the visual texture the dye-job provides. along with the actual texture of the fur.  I got her the large dog toy. wich seems to be just the right size for her. She's a 65 lb. Coonhound. which is not what I would consider to be a large dog. for those of you wondering about which size to get. So far. it seems to be a sturdy toy. but it has yet to be tested by a good game of tug-of-war between Harri and her sister. Sally.  It has held up very well to a lot of other plush toys. and I've found that I've had good luck with Dr. Noys in the past. so I'm more likely to take a chance on Dr. Noys compared to other plush toys."
8,"Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker. but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove. and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride. even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs. and it was perfect for him. but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting. my nails."
8,"As a big fan of the Dr. Noys toy line. I was quite disappointed when this bear arrived. After searching in the bottom of the box for it. I found it drowning in the peanuts (just kidding). This size is seriously more appropriate for something like a Yorkie or chihuahua. It's too small for our 20lb. mix. and definitely not ten inches tall as the description stated. Still. our dog has tossed it around. and I've found Dr. Noy's toys to be quite durable."
8,"My shih tzu puppy loves this tiny kong toy.  He's able to squeak it easily and gets great joy out of that.  Larger squeaker toys are difficult for him to squeak.  This is perfect for small puppies who are teething and still have their baby teeth.  I also have the tiny frog like this one.  If your small dog or puppy has a hard time making his or her toys squeak they will love this.  It also comes with a replacement squeaker and you can remove the squeaker easily through the velcro opening to wash the toy. The velcro seals tightly.I see some other reviewers dogs have destroyed this toy. it is tiny so keep that in mind before ordering.  It definitely is a small dog toy (slightly smaller than the length of your hand when you include the flat tail)."
8,"This product isn't quite as high quality as it looks in the picture above. and I'd highly recommend you take a close look at its dimensions before purchasing it (if this is a 'medium.' I can't imagine how tiny the 'small' must be).  I'd also only recommend this item for supervised play (not. as I'd hoped. as a snuggly toy to leave in my puppy's crate overnight).  The body of the toy is only the length of my index finger. and I'm concerned that any larger breed puppy will rip this thing to shreds in minutes if you let him.  Oh well."
8,"I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy. She loved it. and unlike a lot of toys. she was able to make it squeak very easily. The body of the toy (minus tail) is about the size of a small mouse (real). so you wouldn't want to get this for a big dog. It came with an extra squeaky. which I loved. Unfortunately. our larger. chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it. so the old squeaky is broken and the new one won't stay in.  I might have to order another one. it was such a good toy for the puppy!"
8,"This product really works well. I have a 7 year old pup who was starting to show signs of weak hips and stiffness. I could see that her joints were a bit stiff because it took her a while to sit or lay down.  However. after a few weeks on this product. she's sitting much more quickly and she doesn't struggle with sitting or laying down.The downside to this product is that she doesn't like it!!  Its a chalky pill that she spits out every time I give it to her.  I have to coax her with a treat but its starting to get a bit tedious to bribe her every day.  Good thing I bought the small bottle!  Once its done (10 more to go!). I'm switching to something more palatable."
8,"...between this product and Advantix. depending upon which product is priced less expensive at the time. That's because both work well at fighting fleas for approximately 3 1/2 weeks. I don't know whether it's because I have a dog and four cats. but we have to reapply flea meds every month. so claims that this product breaks the cycle completely either isn't accurate. or . . . well. I can't fathom why it wouldn't break the cycle completely. We apply the product on all cats and our dog simultaneously. so you'd think that the fleas would die off permanently. Still. it does seem to kill the adults very quickly. as any scratching that took place prior to application immediately stopped after application."
8,"This year I decided to go cheap and purchase a less expensive brand of flea control... well I certainly paid for it with a nice infestation of fleas. even on my inside cat! I went back to this more expensive (but certainly more reliable) brand and the fleas have completely gone. I noticed with the cheaper brands they have a lot of liquid and it takes forever for the big greasy spot on the back of the cat's neck to try. How unsightly! But with this I couldn't even tell if I was putting any on them. it was so discreet. I will definitely be sticking with this from now on."
8,"As strictly related to shipping. it arrived several days late. which causes me concern with a product that should be kept in a controlled environment. Amazon shipping is usually spot-on. but this was not one of those times. Frustrating to wait for something that we needed for our pets. So I suggest ordering ahead of your actual need.We have 2 indoor cats that had what I would call a minor flea problem. The initial dose seemed to do the job. And unlike some treatments I've used it was well tolerated. No irritation to the skin. etc.We had a recurrence of fleas just over a month later and had to re-apply the product. I know fleas are hard to get rid of completely so I'm not totally surprised. I was hoping that the first dose would end the problem. seeing as the fleas weren't that bad.I shopped around and Amazon had the best price. So really the only thing bugging me was the mishandling of the shipping."
8,"If you're cat is an indoor cat. yes this product will work well for you. But if your cats go outside like mine. FORGET IT! Yes Advantage kills fleas that are on your pet immediately. But it does not keep them flea free for 30 days. like they advertise. I've tried Advantage on my cats a few times. The fleas that were on my cats did die within 12 hours. But within ONE WEEK they were biting and scratching again like before. I'm picking fleas off of them after only a week and a half. If the product wasn't so expensive. it might be worth the money. But don't waste your money. because it only works well for a few days. Frontline works a lot better."
8,"Many products are not safe... like Hartz. and made my cat sick.  Advantage works great on all my cats. and they are  indoors at night and out playing most of the day. I alternate cats when I use Advantage. and apply it only every 3 weeks to ONE cat at a time in the winter.... still no fleas! In the summer I use it every 4 weeks as suggested. My daughter has 8 cats and a dog. and uses only Advantage for flea control.  It works better than anything else out there.  It's so nice not to have flea bites all around my ankles. or fleas in my home !!"
8,"I don't care what the box says-Advantage does NOT last a month.  In two weeks the fleas will return.  I found that flea protection is best when you use HALF DOSE (0.4 ml per cat-this contains 0.8 ml per bottle). applied twice a month.  For me this has worked perfectly. Now if you have indoor cats. you most likely will not need to treat your cat all the time. Use a FLEA COMB a few times a week to monitor the presence of fleas. If you see one single flea. get them all treated. but use HALF DOSE. That may all your indoor cat needs.Once in a blue moon my indoor cats need to be treated. and this works well.Also please vacuum your house. The flea eggs and fleas cannot and will not survive in vacuum cleaner bags. and is the best way to deflea your house. and include your furniture :-)"
8,"Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective.  We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb.  No more fleas on the cats. no more fleas on my ankles. no more fleas period.  You'll need one dose per cat per month.  I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time.  This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store.  Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock.  The box was wrinkled. but the contents were in perfect shape.  Paid an excellent price. I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture. and the shipping was free!  Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
8,"I put this on my cat 4 times over a 4 month period. (He is a healthy 3 year old) Each time. he reacted more negatively than the time before. Last dose. he acted as if it was stinging him. and he was aggressive and in a bad mood for 2 days. I looked up information regarding counterfeit flea meds and although the vials do have the right wording--the epa # on the vials is one of two epa #'s that have been counterfeited. I am not taking anymore chances with the last two vials. I am throwing it out. Guess I will have to buy from a more reputable source in order to feel safe about this."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
8,"I saw fleas after having been using an oral medication for my dogs--it seemed to have STOPPED working..threw the kids in the tub...bathed them - then RAN to PetsMart and bought the Advantage....in less than 24 hours my dogs STOPPED scratching and slept the night.  I have ordered their next doses from Amazon...but at the first sign of the fleas I wanted IMMEDIATE action..LOLand per another reviewer I did in fact notice a whiff of 'altered' breath on one of my (small) dogs---but it was't awful--but definitely 'changed'"
8,"After two applications I saw no improvement on my puppy. Then I found out online that it is ineffective if it's applied within 48 hours before and after the bathing. Shouldn't this information be on the box if it's so important? I called the manufacturer and was 'serviced' by very argumentative representative. I don't think the product is worth the money at all. A friend of mine who used it also see no effect on her dog. You are better off buying from Hartz. At least their products are cheap and customer service is superb."
8,"I decided to buy Bayer Advantage because Frontline Plus was not killing fleas for a whole month. after 2 weeks I noticed fleas on my animals. So when the month was up. I bought Bayer Advantage it works great. for a whole month. killing all fleas. I did have to reapply 2 weeks later because it said so on the box in case of severe infestations to do so. I did so because my animals are allergic to flea bites. I will buy this again. Its a great value here on amazon. Much better than Frontline."
8,"I previously used Advantage to take care of my cat's flea problem. and it worked immediately - but my cat absolutely hated the smell which lingered on her body.  She would howl and run off when she saw me approaching with the Advantage vial. and I hate being the villain once a month. So now I've switched to Program.  It's kind of a pain mashing the tablet and mixing it up into wet catfood.  Also. it takes a couple of days to take effect.  But - it does work well. and my cat is very happy. I will definitely buy Program tabs again."
8,"There's a good article comparing the flea products: [...]The condition of the surrounding and pets all need to be considered before choosing the right product that suits your needs. I have a cat and dog. My dog is a flea magnet and the only product that works for him is Revolution and I love the fact that it's a heart worm prevention med also. However I put the cat on Program since she is an indoor cat and I feel more comfortable using this on her because my dog licks my cat but not vice versa. I use the Greenie pill pockets to wrap the tablet and has no problem at all enticing her to eat it. So far this combination works perfect for me. Every animal is different. It takes a little trial and error to find the best product for that animal specifically."
8,"I used Advantage for years on our outdoor cats and always dreaded the monthly trial of applying it.  It was messy. smelled. and neither the cats nor I enjoyed it.  I started using Program a couple of months ago and couldn't be happier.  There's a lot of liquid in the monthly dose. but I mix it up with some wet food and the cats don't even know it's there.  They gobble it up and DONE.  One cat is 8 lbs and the other about double that. and neither has experienced any negative side effects.  Since Program targets flea eggs. we combine it with the Capstar tablets to address the adult fleas. as well.  It's made a huge difference. and I'm gratified to see the cats relax in comfort rather than constantly scratching and biting."
8,"I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house.  I tried to mix the suspension with their food (I tried dry food and wet treats)... they sniffed it and walked away.  I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth.  It was messy. they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it.  I'm sticking with Frontline Plus...much easier for my cats."
8,"Program is the safest long lasting flea treatment for pets-- I used to work in a veterinary hospital and I have seen many cats have serious reactions to  Advantage and Frontline. which are topical pesticides.Read the inserts for Advantage and Frontline. it says that they are NOT safe for sick animals. young kittens. etc. etc. My cat is allergic to both Frontline and Advantage. Frontline gave him a lump in his neck and Advantage gave him a bald spot where I applied it. and he kept trying to lick the spot.Program is super safe-- you can put it in a dish and mix it with tuna and your cat will eat it right up. You can use it with Capstar (also super safe. but not long lasting) to kill live fleas if your cat picks one up. This is the best monthly flea control to keep your cat safe and healthy! I have used it for almost a decade and I will not use any other product on my cat."
8,"I first discovered these on Facebook.  The lady who manufactures them has a really funny FB page that I recommend you check out.  These bags are great.  I never go on walks with the dogs without a couple in my pocket (and often an extra one or two to share with those dog parents who just maybe didn't think about the fact that they should pick up their dog's business).They come in different sizes and a clean one can even double as a portable water bowl for your furry friend.I like that they are biodegradable so I am not adding to the landfill problem.You can use them to put your cat's litter box deposits in as well."
8,"Mutt Mitts are the best waste bags I've found. They are much sturdier (you won't stick your hand through) and the double layer at the bottom of the mitt means even more strength and protection from unpleasant poop pick up. These are pretty good sized. so it's easy to tie and fabulous for extra large breeds down to small breeds.The packaging is well designed too. The two holes at top allow you to hang the bags near the door or out of site behind a door or panel. Two thumbtacks easily hold up the package and allow you to tear off bags as you need them. A++ product. If you have dogs. you really should try these baggies!"
8,"I hated these bags!  Yeah I know. I stand alone in this.  But I do hate them!  Wen I clean up dog poop. I also clean up any remnants of poop on the grass. sometimes pulling bits of grass out on purpose so as to leave nothing behind (as best as I can).  These bags make that impossible.  There is no give in these bags for detailed work such as described.  These bags are like doing surgery with hockey goalie gloves on.  So I am back to standard bags which work great (I prefer Bags on Board - come off roll clean. never fail/tear/etc.. can pick up more than one pile (we've smaller dogs). etc...."
8,"We have an 85-pound dog and use 1.000 bags per year (3 per day). There is no denying how good these are. as described by other reviewers. It's the most comfortable way to handle an unpleasant task.What bothers me though is the extra plastic and expense involved with these. Taking into account environmental and economic factors. I prefer to use the smaller and thinner120 Earth Rated Dog Waste Bags. Lavender Scented. 8 Rolls. 120-Count.So what we do is keep both items on hand in a fanny pack. For the biggest or messiest 'jobs'. we use Mutt Mitts. For typical 'duty'. the above linked product is very good. That way everyone wins!"
8,"This quality spray did exactly as advertised. I have a cat. who likes to go outside his litter box. and an active toddler who loves to drop food and color on our light-colored carpet.  I used this Bissell Pet Stain and Odor spray as directed. generously spraying a stained area. blotting and covering with a wet rag. and leaving it alone for several hours.  I am pleased to say that even some long-time stains that I grown to live with are starting to fade considerably or disappear entirely.As another reviewer pointed out. this product does not work on ink. My toddler colored on a portion of our den carpet with an ink pen. and this spray was not very effective on that area. However. as promised. it did eliminate virtually all of my cat stains throughout the house. I have no complaints and would easily recommend this to others."
8,"If you have pets then you should have the BISSELL PET STAIN & ODOR PRE-TREATER SPRAY on hand for those occasional accidents. Even though my Shiba just turned 2-years old and she's potty trained. she'll still has accidents. The other day she ate something and threw up a little and so I used the BISSELL PET PRE-TREATER to spray the area. after wiping up the mess.I let it soak for a few minutes then used theBISSELL Spotbot Pet Handsfree Spot and Stain Cleaner with Deep Reach Technology. 33N8Ato power clean the area and it works well together. though the SPOTBOT machine works fine on its own.I think the spray is the same type of solution that you use in the SPOTBOT. so I think this can be used even if you don't own the machine itself.Definitely keep a bottle on hand just in case."
8,"I use it to pre-treat my carpet in heavy stained spots. but it's also VERY handy for when my puppy has accidents here and there. Instead of cleaning my carpet all over again (no way. it takes too much time). I just spray this and clean it off. I think this works better than the concentrated 2X formula. not to mention its scent is even better. If you own a puppy or a pet that isn't fully housebroken yet. buy it. You'll be glad you have something that cleans your carpet easily and fast without the use of a cleaner."
8,"I've used Nature's Miracle for years on pet stains. and found it to be the best at removing stubborn smells. but I'm always willing to try something new.I tried this Bissell Pre-Treat on some old upholstered chairs my husband purchased at a garage sale for $5. He was going to use them out in his shop so he didn't mind a few stains. but I really minded the old-dog-urine smell!After using the pre-treat as recommended. I proceeded to clean the chairs using my Bissell Spot Bot and was pleasantly surprised with the results. The chairs looked nearly new. only two small stains remained on the light colored material. Unfortunately. the smell was more stubborn. and required a re-wash and application of Nature's Miracle to finally make it disappear for good."
8,"I typically pre-treat most stains prior to carpet cleaning.  This is a ok pre-treat but I likeBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery. 22 ozbetter.  I have beige carpet and this cleaner seems to occasionally leave a residue that leaves my carpet with a pink tinge.  I've been able to remove the substance by waiting until the spot dries and going over the spot with the carpet cleaner a second time.  For lighter carpets. I would recommend theBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery. 22 oz."
8,"My German Sheperd LOVES this!!He is crazy about playing ball and the Chuck it! makes me happy to play. No more slobbery balls to throw.Your dog drops the ball at your feet (hopefully) and all you need to do is slap the Chuck It on the ball and toss again!Care must be taken if using in a fenced enclosure--the ball can travel quite a distance when &#34;chucked&#34;. I have gone into neighbors yards several times to retrieve an overthrown ball.This is a great toy for man and beast!!The rubber balls that are used with the Chuck It are sturdy and have stood up to the chomping of my dog's jaws--which have reduced other balls to rubble.The white ball actually does glow in the dark if you have a dog who is in to night time play."
8,"I wish I would have bought this a year ago. I used to walk past this in the store and think. 'Wow I should try that!' But the 20.00 price tag always turned me away. I already had toys to play fetch with and my dog loved the frisbee so I wasn't sure if he would take to the ball the same way. I saw this on amazon and had to buy it. 10.00 was a steal. Now that I have tried it I would spend the 20.00 that the big stores ask for this. I am very happy with my purchase and it shipped very fast!"
8,"A BALL THROWING ARM EXTENSION! It does best overhand. my uncle mike who was in Vietnam and doesn't have much use of his arms after the agent orange issues he has. can use this thing like no problem. hes the reason i got it. I figured if my uncle could chuck-it 50 yards i could do a little more. honestly i only get it about 50-60 myself.I bought a set a balls definitely buy the ones from chuckit. normal balls work fine but when they get slimey the release early. plus my lab skins and splits tennis balls down the seem in about 3 mins... she has yet to destroy a chuckit ball. but i also dont give her much of a chance to do so.Great for dogs that like to run. as long as they dont run off! lolits been over a year now and the original set of balls are still good. the chuckit rides in the trunk just fine... i love it"
8,"My dog's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt! ball.  She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her.  After a while though. it gets slippery. so when I saw this Launcher I wasn't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try.  Well. it does work!  It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball. and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand.  Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat. or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it."
8,"We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts. my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one 'Chuckit' ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water."
8,"The Chuckit Launcher is a necessity if you have a dog that enjoys the game of fetch.  I have always known about this product but considered it for the lazy man.  My yellow lab has enough energy to make a game of fetch feel like pitching nine innings in the big leagues.  It would get to the point where I would have to ice my shoulder.  I eventually invested in one of these and now use it regularly.  Once you get the hang of the throwing motion you can launch the ball incredible distances with very little effort.It came with a fuzzy tennis ball which I eventually replaced with a Chuck glow ball.  This rubber ball is much better then any tennis ball and glows in the dark so I can use it at night.I gave this 5 stars because it has now become an essential tool to deal with my dogs energy.  Keeping her exercised makes life a lot easier in the house."
8,"I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years. and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable. inexpensive. and a great aid to throwing balls. especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit. though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over. and you need not touch a slobbery. muddy. grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners. and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!"
8,"We already had a green chuck it about the same size. We got a second one so we could each have one in our car. Our dog gets so excited when she sees the chuckit that she's a excited mess all the way to the park. So now we keep a chuckit in each of our cars. out of sight. so that we can always be prepared to play ball with our dog. The chuckit pro is nice. The grip is a nice touch and this one flings the ball further than the regular chuckits with not much effort. Maybe it's weighted differently? Anyway- we fight over who gets to keep the chuckit pro in their car."
8,"There's something about the Chuckit that drives my dog nuts.  She'll bark at anyone holding it who doesn't throw the ball immediately.  Plus. if you get the end of an empty Chuckit near her mouth. it's a chew toy.  So. it's a Chuckit and a Chewit.  This thing can keep her entertained for hours.The Jr (now called 18M) is perfect for active small dogs or medium dogs. and when you lose the ball that came with it (and you will when another dog runs off with the ball). the Jr will fit regular tennis balls."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
8,"I've had one of the original chuckit 26-inch launchers for a long time and love it.  The only real complaint I had with it was that the handle wasn't very ergonomic and sometime slipped out of my hand on a strong throw.  When I saw this 25M. it looked like it could be really nice.  It's OK .. the handle is nice and works about as well as the old one.  The issue is that the ball cup is too loose.  Perhaps it's a decent enough fit for the fuzzy tennis-ball type balls but the rubber chuckit balls like the whistler and the glow-in-the-dark are too loose.  I have to bend the cup closed a bit after every few throws or the ball will slip out at the wrong point in the throw.  Admittedly. I give the thing a good heave .. typically throw the ball a good 160-200 feet depending on the wind .. but I never had that problem with the old chuckit."
8,"My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate. so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband. however. has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!"
8,"Are you sick and tired of picking up slobbery. wet. drool dripping tennis balls? Then the answer to your problems is in the Chuck It. I can spend hours at the part with this toy playing with me dog. It's very sturdy and easily grabs the ball from the ground. It did take some time to be able to adjust how I threw the ball with it so that it didn't just fly into the ground (I put too much arm swing into it). This toy helps you throw the ball farther than with just your arm and keeps your hands clean. The Chuck It does come in a few different sizes also. depending on the size of your dog. It also comes in a variety of colors. Something else that I like about this dog toy is that the balls come in BRIGHT colors so I never loose them!If you have a dog that likes to play fetch with tennis balls. or a dog full of energy this is the toy for you!"
8,"I bought one of these and ended up using it for the neighbor dogs more than my own because of the fact that he would not bring it back to me to throw again. Recently. at the age of 2 he has now realized the point of fetch and loves how far I can throw the ball with this. He plays until he can barely catch his breath. so I have stop and give him breaks. otherwise he would just keep going. Also keeps the slober off you and on the ball where it belongs."
8,"I bought this for my very enthusiastic lab who was OBSESSED with chasing balls. She LIVED to chase a ball. This one was more economical. I didn't have to pay shipping due to Amazon Prime and it was quick delivery. Unfortunately. Maggie passed away at the age of 3 in her prime. She passed due to complications delivering puppies. The breeder offered me another dog. We will be going to get her on Saturday. She will be enjoying it in Maggie's memory. Our new dog won't replace Maggie but she'll fill a hole. God Bless you Maggie !"
8,"Both of my Pit Bulls adore this toy.  It's a little shorter than the regular one. but still goes a good distance.  It holds regular tennis balls and anything that size.  When I first started bringing my new dog to the dog park. the Chuck-It was my way to get his attention. and for him to follow me to the exit to leave so I didn't have to chase him down.  It's like it hypnotizes my dogs.  Gives them fabulous exercise too!"
8,"I have an 8-pound toy poodle whose passion is fetching balls.  Her mouth is so small she could not get the regular chuckit ball in her mouth and carry it very far.  I ordered this mini-chuckit and though the ball is a little bigger than her very small balls. it works fine and she catches it in her mouth as it's heading toward earth. I have noticed that this mini-chuckit hurles the ball much farther than the regular. which is great because she loves to go far to fetch it.  We use this launcher several times a day and we never get tired of it.  The ball it came with got trashed within a month so I bought Tuff Balls to replace it.  We absolutely love this launcher.  It's fabulous for the beach.  You can't go wrong with this if your little toy dog loves fetching."
8,"We bought this to use in our backyard as it said it was a smaller version to throw the balls a shorter distance.  They weren't kidding.  We have a full-size chuckit and this junior version and this really doesn't throw nearly as far.  I'd say the average adult could throw just as far as this. so we've kind of rotated this out of usage and just use the full-size if going to a park and simply throw the ball by hand if we're in the backyard.  This was a waste of money as you can just use the full-size for shorter distances too and simply not throw the ball as far."
8,"My 8 month old golden loves to chase balls and I have bad rotator cuffs. so I was hoping this would really help me. My backyard is fairly large (1/3 acre) so I expected I would have no problem keeping the ball in our fenced area - wrong! If I use slightly too much &#34;oomph&#34; it goes over the fence. and if I scale it back a titch too much. it goes into the ground 6 feet in front of me. I've had a lot more success out at the dog park where I can let it fly and not worry that I'll send my 60 pound puppy crashing into a fence."
8,"I originally had a large chuck it but it wore out and would not hold the ball in well.So I went to amazon looking for something that would last longer. and found this...I took a chance on it because I did not see this specific model launcher on the chuckit website and the stock photo is photo shopped (shows 2 different model numbers) at the time of purchase there were no reviews.It works and feels a lot less flimsy/flexible than the orange one I originally bought from pet food express...this does however make it a lot more work to launch the ball further..but hopefully it wont wear out."
8,"We have a standard poodle with a ball fetish. She loves (and this is not a strong enough word) tennis balls or anything that can be thrown and returned. We have a large backyard but when I throw the tennis ball (without the Chuckit). she just looks at me with an exasperated. 'Really?' The Chuckit allows me to throw the ball clear across our (did I mention large?) yard. I can throw it for a long time without ever getting a sore shoulder or arm and the BEST PART is that I never have to touch a slobbery. muddy ball. Picking the ball up with the Chuckit is very easy. as long as the dog isn't attacking the ball while I'm trying to get it off the ground.This is a highly recommended product. We've had three (ours stay outside and get chewed on and bent by the kids at some point). And I will continue to buy them as others wear out."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I've been told I 'throw a ball like a girl.'  It must be true. because when I throw a ball it doesn't go very far (by the way I'm a woman. not a man).  I can't throw very far with this launcher. either. but I know they work well because I watch my neighbor use his Chuck It Ball Launcher for his retriever-type dog and he can the ball to go REALLY far.  I'm up to about 30' myself with the Chuckit. which I admit isn't very far.  But then again. my dog doesn't really 'retrieve' balls anyway. she just runs around with them in her mouth until I go and take the ball from her. so it's just as well.  But whatever. this launcher makes my ball-throwing time with my dog more fun."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
8,"My family adopted a Golden Retriever who loves to fetch.  Problem is she's a slobbery mess. and I hated touching the balls.  I also can't throw very far when compared to how fast she runs. so games were short. and she wasn't exercising her full potential.Not any more!  I can probably throw the ball 250 feet now. and my dog is huffing and puffing in a few minutes!  I usually play with two balls. one she is fetching. and the other is ready to go when she comes back.  She wasn't very fond of the tennis ball that comes with the launcher. however I ordered some of the orange chuck-it balls and she's doing well with those.  You'll definitely need a large open area to use this though!Definitely worth the money."
8,"I had this item in my cart when I realized it might not be the length handle I was looking for. I read the current reviews and did an online search and scrolled through several pages looking at various websites and found out the 18' handle on the small ball launcher was a 2007 model that has been discontinued. only the 14' handle is available. I have one small ball launcher w/an 18' handle and I'm going to guard it very carefully! I agree w/the other reviews that the shorter handle in the small ball launcher is harder to throw and harder to control and not in the 'fun' category. On the other hand the 18' handle for the small balls is completely indispensible! The manufacturer is Canine Hardware and I suggest we send them lots of emails requesting they return the small ball launcher w/the 18' handle. The reviews are correct. the 18' handle is no longer made and ALL small ball launchers are 14' handles."
8,"We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort. you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort. it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over. as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run."
8,"We were having a grand time with this toy. and my dog enjoyed running the extra distance.  That was until I handed it over to my boyfriend who &#34;Chucked it&#34; as hard as he could and our tennis ball was lost forever... Ok. so that's not really a problem since you can put whatever kind of tennis ball you want in there. but buyer beware: You must understand physics to avoid losing your dog's favorite tennis ball or possibly chucking a ball into a passing car.  It really depends on where you live."
8,"My pup is in love with this. I had never seen the small launchers in stores however I had the balls so I looked it up online and found this. It is more difficult then it looks and it takes a bit to get use to throwing the ball with this but my pooch is happy now that I can throw his ball much much farther. I was never a good pitcher. Whenever he sees his chuck it he gets excited and starts whining. In fact... He gets excited if he sees anyone's chuck it at the dog park. and that person. has earned a new 7 lb shadow. Brody was more of a keep away dog he would never drop the ball for me easily. So I'd launch the ball with this and feed him a treat in the chuck it launcher itself. Now he gives the ball up every time I have it up for a seamless game of fetch."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
8,"We have a 8 month old male Doberman that needs lots of exercise and likes to chase a ball unless he gets distracted by a pretty little Boxer. Dalmatian or whatever other female is within 500 feet of him. We have a huge dog park that opened recently near our home and this has been a activity for us to enjoy there. This size might be overkill because you can really send the ball flying but with a little practice it works great and gives you plenty of options. My wife sends the ball about 50 yards and she is petite. I like the fact that I don't have to pick up a ball with slobber all over it anymore.On a side note I recommend using the Chuckit medium Ultra Balls because they are easy to clean and last longer than the fuzzy balls."
8,"I really like this launcher.  It works really well. but I'm thinking of someday buying the longer one.  I opted on this one as the long one indicated it threw farther.  I didn't want to launch it so far I'd lose the ball or end up chasing my dog to get him to come back. so for the length of the throw is perfect and it's very easy to snatch the ball up for continued throwing.  My significant other is 6'1&#34; so he has to do some bending to pick up the balls which is okay for him. but the intention had been to make it easier for him.  One thing I've noticed is that this does not put the stress on my shoulder that thowing by hand thowing does.  This makes our dog. Diego. very happy because he can play and play and play."
8,"sure. i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner)!! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can! Which means my doggie can run much farther too! Which means she gets tired faster! and goes to sleep sooner!! this is the best thing ever created!!!! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way) she goes insane!! it also doubles as a water bowl. one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot. I had my camelbak on but i didn't bring her water bottle. I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that. pretty nifty. eh?"
8,"My dog was totally uninterested in the Chuckit balls. so this did not get used a lot.  He does like to fetch his squeaky balls and his crunchy balls. but something about the Chuckit balls (I had 4 different kinds) left him bored. When I did use it. I could not get the balls to fly far like I've seen others.  I'm guessing it was me. not the Launcher.  My dog did. ultimately. like the Chuckit Launcher.  One day. when I wasn't looking. he chewed it up.  It is now one of his favorite chew toys.  Given how long it is lasting. it wasn't such a bad deal."
8,"Fantastic throwing device!  I received this 26M Chuckit in great condition and on time.  The first time I used it I almost threw the ball over the trees into the horse pasture next door.  It is easy to throw the tennis ball close to 75 yards.  This thing really launches the ball with very little effort.  Great for these light weight tennis balls which always seem to bother my elbow when I throw them.  I may actually order the shorter version to reduce overthrown balls. Works great to pick the ball up also.  The ball snaps right into place just as advertised."
8,"My now 9 month old 35 lbs. part Bulldog/ Belgian Malinois pup chews every toy he (and my other dogs and cat) gets.  This was no exception.  I bought Chuckit Tennis balls in hopes that he wouldn't be able to rip it apart.  He ripped them apart very easily.  My 20 lbs. beagle/dachshund mixed dog absolutely adores fetch and retrieve but he started chewing them. too.  As any pug owners knows. the pug wouldn't touch these and doesn't retrieve or fetch anything that is not foodIf you have a chewer. get the Chuck it Fetch it Balls instead of the tennis balls.  I have each kind available and love them all and they are all still intact."
8,"I love the Chuckit!  Let's me throw a ball MUCH farther. for my fetch-crazy dogs. than I can throw by hand!  Also saves me from having to pick up slimy wet balls. since my dogs will drop them at my feet and I just pop the throwing stick over the ball and heave it again.  These replacement balls work perfectly with the throwing stick - my only complaint is that the balls are not as durable as real tennis balls.  The balls that came with the original throwing stick split in half under the abuse my Cattle Dog gave them.  Now he's a senior citizen and has no interest in fetching - so maybe these balls will last longer with the other two Aussie-mix dogs."
8,"I ordered three of these and this item is great. I own an 11 week old German Shepherd puppy that loves to chase a tennis ball and she grows bigger every single day. I was afraid that if I got a ball that was 'her' size that I would not be able to keep it as she grows. but these seem to be just the right size. she can carry it around in her mouth just fine - she was carrying regular ones at 7 weeks!They float and they also bounce great like a normal tennis ball. just bigger. Only time will tell about the durability. but these seem like the right size for large dog breeds to play fetch with in and out of the water."
8,"We have a lab/great dane mix who is obsessed with chewing and chasing balls.  Big stong jaws and teeth on that girl [Abby]  This is about the 10th different ball I have provided her and this is the best.  Its been a couple of months and she is still in love with this ball.  I think she broke through the ball with her teeth [which she always does] but she is keeping it intact.  We put all her balls that survive in one pile and she will go and pick this one out for special attention.  Bigger than a tennis ball. but not too big.  very durable.  easy to throw.  she can't get it as slimy as a regular tennis ball.  Its a good deal"
8,"These are the tennis-type balls that come with the original Chuckit thrower.  They're OK. but they don't go the distance or have the 'mouth appeal' of the Ultra Chuckit ball.  My yard is littered with these balls and none of my dogs will play with them. only the Ultra ball or various Planet Dog balls.  Plus. according to The Whole Dog Journal. these colorful tennis balls are laden with chemicals that aren't healthy for your dog.  Spend the money on Ultra ChuckIt balls; They cost more but last longer. fly farther. and are easy to clean.This product has been rated by two young Labs (brothers). a Golden Retriever and a Beagle."
8,"My dog loves fetch and I am a huge fan of the Chuckit! launcher. however the tennis balls only seemed to last about a week tops.  The felt disintegrates and then the rubber ball splits into two pieces.  I thought this was just how life was going to be: forever buying these balls for our launcher.  Then a friend told me that they just use regular tennis balls so I tried it.  I bought a pack of 10 cheap-o tennis balls for the same price as I was paying for 2 Chuck it balls and three weeks later we're still using on our first ball- amazing!  It fits perfectly in the launcher and still has felt and bounce.  Thank you. Chuckit! for making the medium sized launcher a standard tennis ball size.  I will happily buy another launcher if my current one ever wears out. but I won't waste my money on these tennis balls."
8,"I have two bichon dogs ages 7 and 5.  My five year old has clicking joints and I thought I'd try these.  So far they're still clicking but both dogs LOVE these treats. I think I'll have to get joint food as well as the treats.  Treats worked before alone.  For the price and how the dogs like these I plan on reordering them.  I break them in half most of the time since they are nice size even with the 'small' size."
8,"First Impression: Nutri-Vet heard about my website! They decided to send me a bag of their Peanut Butter flavored biscuits. Well what dog doesn't love peanut butter??? Right now my hips are fine. but I'm a young pup at a mere 13 months. I'm sure as time progresses I'll run into some sore joints. just like all large breed dogs do. So I'm happy to know that there is something out there that can help. and tastes as good as this!Conclusion: Tastes great. no animal bi-products. resealable bag. and it tastes like PB!"
8,"The feeding instructions for these biscuits are two/day for 30# dogs.  While it says for &#34;Small and Medium Dogs&#34;. it's strictly for medium dogs; I have two 10# dogs. which means I had to break these into thirds.  And when I tried to break these. these didn't break clean and tended to crumble.  So while they seem to help my dog with her knee issues. I would NOT recommend for small dogs.  If you have a 15# dog. you can break these in half.  Great product for a 30# dog. but not for 10# dogs."
8,"I have 2 cats and one is getting chubby. plus I'm tired of always feeding them regularly.  I needed this for when I was out of town anyway. This is great for feeding them a certain amount of food without overfeeding them. I don't plan on using it for canned food with the ratings I saw on the site. Besides. it's not vacuum packed to keep the canned food from spoiling and the ice packs are kind of cheap on the bottom---a gel that lasts longer than frozen water in them would work better and the manufacturer should have thought of that."
8,"My only complaint is that you need to pop the whole center out before you refill it. or you mess up the timer programming.  It's not super easy to pop back in. but not too hard either.When you pop the timer mechanism back in. make sure you line up the little prong on the timer with the notch on the plastic dish cover's center hole.  If you don't. it won't fully lock into place and kitty might be able to get into the hidden pockets.My cats have stopped screaming at me when it comes close to dinner time; instead. they just wait patiently for the dish to open.  They took to it instantly!"
8,"As far as I can tell. it works as advertised. We only used it once while we were gone from the house and my cat didn't eat (stress I think). We have to use wet food though and the ice pack didn't last as long as I'd hoped. We were gone overnight and the ice wasn't cold when we got home. we threw out the food that the cat didn't eat. So if someone can come in to change the ice. it would work. There must be a way to do it where it would last longer. but we've just had someone come feed the cat instead. If someone knows of a way. please let me know!"
8,"This product is a great buy for the money.  I shopped around a lot and couldn't find anything to compare.  This is the second one I bought.  I've had the first one almost a year and it's still working.  It is pretty quiet and the timer works well.  My cats don't try to break into it like others seem to do.  It won't work with wet food for 6 days though because the ice will not keep (since it's just water in plastic) but works well for a weekend away.  It has eliminated me having to get up at 4:30am to feed the cats too!"
8,"I purchased the product even with all the negative reviews.  First of all to refill the feeder requires really taking the feeder apart...very cumbersome.  However having said this the green light was on.  I turned it on at the time I wanted it to rotate. 7 am every 24 hours.  I had to wait until the next day. well it never rotated.  Also the lid is very easy to move.  I have a Bengal cat. even if the feeder had worked I know he would have easily been able to move it.  I needed the feeder as we are going away.  However I returned it.  I will look for other options.  Unfortunately there really are no other automatic feeders with any consistent good reviews.  Save your time and effort. this product is not worth the trouble"
8,"My cats got infested with fleas and I had a hard time getting them under control. as a result I had many outbreaks of tapeworm in my three cats.  The vet bills got expensive after awhile. and since I had learned to identify tapeworm infection. with some research. I deemed these safe.  I am an infectious disease researcher myself. so I do have some experience.  These do work. BUT please ALWAYS check with the veterinarian FIRST before you try to self treat your pets.  The wrong treatment for the wrong diagnosis can lead to damaging consequences."
8,"My cat has gotten tape worm a few times now from being infested with fleas (when a cat gets a flea in its mouth that is infected with tapeworm they get it) and nothing worked! I tried a few different tablets and the only thing I found worked to get rid of them was taking my cat to the vet for a shot which was pricey. Just from taking 1.5 of these pills. my cat's worms were gone and for a fraction of the price of taking them to the vet! Would definitely buy these again if needed!"
8,"It works very effectively. I had one of my cats with the tale. tale signs of tapeworms. the rice pods (eggs) in its fecal matter. The gas it passed was enough to make me gag. It was quite unpleasantly odiferous. After 1 day of administration of the medicine. she passed a tapeworm about 9 inches long. So I treated the rest of my cats. They are all fart free. Indications are. if one has tapeworms. the rest do too. Now. time to get some good flea meds for them."
8,"Wanted to try on my own to get rid a my cat's tapeworm. I had seen the white pieces of the worm on her rectum. It was 3 pills.  The first one was wasted. mainly my fault.  The second one was given in a really good treat.  I think she ate most of it.  Have not seen any tell-tell signs on her rectum since then so I am assuming it worked.  The delivery was very fast.  I will use them again."
8,"First of all. this is heavy and bulky.  Those two items are why this is a 4 star item instead of 5.  Having said that. I had no problem lifting or using it.This ramp is superior in every way to another ramp I have.  (The other ramp I have is the Solvit 62337 - it has a sandpaper type finish that is hard to get up if the incline is too steep... say. in a standard SUV.  My dog also FELL off of it NUMEROUS times. hence why I purchased this one).The PetSTEP ramp has a wonderful rubbery texture that makes it easy to walk up and down for a dog.  It is a bi-fold ramp versus a sliding accordian type. but it needs to be for as sturdy as it is.  It stows nicely in the back seat or propped up against the wall in the garage.  The material on this ramp alone makes it worth the price!"
8,"Our 90 pound husky just had ACL surgery and I bought this so he could get in and out of the SUV.  It is a great ramp. easy to use. very sturdy. a cinch to unfold and very lightweight.  The tread is very good and provides for sure footing.  We have used it outside over a few steps for him and it has been left outside in the rain overnight.  It is plastic. so being outside doesn't hurt it and the water runs right off it.  I am really happy with it."
8,"This is a great product but too heavy and cumbersome for most women to use without risk of back injury.  While this product has been a lifesaver. I'm currently looking for a lighter product that will work as well as this one.  If you have a suggestion. please leave me a comment.I use this ramp with a hatchback and for storage am able to stand it on its side against the door using a bungy cord to keep it upright.  This saves a lot of room and allows me to carry 3 large dogs in my hatchback with rear seats folded. I previously tried putting it behind front seat but it was awkward to get in and out with back seats folded down.On the plus side. the ramp is sturdy. easy to clean. and the dogs have had no problem using it.  I used the training instructions for my dog. but his companions were motivated just by dog bones."
8,"Bought used - opted for this version of a ramp for my pack of aging herding dogs - 50 # Aussie/BCs and a 75# Bouvier des Flandres - who were beginning to tear my aging back. Made in USA from  heavy duty plastic by the same folks who made the floor mats I got for the truck (Weather Tek). Folds easily. The weight is necessary for the sturdiness I need (plan to throw in the truck bed when not being used). No metal to rust. Textured ramp built in (no peeling). Altogether the ramp is an ideal product I was very pleased to buy at 60% retail cost."
8,"Bought this for our 50-pound dog. for use following surgery. to reduce the risk of post-op hernia.  Trained him on it prior to surgery. since he's used to jumping in and out of the van.  Dog navigated it just fine. even in post-anesthesia haze :-).  Also used indoors to get him on and off the grooming table.  All surfaces are coated. so there's nothing to scratch the vehicle's paint.  When folded. ramp kept closed with a coil spring. protected with a bit of clear tubing.  Simple solution that works just fine.  Notch in rails well-placed to carrying when folded.  Rubber pads help resist slipping off the bumper when the dog is walking the ramp.  Definitely recommend to dog friends."
8,"Our older dog sometimes has trouble jumping into the SUV. so we bought this for him. It was very easy to train both of our two dogs to use this ramp. We have had the opportunity to use this when we go on our long hikes. we are out for hours and have two very tired dogs when we get back. They walk right up the ramp with no problems.I have had the ramp for about two months and I would recommend this ramp as it is easy to use and to train a dog to use it. We keep it in our back seat to always have it handy. I look forward to using this ramp for years to come."
8,"looked into something that was portable AND would hold up in our winter snows.  Been very pleased with this product.  Following their instructions. I got my dog to use it within a few hours.  It has been out in all sorts of weather and seems to be holding up well.  I like that it will not rust. folds easily and quickly. and has rubber strips to give them traction.  Unlike other similar products. this rubber strip seems to be the superior product.  The box it arrived in was damaged but maybe that was it was so bulky.  It was in pristine condition.  This is helping my dog tremendously with her mobility issues."
8,"Pros:Quickly removes ticks from my dog with their head intactHolds ticks in placeCons:Takes a small amount of practice to properly use.You can do the same thing with tweezers with a little extra effort and attention.Often the ticks get stuck in the crack and you will need a toothpick like object to fish them out.Other Thoughts:Many users say they can't remove ticks until after they have fed. I did not experience this. I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones.The spoon. as I call it. is made of cheap plastic. but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick. It shouldn't break unless stepped on or abused. It is small enough to be easily stepped on if dropped however.I would recommend this and will probably buy another once I get drunk and step on this one."
8,"Love this tick remover!I lived in an area with tons of ticks and my dogs were always getting them. It was disgusting to try and pick them off by hand. and using tweasers was gross because it squeezes the tick and leaves the head half the time. Then the whole match thing never worked for me either.I found this tick remover at the counter of a pet store- took it home to test it out- and voila! Works great. I've had no problems. and it works effortlessly every time for me. Just have to 'scoop' the tick and the tool actually lifts the tick out (the whole tick! no head left behind). Once you get the right scoop technique it will never fail you.Such a stupid idea really. it's basically a teaspoon with a notch cut out. but I couldn't live without it!(& p.s. I have a Siberian Husky with super long hair. and a Great Dane with short hair - so it works great on everyone)."
8,"I used to only buy Science Diet. Knowing my elderly special needs cat did not like his dry food; I decided to buy a bag of this. Big mistake.He did not like it and after a few days I noticed the cat food dispenser was very greasy! I decided to give it to another house cat I have. same results. she did not like it.I am the caretaker of a feral cat colony. I have tried it on 7 feral cats and they are not even crazy about it. They eat it but not eagerly. I poured the bag in a food bin and every time I scoop it out. there is oil in the scooper and also on the plate. It is heavy with oils. It even smells disgusting.Sadly after trying this out on nine different cats. I have to say I would not buy this again. Try a sample locally or buy a smaller bag if you can. Not a hit here at all."
8,"This cat food contains a lower level of magnesium than the 'supermarket' cat foods. Low magnesium levels help to prevent urethra problems. especially in male cats due to their more narrow urethra. I would rather pay the higher price for this brand of cat food than bring my cats to an emergency vet in the middle of the night because their urinary tract gets blocked. not to mention the aggravation caused to the cat. Other brands of low magnesium cat food include Iam's and Nutro-Max. Hill's Science Diet food is round-shaped. rather than 'hooked'. which makes it easier for one of my older tooth-challenged cats to swallow."
8,"We have a kitty with some urinary issues. He developed unprinted crystals. a precursor to kidney stones (vet said it probably felt like peeing shards of glass). He was certainly letting us know. so nobody was happy. (Of course. I was glad he let us knows and even happier when we got it worked out).Here's what we learned. Cat food has to have a balance of specific vitamins/minerals and if the amounts are out of whack. cats are very prone to urinary problems. We had switched to Spot's Stew. an &#34;all natural&#34; food. and it gave our little dude some major problems. Apparently Science Diet is one of the best companies for studying and developing formulas for urinary issues. and behold. we have had NO issues since switching. Can I get an amen?!?!?The price point on the big bag is also excellent. if you do much comparison shopping in the stores. So. everybody is happy!!"
8,"I found two young female cats wondering around my neighborhood and eventually caught them. their fur was rough and dirty from malnourishment and the harsh weather. After a bath and some good science diet cat food. they're as healthy as can be! Their fur is soft and their teeth are so healthy! I also leave a bowl of science diet cat food for the other two feral cats that don't want to be caught. I will not be taking my two new kitty cats off this food. they love it to much!"
8,"each time I give up on the high cost and feed my cats another brand. it takes less than 2 weeks to see the difference in their coats and weight.  They eat way more of the lesser brands and they poop 80% causing litter demand to double.  They eat much less on Science Diet.  I have a personal kitty rescue ranch. no help from anywhere so must watch every penny and cut corners  every way possible.  I find this to be the ultimate food...even if it smells bad.  :)"
8,"I have tried several dog foods for my puppy. this is the only brand and type that he seems to love. my puppy had an issue with eating his poo. so i tried all these other brands and he would continue to eat it. i finally put him on this and sucess! he stopped eating his poo and he eats all his food. i have also given him other science diet wet food with the meat and gravy but he doesnt like it. of note.  this food  will make your dogs poo extra stinky. which is good so he wont eat it but bad for when you pick it up."
8,"I don't use small cans like Fancy Feast. so I cannot comment on those. However. I like these because they LAST. I bought them at a pet food store which no longer carries them. probably because they are so expensive.Except for a lid I bought at least 15 years ago labelled Sargeant's. these are the sturdiest. The more flimsy ones always end up getting a crack in them and are not always tight.For me. the 4 stars. not 5. is because they seem expensive. However. on Amazon. it seems that most of the can covers are more expensive than you would want to pay. It's the S & H that is outrageous."
8,"I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on.  These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and. for me. it worked great.  It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food.  However. as one reviewer pointed out. after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more."
8,"My kitten eats plenty of wet food. and was on 3oz cans for quite some time. This cover sealed those cans. and it was not difficult to remove. A lot of people have reviewed this stating it's too hard to remove from a 3oz can - if it were any easier I'd be worried that it wasn't sealed. The coolest thing about this cover is that now that my kitten is on 5.5oz cans. the same exact cover can seal her food.Only negative is that I was fooled by the photo into thinking I was getting two covers - you only get one."
8,"My miniature schnauzer LOVES this toy. This is my second one buying (not because it broke- because it has gotten so nasty) He drags it with him EVERYWHERE. We have to make him drop this toy. The only downside is if you have hardware floors. this toy WILL scratch them so be careful... My boxer likes this toy as well but not as much because her teeth are alot smaller. I would recommend it for a dog with bigger teeth. I have noticed an improvement in his gum strength. I have had to brush his teeth less since getting this toy and he LOVES it!!! I cannot say enough how much my dog loves this toy. Also. while crate training he used to chew his bed. but once we got this toy he has not touched his bed. If we leave his toy out of his crate. his bed is chewed again........ LIFE SAVER!!!!!!!! Love Nylabone. love this dinosaur!"
8,"My dog got this last year for christmas and its still around and intact. I was worried when after a few days of having it I noticed it had blood on it but he is an obsessive chewer and that soon stopped. Some people have complained about the heads or tails breaking off but mine is still intact. He loves this thing. The only issue I have with it is that now all the little spots on it are sharp and he likes to leave it right in my walking path. I can't help but think he does it on purpose."
8,"My Malinois / Husky loves Nylabones. He has gone through one of the 'souper' bones and is working on another one. I got him this and noticed it was considerably smaller. so he has already chewed off the head and tip of the tail - but it keeps him busy. cleans his teeth and he enjoys it.UPDATE: After a few weeks with this toy I have noticed my dog is able to chew off larger pieces (more specifically the legs) and I have had to take them away for fear of him swallowing them whole. I have also noticed some sharper edges on this bone not only from him chewing. but also the texture of the dinosaur. He has cut himself on it once. but I only realized it when I saw blood on it and inspected his mouth. So. no more of these dinos for me!"
8,"This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever. and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it. but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!"
8,"My dog destroys ANY toy he gets. so I have to be very picky when I do buy him something. Most Nylabone products are safe (we have had some bad experiences with some) but this one is great! I have a puggle who is 30 lbs and he just loves this. I was happy to see a new toy added by Amazon in the nylabone division. and it is a great price. At $5. I can replace these often enough when my dog starts to wear them down. He loves the dinosaur however. he carries it around with him everywhere!"
8,"I was very disappointed in the 'regular' Nylabones - my 20 pound dogs chewed them into sharp. dangerous chunks within a matter of minutes.  I was wary of Nylabone products after that. but the durable ones have turned out to be great. and I'll only buy durable from now on.  My dogs like the bone-shaped durable Nylabones. but they LOVE these dinosaurs.  They never seem to get tired of chomping on them.  They do wear down. but slowly and in tiny pieces that appear to be harmless.  After about a month of three dogs working on two dinosaurs. the toys are missing their heads. but there's plenty more to chew on.  Their irregular shape makes them easy to hold onto and fun to go at from different angles.  My house will never be without these things."
8,"This is a TERRIBLE dog toy. We received the Stegasaurus version of the toy. The &#34;seams&#34; from the plastic mold are incredibly hard and actually sharp. Unfortunately I gave this to the dog without first investigating it and he quickly began bleeding from cut gums. Even if you &#34;shaved&#34; those off. the Stegasaurus's wide. awkward shape is bad for a medium or small dog at least. The hard bumps all over the outside seam weird. If they were softer. I could see how it would be a gum-massage but these are super hard."
8,"I erroneously assumed that I'd get what was shown in all the photos - a T-Rex.  The listing title says &#34;dinosaur varies&#34; and the listing points include &#8226;Available in Brontosaurus. Stegosaurus and T-Rex.  There wasn't an option for me to choose. and I wish it had been clearer to me that the packers would chose what toy I was sent; I would have purchased this from a different shop.Instead of a T-Rex. I got a brontosaurus with a long thin neck that looks like it would be easy to chew off.  My dog doesn't care what dino he got. But the Rex shape looks a lot more durable."
8,"These are a great price. and my dogs can't get enough of them!  I give them as gifts occasionally to friends with dogs. and they find their dogs love them as well.  I highly recommend.  I have two German Shepherd mixes (one with jaws of steel I think) and they stand up to the test.  Eventually they are worn down to nothing. but that usually takes 2 or 3 months. even with my more active chewer.Warning though. you don't want to step on these in the middle of the night!"
8,"My two terrier mixes (20 lbs. and 32 lbs.) love to chew. and their paws-down favorites over the past five years have been Nylabone Dental Dinosaurs. We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems. with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding (very slight) when someone gets a bit carried away. Well. that. and having to confiscate the toys when we're trying to sleep. since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime!After months of use. I take the worn down toys away and replace them. and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.If you have a dog that loves chewing. I've say to give them a try. at first with supervision. If your dogs are like mine. these toys will offer many hours of entertainment and cleaner teeth to boot."
8,"She loves this dinosaur...seriously loves it.  She has many shapes of the Nylabone products--this guy however is by far her favorite.  The head. feet. tail--all chewed off. only the center body is left.I like these because they are designed to massage gums. clean plaque from teeth and as a doggie bonus. they are flavored.  I do recommend the dinosaur in particular on her behalf--she can't type but from the rate of chew. this is a good one."
8,"I got this for my beagle pup as she cannot stop chewing.  I've purchased nearly every chew toy Amazon sells and finally got this.  It was too hard for my 11 week old puppy.  She check it out. mouthed it and never touched it again.  Maybe when she gets larger....Meanwhile. my 8 year-old son loves dinosaurs and wanted it.  So. now it's his.  He knows he might be able to give it up one day. but I don't think I will be able to get it back."
8,"The pup liked this toy very much. but I do not recommend if you have any type of carpet in your house.  We don't even have carpet - just a few wool rugs. but the toy was soon the most disgusting thing in our house.  All the rug fibers and dirt and slobber matted around the nubs on this toy. making it very unpleasant to touch.  We tossed it outdoors. and it wasn't much better.  Those nubs grab everything gross and use slobber as glue to make sure that it stays that way."
8,"After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues. I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter. etc.) to get my dogs to take interest. but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd. Rottweiler. Pit Bull. and Border Collie. so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash."
8,"My dogs have a variety of Nylabones and one from Hartz as well and they all get chewed on depending on what my boys are in the mood for.  They regularly compete to be the one to get dinosaur. so I would rank that as this one being a favorite.  Both my dogs are heavy chewers. but the nylabones seem to last a good long while and they never get tired of them.  One other thing. the dinosaur (with all the little nubs) is probably the most horrible thing to step on when making a trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night!"
8,"I normally buy the Large. super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix.  However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try.  Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.  However. it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy. and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing  on.  If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw. then this bone is for you."
8,"My bullies love Nylabones. they are the one thing that they do not destroy! I got them these & the big smooth bone 2 pack for Christmas. Those were a big hit. these they don't seem to like. I do not know if it's the flavor or texture . . . They have the big smooth heavy bone looking Nylabones which they like okay. they have the BIG nubby ones which they love. so I thought they would like these but they looked at them. chewed on them a little & left them for the big smooth flavored ones in the 2 pack. Those they chew on daily along with the big nubby ones. Maybe it's the flavor. They have Nylabones that are 3 years old!"
8,"I loved the idea of the dinosaur chew toy for my dog and couldn't resist buying him one. I do wish they would give you a choice in the dinosaur type. but random selection isn't terrible. The 3 types shown online are all pretty cute. We received the brontosaurus. My dog weighs 30 pounds and a big chewer. He loves his other Nylabone bone chews. but has not really gotten into his dino chew. I think something about the bumps on the exterior put him off it. He likes to move it around the room and carry it places but has not chewed on it much at all. Sometimes I find him just licking it. We've had it almost two weeks. Maybe once the new has worn off he will chew on it more. He does seem to like it and will carry it places which is pretty funny. Overall I am happy with the purchase."
8,"My dog loved the dinasaur chew toy THAT IS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT.  Unfortunately that is not the chew toy that was received.  The substitution was white and I believe was a taradactal.  It is all angular and sharp points. My dog wouldn't even touch it.  She even know the difference.This looks like a cheap substitution and I am upset that you just assume that we wouldn't know the difference.  I left all of them at the dog park in case some other dog would want them.  From now on DO NOT SUBSTITUTE without advising in advance.  Very upset with this kind of business practice.  All nylabone products ARE NOT equal."
8,"These chews are great. My dachshund-mix 3-month-old puppies were not too interested in the classic nylabone so I got these. and they just LOOOVE them. It's their #1 chew-toy. They can sit in their beds and chew on it forever. I also recommend the Nylabone fish. For some reason the funky shapes and textures are just much more enticing than the regular bone shape. One more note: to get them really hooked on Nylabones I've found that I have to hold the toy for them to chew on at first (so they build really positive associations with it: bone='mom'). at the beginning of a chewing session. and then they're hooked. Don't necessarily expect your dog to just chew it without any of your involvement. The more you're involved. the more he'll enjoy it!"
8,"I placed an order couple days ago and it arrived yesterday. Very impressed that it got here super quick especially on a Saturday. I was really hoping to get the T-Rex chew toy but got the Stegosaurus instead. The choice is random. you can't pick what dinosaur you want which is kind of a bummer. I was reading through many of the reviews and they were mixed between positive/negative. so I decided to purchase it to see what it was like for myself.I thought it was actual bone material but quickly discovered it to be plastic with &#34;little bumps&#34; on it. My dog is a very aggressive chewer and she hasn't chewed through it. She seems to enjoy it very much and so far. there's no cracked or broken teeth! *knock on wood* I'm not too pleased that the chew toy is plastic though. Probably won't purchase again as it could be hazardous to my dog's teeth."
8,"At least 1 out of 2 dogs enjoys it periodically.  It definitely doesn't get chewed down.  The material is very. very hard and I had my doubts about it and the dogs teeth..  However both walmart and petsmart carry tons of nylabone stuff so I figured iT HAd to be alright or there would have been recalls.  Me I don't like it. but the dog does and since she doesn't chew on it obsessively. unlike other things I'm not too worried about her teeth."
8,"I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos. I bought this product selfishly. because I like dinosaurs. Unfortunately. the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody's business and left sharp shards sticking out. She only had it for a short time under (sort of laxed) supervison. but when i looked down the thing's entire tail was covered in blood. Into the trash it went. Moving forward. I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones."
8,"I have a medium sized dog (king charles / bichon mix) and he is a big time chewer.  He's been working on this for over 6 months now and he's done some damage to the tail but still has not lost interest in it.  The only &#34;con&#34; I can think of for this toy is that it does have a large collection of sharp points which I suppose is great for teeth cleaning but a pain in *ss when you step on it running to the bathroom in the dark at 3am. :)"
8,"My dog loves this toy.  It's the one chew toy he actually goes to again and again.  I would give it 5 stars. but I looked down one day and the toy was headless.  Where the head went I have a pretty good guess.  So. I would recommend the toy with the caveat that if your dog is a determined chewer that you probably shouldn't leave him unsupervised with the toy for extended periods of time (such as the amount of time it would take him to behead it)."
8,"I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also. I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)"
8,"My dog is around 6 pounds. and he does not really pay much attention to this toy. I really only bought it for him because his name is Rex and I thought it would be funny. (They did not send a T-rex. just a warning -- they send you a random one!) I knew they were gonna send a random one but I had hoped for a T-Rex. That is not why I give it an okay rating though. My dog just does not seem to care for it. but maybe a larger dog would!"
8,"Careful people! Even though this chew toy says for powerful chewers. it also says for dogs up to 50 lbs in VERY tiny print on the bottom of the package. I gave it to my 79 lb Lab Mix puppy anyway. since I had already bought it... and lo and behold. it began falling apart in only a few moments.After removing the toy and picking up the white bits all over... I thought to come here and warn people. I find it odd how it's for powerful chewers yet only includes medium sized dogs in the toy description! With pit bull terriers and a few other smaller breeds as an exception... usually smaller dog means less destructive chewing ability. Senseless. really.If you have a dog that falls under this weight category... except for a breed with very powerful jaws. this toy probably suits just fine. but if you have a large dog. don't even think about it. I paid almost $9 for a toy that begun to disintegrate within a few seconds."
8,"I was disappointed in this one - Nylabone Durable toys are the only toys I buy for my powerful chewers because they are the most durable I've found to withstand their chewing. This one did not live up to the Nylabone Durable name. I gave it to one of my dogs. who is not the most aggressive chewer in the pack and I had to take it away from him the first day because he was able to destroy part of it and chew off pieces.  I will go back to the Nylabone Durable Souper bones from now on!"
8,"It all depends on whether your dog likes it or not. My friend's dog chews up toys within a day or two of getting them. He has this one still after several months. The head is gone. but the rest is intact. My boyfriend's dog. however. only picks it up when she knows I'm waiting for her to play with it. My only complaint is that when your dog is carrying it around. if he scrapes up against you with the little nubs can be pretty sharp."
8,"We have two lab mixes. The youngest is still very much in puppy stage and boy does he love to chew! We had given him rawhides to keep his focus on something appropriate to chew. but he was going through too many rawhides. I saw nylabones in petsmart in the heavy chewers section. The first plain bone went over well. So I ordered more on Amazon. I'm so glad I did! These were the best solution to keep our chewer occupied! He loves all the different shapes and flavor toys that they have! Thank goodness for nylabones!"
8,"I bought this quite a while back. At first my dog didn't take to it. but it's now one of her old go-to toys. Why 2 stars? This thing gives  my dog an unfair advantage in the house. If we're playing 'chase'. this is the only toy I can never get away from her because it hurts my hands to hold on to. She also leaves it in strategic locations as to cause the bare foot the most damage. Overall. it's a good toy for a dog and not a person."
8,"This is possibly one of the best toys we got for our dog. He's a 55 pound pit bull mutt and he is constantly chewing on the toys we get him. Even the toys that claim they are indestructible inevitably get destroyed by him. Not this one. We have had it the longest out of any toy we have given him. and the best part about it is that it also helps clean his teeth because of the little bumps all over it. If you have a dog who is constantly destroying any toys you give him or her. get this and you won't be disappointed. While it's worth noting that no toy is ever completely indestructible. this one has withstood the test of time and is still going on. even though he has chewed a bit off of it."
8,"A friend of mine has a Border Collie who is a ruthless and devout chewer. who absolutely adores this toy. But. my Aussie is more of a fetcher than a chewer so although he'll have his moments with it. it's not his go to chew toy. Which is the only reason it lacks full stars for myself. But. despite my dogs personal preferences. as a product this is a great chew toy. If your dog has a tendency to chew through anything and everything for hours on end. I would absolutely recommend this to you."
8,"Our Aussie. Iggy. is an extreme chewer. and this $5 bone is worth it.  It's smaller than I had expected but. even after a month Iggy has only destroyed the head.  She will happily chew on this (when we redirect her).  The first couple times she used it her spit was pink so I think her gums might have bled a little. but that stopped.  We will be purchasing more Nylabones as they are so affordable. long lasting. CLEAN. (unlike rope toys that can be distributed throughout your house fiber by color fiber) and enjoyable chew toys found.Caution: stepping on this toy in the dark can bring a full grown person to their knees.  Use care when left out (or always wear slippers)"
8,"My dalmatian just loves her dino. it was her fav nylabone that she got for christmas. the only thing i don't like is that the ends are easy for her to chew up and become sharp but other than that it is holding up well. she is a power chewer and we haven't had any problems with it breaking apart (note-she is only allowed to use most of her toys under supervision. just incase). she also has a large slection of treats and a couple of kongs so she doesn't chew on just one toy all day."
8,"My 6 month old. 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products. She was really interested in this one. HOWEVER. the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp. flaking mess! This chew piece (&#34;for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs&#34;) is NOT good. It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big. pink. patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted. sharp plastic of this T-REX. We were so excited to get a new chew. but it's awful! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing. I suggest Nylabone take this  product OFF the Market. We're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers. hooves & other natural chews from now on! THUMBS DOWN. NYLABONE. =("
8,"I have three dogs.  Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier.  None of them like this toy.  They have had several Nylabone toys. but this one is the least favorite.  Each of them tried it out. but they all got bored with it fast.  It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp.  That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys.  After handling it myself. I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth."
8,"Even for dogs that are 'hard chewers'. this toy is wonderful!  Yes. they can.. and will. eventually wear down parts of the toy {esp the head and tail} from gnawing on it. but it doesn't break off into small pieces as some toys can.  I've used this for big and small dogs. and they all love it equally!  I think the 'bumps' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth/gums. and it must feel good when they chew on it.  Great toy!"
8,"Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this. darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package. It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising. I don't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs. I didn't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers. The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing"
8,"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning. though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks. and it came apart into twisted. jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws. he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust. though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view. but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping."
8,"I thought this would be a little bigger. but that's okay since my American Pitbull Terrier is only 5 months right now. and my Ridgeback mix is medium sized. This is a great size for small-medium Dogs. It's an interesting shape and my Moms cairn terrier mix female claimed it right away! Haha. It's textured for teeth cleaning and strong for super chewers! As with any hard chew toy. do keep an eye on your pet while they chew so they don't hurt a tooth. Ive heard that this can be a problem."
8,"For some odd reason I thought these were chewable. which clearly they're not. I'm not exactly how sure the dental part works in. I haven't noticed better breath or less tarter. It's a hard plastic toy. luckily for me my dog knows better than to eat the pieces she chews off. she just spits them out. If your dog isnt that way I wouldnt recommend as it could do inner damage or atleast monitor your dog. Im giving the product 4 stars because it did arrive earlier than expected. it does keep my dog entertained. shes more interested in chewing this toy than furniture. She seems happy with it so im happy."
8,"My cat Foutchie is heading toward 5 now and no one told her the trouble with a kitten is it eventually becomes a cat (so take that Ogden Nash!).  She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys. especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.  She love jumping high to pop them.So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty. you might try these."
8,"I'm disappointed to say that there are very few bubbles. mostly very tiny and they pop as soon as they touch something.  I gave it a thorough test. blowing air at different speeds and angles. shaking the bottle before using and then using it when it hasn't been shaken in a couple of days. etc.  Total letdown.Important to note: both I and another person who gave this a shot felt stinging in our eyes when the bubbles popped close to our faces.  Not good!!!"
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Please note that though my dogs are capable of ripping this or any fabric toy to shreds. for reasons only known to them. they don't do this. (a Big Retriever Mix & a giant Great Pyrenees mix). This squeaky duck is their favorite for fetch and the toy each consistently chooses to initiate a few rounds of big dog wrestle-rumble. The squeaker holds up to a lot of use and this toy does just fine when run through the washer & dryer. if you find your pup or pups tend to &#34;suck&#34; their stuffed animals and thus render them totally funky."
8,"I've never seen this at the pet stores and our border collie adores them.  He is 7 and has all of his since puppyhood - in varying stages of ick since he plays with them outdoors.  Unfortunately. he likes the old 'duckie' better than a nice new one.  They've held up amazingly well. especially compared to another. pricier. toy from a pet store that started coming apart at the seams immediately.  No duckie ever did that.  He's had some other stuffed toys but these are such a favorite that I've kept a spare. He enjoys the squeaks too although a couple did stop working."
8,"This is my second review for Duckworth and I still feel that this duck is worth every penny. It was the favorite toy of our dog that died at age 13 and it is the favorite toy of our 5 yr old dog that we adopted after the first one died. The dogs couldn't be more different in personality. but they both have loved this toy to pieces. literally. It doesn't get chewed apart but is so well loved that it looks terrible and is starting to fall apart. so we buy two each Christmas and save the second one for mid summer when it is time for a new Duckworth to appear."
8,"Purchased this for our 8 year old stuffed animal collector Hailey the Farm Dog. Hailey is not a toy destroyer (quite the opposite) and while she has given Duckworth many a massive shake. she mainly appreciates the texture of the fur (good for licking and nurturing) and the ability to provide the perfect chin rest for naps! Duckworth seems to be of excellent quality although we have not washed him so I cannot give an opinion of how well he would hold up under those conditions. My suspicion is that Duckworth is NOT for a power chewer and we have taught our terrier to leave it alone :-)"
8,"I bought this toy for my puppy but didn't give it to him until months later because although he likes big toys (it's big for him. he's a 20 pound dog). he also loves squeakers or toys that make fun sounds but this one only has 1 squeaker. When I gave it to him. I thought it would just be a 1 day toy and he would be done with it but 2 months later. this is still his absolute favorite toy. He loves the 1 squeaker and carries his ducky around all the time. This is also one of the few toys he knows by name and will pause and look around every time he gets asked where his ducky is. And he also loves cuddling with his ducky and uses it as a pillow when he sleeps."
8,"I have 7 dogs...all different sizes and breeds.  I make agravy paste and add it over their dry food.  Every single one of them gulps this stuff down -- I've never had ALL of them love anything as much as this before!  It looks nasty when mixed (think dirty diaper). smells like beef gravy. but it certainly does the trick. Two of my dogs have arthritis and they seem to be improving (I also give them fish oil and glucosamine).  My beagle has gone from being barely able to stand up to running around and playing.  I'm waiting to see if it helps with the tear stains on my Bulldog's face.  Too soon to tell.  But they all love it and for that reason alone. so do I."
8,"My dogs absolutely love the taste of this stuff.  It makes a wonderful smelling gravy.  I love the fact that I don't have to give them anything else besides this in addition to their dry food.  I don't know if my dogs would eat their plain food again without this mixed in.  I haven't noticed that much difference in their overall health. but they were already in great condition before giving this to them.  I just hated having to mix lots of different supplements and yogurt and so on every time I fed them.  This makes it wonderfully easy to keep them healthy.  And Amazon has the best prices to buy this."
8,"I had my dog on this for a couple months and noticed a wonderful bloom in his coat but also noticed his ears began to be unusually smelly. I feed my dog raw so he doesn't get grains anywhere. I checked the product closely and noticed the ingredients label listed flax seed. Took him off Nupro and his ears cleared up. We now stay away from anything with flax. After adding raw green tripe to his diet. I am noticing similar positives. It is a shame. Nupro is otherwise a great product. I would recommend it to others whose dogs are more tolerant of flax."
8,"I have 2 labs. one of whom had bowel surgery at 5 months and lost part of his intestines. This affects his ability to absorb the nutrients in his food. I started adding this and the Nupro Joint supplement to both of my dogs food. The LOVE this stuff. It makes a nice gravy that my dogs just adore. I can't get them to stop licking the bowl when their food is gone.I have no idea if it's helping or not but the pup is healthy and growing and gaining weight. I can't ask for more than that. The fact that this does not have a noxious odor is a HUGE plus for me. It seems to be made with healthy ingredients and is chock full of nutrients. At the very least. it can't hurt so I give it to both dogs."
8,"I first won a 5-pound can of Nupro at a collie specialty show. The person who donated the gift commented. 'This stuff will grow hair on eggs!' Funny. But I've used it for several years ever since that first can. and my collie's coat is gorgeous. This is a great product. My dog is 9-1/2 yrs old. looks about 4. and acts like a puppy. (You can see him at [...].) I won't stop adding this to his food."
8,"No matter how good the nutritional value is. or how good it smells. it's no good if the dog won't eat it. and mine won't.  I am SO disappointed.  I tried mixing it in warm water to make a gravy.  Smelled great.  He hated it.  I then tried heating the &#34;gravy&#34; to really mix the powder into the HOT water.  I let it cool.  Put it on his food.  Hated it.  Next I tried it dry. just sprinkled on top.  He hated that. too.  The good news is that my brother's Rottweiler loves it.  But he loves anything!  I wanted this supplement because I am concerned about my fussy eater.  Unfortunately. it didn't help ME. at all."
8,"I have been using the Missing link skin & coat for my bulldog. She was diagnosed with a nutrition deficiency even after eating $50 a bag dog food for years. The missing link helped but it was expensive. So when I saw this 5lb tub I jumped on it. Here is the issue. the dose of the Nutri-pet is 2 scoops a day. The missing link is 1/4 of a scoop a day. This 5lb tub did not last very long.I don't know if it really helped my dog. Her skin conditions still seems to come back every few months. This was only a 1 month supply for my 50lb dog. So once the tub was empty I went back to Missing Link. the 5lb bag is a little more expensive but lasts 6 months or more."
8,"I have two dogs. a Boston terrier and a maltese mix and I have been making home made dog food for them for almost three years now. Their meals include protein (meat or chicken). oats. a variety of vegetables and sweet potatoes. My vet recommended that I include a supplement such as this and fish oil in their meals. Since I have been feeding my dogs home cooked meals. my Boston who is now seven has a lot less grey hair on his face. both dogs (my maltese is six) still act like they are young dogs. and they are both in very good health. While I can't attribute this to the powder completely. I do think it works and I don't see any reason to change their diet now. Also. both dogs seem to like the taste. so that's a plus."
8,"I bought this product to supplement my Siberian husky&#8217;s home cooked diet that is supplemented with high quality kibble.  We have been adding Nupro to her 3 daily meals for nearly 2 months now and her coat is noticeably smoother & shinier.  Previously she had hotspots around her mouth from licking; Nupro has almost totally alleviated this.  Shockingly. she turned the powder down at first (we have read reviews that said dogs couldn&#8217;t refuse the smell/flavors) but now we mix the powder with water and top it onto her food and she can&#8217;t get enough.  This is a great product for anyone looking for a top quality dog food supplement."
8,"I first heard about this product when my beagle was dying from mast cell cancer. A blog I came across recommended I give this to her. While she didn't make it. I couldn't help but notice the shiny coat this product gave her. I now feed this to my golden retriever. and I have from 8 weeks of age. He LOVES the stuff. and he definitely sheds less when on Nupro. One thing I've noticed. however. is when starting him on a batch of this stuff (after a few months of hiatus). his breath will REEK. I'm not sure what to do about it ... as the Orapup doesn't seem to take the smell away. After a few weeks. however. his breath is back to normal. Very good product! Highly recommended."
8,"I have been using Nupro Dog Supplement for about a year now.  Originally. I was making my own dog food and needed a supplement.  Now I have found a dry dog food that my fussy-stomached German Shepherd can eat.  I still add Nupro to his and my other dogs food daily.  I can say for sure that it helps for a shiney coat. but mostly I feel confident that my dogs are getting all the nutritional benefits that they need. I have found no adverse effects and my dogs absolutely LOVE love it! Sometimes I just make a gravy out of the Nupro as a special treat for my dogs."
8,"Our dogs love it.  We rescued two woofs and one of them was severely abused.  Mange. fungal infection. abuse. no fur...horrible skin.  Dr. told us that he probably wouldn't get his fur back.  The rescue folks suggested Nupro Gold as they've seen wonders with this product.  It's hard to say if his fur would have grown back on it's own (and some of it on his face did not return) without the supplement. but we did use it and his coat is now beautiful.  We are continuing to use it."
8,"I have 2 Basenjis.  Our 1st one started losing his hair in circles with little scabs underneath.  We took him to the vet 5 times. scrapings were done. negative. blood & stool. negative.  He was looking very puny. my gorgeous red/white Basenji.  On top of this we were waiting for the day we would become parents to a Basenji pup.  However. we had an amazing breeder. and he told us about Nupro gold. and we promised to continue with it in his diet.  Naturally we  followed directions for Charley.  Miraculously within a month his coat was back more beautiful than before.  I recommend this to all dog owners.  My dogs love the taste.  It is keeping my boys in great shape."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
8,"I haven't used the product long enough to evaluate whether or not it will help my dog's hip dysplasia. however I can tell you that it has caused HORRIFIC gas. Bad enough that I had to put my dog out of my room in the night (wher he usually sleeps) because it was almost gagging me and was hard to breathe. He has not had a diet change. the only thing changed is I added this supplement to his regular food. so it's obviously the supplement causing the gas. Not sure how long I can handle the gas. but I will give it some more time to see if it helps his hips. as he really needs that."
8,"I have been giving this to my 2 dogs for about a month and their hair is so much softer than before. My pug hair was kind of rough on the back and now it has become super soft. My boxer hair has become shinier as well but i have to put him on less amount because it was too much for his digest system. He was having diarrhea until i cut back on this to half and now he is all good and healthy. Both dogs appear to have more energy and i would definitely recommend this to anyone."
8,"As per my review for the Nupro nutritional supplement. this stuff is great. I have no idea if it will help the dogs' joints or not but since I take glucosamine and chondroitin for my joints. I figure it is a good idea. My labs are pretty hard on their joints. They love to run and jump. I am hopeful that early supplementation will prolong their joints. This stuff makes my labs very happy! They love the taste and I do not find the smell to be objectionable. It smells like real food to me. I buy it monthly now and intend to continue."
8,"We have been using this for less then a week and our 14 year old Pit Bull X is running around like a 9 year old!!! She had been starting to make ALLOT of cracking noises while stretching. especially in her neck and we noticed her slowing down.  Within 2 days the cracking sound is gone and she is able to go for family walks again and keep up with her 4 year old Catahoula brother.  Added bonus is that she LOVES the taste of the gravy that you get when you add water to the powder... I can't recommend this product enough and will be ordering the 20 lb once the 5 lb container is finished."
8,"Our Koi do well on this food. so I ordered several 5 pound bags to get us through the summer. However. the actual bags have changed from last year. Whereas before they were easy to zip open and closed. and had a handle built in. now they do not have either of those features. In fact. the bag is practically impossible to seal between feedings. And it is very bulky and awkward to carry out to the pond now that there is no handle built in to the bag. I don't understand why the company would change these two features. it doesn't make any sense. I am going to have to find a suitable container now. to pour 5 pounds of fish food in to. that will have a handle and that I can close properly in between Koi feedings. Very disappointed."
8,"Very solid food. Will probably last an entire summer in the size. and the bucket is rainproof. My fish seem to like it a lot and it doesn't cloud the water. I can't say it's 'improved the color of the fish' as they claim. but I kind of find those claims dubious no matter who makes it so they can have a pass on that. Besides. I didn't exactly have a batch of control fish to measure against. so maybe it has.I'd recommend this food."
8,"Once you get over the errr... provocative shape you'll find a heavy duty bone.  This is the ONLY bone I will leave in her crate. She is a super chewer and has whittled down the tip of this to a point but it has not broken off as any large pieces. This bone is the safest bone we own. We have had it for 6 weeks now and it's still going strong.  I actually just bought a second one to keep in the kitchen.  She has other nylabones (I only buy her the hard plastic ones and I always buy the biggest size available) but this is the only one I leave in her crate."
8,"I have two medium-sized dogs who each have one of these.  The Souper size lasts them for many months as they are power chewers.  The smaller sizes only last a few weeks.  This is hard but not as hard as a real beef bone and is kinder to teeth and gums.  They also enjoy just carrying these around in their mouths. but I have to be careful I don't get one dropped on my bare foot!  These don't break off in litle pieces or slivers and are easy to clean if my dogs play with them in the dirt.  I will definitely buy these again."
8,"I so want to buy nice squeaky toys for my two Bernese Mountain Dogs. But alas it is not to be. The male has been known to tear apart expensive. indestructible. for powerful chewers.you all the fun toys in minutes. Which leaves me nylabones or kongs. Both of them seem to prefer the Galileo to the other nylabone products. They chew after every meal and these tend to last about a year. There will be little white stuff on your carpets and also in their poop. The bones get sharp and are trip hazards but save the furniture and seem to be good for their teeth. My Berners give these two paws up !!"
8,"When our dog plays with this thing she throws it in the air and when it lands it sounds like she just threw a brick.  Minus the loud nature of this toy it is great. our dog is a powerful chewer and she can put bite marks into it but that's about all.  We have had this toy for about 5 months and it is still intact but with hundreds of bite marks in it.  I would strongly recommend NOT stepping on this.  Overall this is a durable toy that our dog loves."
8,"Keep your toes out of the way - it's heavy and it's very hard.  We had a GSD years ago who loved his. now our current puppy has turned out to be a power chewer and I decided to try it.  She is medium sized at 35 lbs. so I dared to get the big one and she loves it! I know it will last a long time. but I did move it to the yard due to the noise factor of her dropping it on the had floor - fine with her. we keep quieter toys inside and this is a definite favorite of hers.***** I had to cave in and order her a smaller one. the souper size is a lot of fun for our dog. but the way she tosses it around it's downright dangerous sometimes. Stand back and let her at it.  So the smaller one turned out to be good. she loves it and I get to keep my toes."
8,"Nylabone is just the best.  Our yellow lab has been working on this Galileo for well over two months.  Anything smaller for her chewing habits is gone in less than a week.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a dog who gets bored just laying around and 'wants to be doing something.'  Best thing about these Nylabones are you can boil them in water to take away any smell that might come about with a little 'age' if your dog likes to take their time with something this size.  The worse thing about this is that after constant chewing. you get the little 'plastic spikes' that are created on the bone... and let me tell you what... this thing is NO FUN to step on in the dark when it has been chewed on-a-plenty!  Highly recommend!!!"
8,"I have tried numerous bones and chew toys without success. My 90 lb Lab/Pit mix is a heavy chewer who has destroyed just about everything I gave him. Even the heavy rubber Black Kong Extreme he was able to conquer. I ordered the Galileo Bone based on many positive reviews. Initially I thought the price was high. $14.00 bucks for a dog bone? This thing is huge and will outlast 10 cheaper ones. My dog loved it! It has a chicken flavor that made it irresistible. He chewed it for over an hour straight barely making a mark in it. This bone will last a long time and is worth the price."
8,"Although I think the Nylabones are good if not the best bones to get for overactive chewers. I have not purchased this particular and peculiar. uh. 'bone' as I can't fathom a dog chewing on a 'toy' that resembles a penis. Besides. what will visitors think when there's a chewed up looking plastic. penis-resembling 'toy' laying on the floor?So. I ask the company. why??I think I will stick to the 'bone' shaped chews. my favorite being the giant dura-chews. which stand up to their name and last a really long time!  And my dog(Terrier-Sheepdog mix) is a power-chewer and may have a compulsive chewing disorder being a year and a half old! :)"
8,"I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer (lab/shepherd mix) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy. Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes. and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15. This was not a good fit for our dog. and I'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog. You just never know. We still buy the Big Chews religiously."
8,"I have a bloodhound/coonhound/black lab mix. He is a very aggressive chewer (he gnaws on stuff until it's gone) and I've always had problems finding toys he doesn't destroy.I ordered the Souper size. which was a good size for him. It held up longer than other bones I have ordered. but I had to throw it away after about an hour. The bone is very solid. but what he ended up doing was dragging his teeth on it. which created large chunks of sharp. hard plastic. He got a few pieces off of it before he cut his gums on it and yelped. After an unfruitful search for the missing pieces and some time cleaning the blood off the carpet. into the trash it went!Overall I'd say it's a nice product. just not the right one for very aggressive chewers."
8,"I don't know what it is about the Galileo. but my American Bulldogs looooove it. They will actually fight over it. I don't know whether its the shape or flavor or what. I usually get them Nylabones dura chews (as they are strong chewers) and this holds up about as well (though it is hard to gauge as they really chew this one so much more). The biggest size is much larger than the second largest size. so despite the big price jump I still think its worth it."
8,"I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also. Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."
8,"I have three large mixed breed dogs who are extremely powerful chewers and after much trial and error. I would never buy any other brand except Nylabone.  Nothing else lasts as long and occupies them as Nylabone does.  They always fight over this one in particular - perhaps they like it because it is much larger than all their other Nylabones.  This is definitely the largest one I have seen. so I would only recommend this for someone with a large dog.  I would recommend anything Nylabone if you want your dogs to chew a toy instead of your furniture!"
8,"I guess I'm in the minority.  I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this.  Good chewing BUT.....they made my dog sick and he barfed five times.  And guess what came up?  And. yes. the sharp little edges were still there.  No more nylabone products for me. I feel so strongly about the danger of these products that I am making the effort to go to every nylabone product on Amazon to post this warning.  mb"
8,"First Impression: Man it was time for a new Nylabone. Mom and Dad bought me my first two almost 5 months ago! They were looking a little nasty. but I still loved them. The kind folks over at Nylabone sent me a gift box and I got to try out this new monster of a chew bone. Now it is shaped a little weird. but I like it none the less. Every time Mom and Dad eat lunch or dinner I lay down and chew on a Nylabone. It keeps me entertained while they eat that amazing smelling human food... I just close my eyes and pretend.Conclusion: Great chew bone! Lasts a very long time. Not sure what could be improved."
8,"My dog likes this okay but it's not his first choice. The Nylabone DuraChew Hollow Stick Bacon is his first choice followed by the Nylabone Big Chews for Big Dogs Turkey Leg. Because he prefers the others this hasn't shown much wear yet. It was also really stuck to the packaging when I got it which was a bit strange and made me wonder if it was old. Plus it's a bit odd looking laying on the floor--almost like something that could be in an IKEA &#34;Tidy Up&#34; commercial. Lol."
8,"Our Bulldogs LOVE this toy and so do we. First the shape is a great design it's full of all sorts of curves and areas where your pooch can get a good hold and settle down to a long chew-fest. Easy to carry around even the goliath sized Souper presents no mobility problem for our 10 month old puppy.Our oldest a 95 pound 6 year old Old English Bull dog was practically weaned on this toy and he adores them. I can't even begin ti count how many we've been through which should give you a good idea of how much our dogs love these. The material isn't the newer extra tough Nylabone - but it's tough enough to hold up to Harley's massive jaw strength and relentless. no merct chewing fests.Like all Nylabones we discard them when the ends fray. This is one of their best toys and an all time favorite."
8,"Bought this for my 2-year-old lab as she is a chewer.  She sniffed it and walked away.  I left it in her toy box and she picked it up once but only to move it out of the way to get at something else.  I don't think it has a smell that entices dogs to chew it as my 9-month-old. also a big chewer. hasn't touched it either.  I'm sure there are other dogs who love this but it was a waste of money for me."
8,"Our lab carries around sticks. rocks. you name it wherever she goes. This particular style of Nylabone is exceptional because of the design.  There are two ridges that fit their incisors perfectly so they can carry it around without worrying it will slip out and break my foot if she drops it!~ Also. even though not flavored. she likes to work on it slowly. which means for the money it will last a long time.  We've spent a lot on the other types of designs and she liked them but they were either to destructible or too heavy for her to walk around with for any amount of time.  For whatever reason. it seems to calm her to carry a bone around and this is the best designed. tough and perfect size for a large dog. She says THANK YOU:)"
8,"I have two Rhodesian Ridgeback puppies (5mo & 10mo) and they LOVE the Galileo Bone in the 'Souper' size. They grab it with their two front paws and will knaw on it for a half hour straight. It seems like it will last for a long time and the more they chew it. the more they enjoy it. It doesn't make a mess when they're chewing. the ends fray into something like tooth brush scrubbers. but don't break off.  I don't think the 5mo old would enjoy it as much if the 10mo old hadn't already started chewing it to create these scrubbers. It's probably best for dogs that have their adult teeth grown in. It would be too tough for the little one to knaw into a brand new one. I'm ordering a second one so they don't have to share it anymore! :)"
8,"My little boxer-pit bull mix has chewed through every 'durable' toy there is.  I got her the 'wolf' size Galileo and had to help her start it (it's slippery before they scratch it up) but now she loves it.  If you have a dog that can chew the other durable Nylabone products down to a nub then this is for you!  It doesn't even seem to matter that it's not flavored (at least not to my knowledge).  I would also recommend the Nylabone Double Action Chew - this one has also lasted far longer then the Nylabone durable regular bones."
8,"This chew toy has lasted thru several strong German Shepherds.  The original lasted nearly 5 years.  No noticeable pieces of the toy seem to be laying around the house or in the dogs stools.  It really is a tough toy and although it's probably made in China (products that I detest). I've seen no adverse reactions to the dogs using it.  It is a bit heavy for the small German shepherd female that we have. our 125# boy plays with it like tossing popcorn.  I'll definitely purchase another when this one wears out!"
8,"We have an avid chewer (lab/boxer) and bought this thinking it might be a toy that actually lasts. Well it has but only because our dog won't chew it.  I was very surprised at how hard it was and was worried about our dog's teeth.  He was interested when we first gave it to him but now never touches it.  I think it's partially because of the heavy weight of it also.  We've had better luck so far with the KONG Extreme Goodie Bone. Our dog will chew this (we don't put treats in it. although you can).  I think he likes it because it's a softer material that he can sink his teeth into a bit. So far it has lasted."
8,"Well. my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates."
8,"In 1994 One of my heavy-chewing Samoyed dogs had a deadly episode with a Nylabone toy.  When I made the President of the Nylabone company aware of the problem with his product. he was extremely cooperative.  He not only undertook settling all the medical expenses but a couple of months later sent my dog a Galileo Souper with an attached note that read:  'Our team of engineers have come up with Galileo. the toughest dogbone around. created just for hard chewers like Rajah.  This is the first bone off the production belt for him.  I hope he is well now and will enjoy Galileo.''Silver Frost Rajah' has since passed away of old age. but his offsprings and currently his grand-puppies are enjoying it.  And. except for some teeth-scrapes. the Galileo is STILL intact !"
8,"I recently ordered three different Wellness Canned Cat Food varieties. I ordered the chicken. beef and chicken. and turkey. My cats LOVED all three and couldn't get enough of the food. I found the consistency to be perfect as well with the perfect amount of moisture or broth that my cats love. I did not have any problems with damaged cans that some users noted. I am ordering another case of all three flavors and I will keep this review updated if I come across this problem in future orders. Overall. highly recommended!"
8,"Still a work in progress. I've been trying to experiment with different brands and flavors of grain free cat food.  The Vet believes that there may be some obscure ingredient contained in some foods that makes my cat sometimes regurgitate the food quickly after she consumes it.  I've found that she can usually tolerate this one better than most.  However. the quest is still in progress. since she occasionally has issues with this one as well.Although she seems to like this flavor all right. I'm docking a star off the rating because it is sort of a pasty pate.  In addition. I've found it to have an obvious amount of whitish grease in it (especially when it is cold). requiring that I heat it briefly in the microwave--otherwise she will regurgitate it for sure."
8,"We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?"
8,"What. you say? A finicky cat? How unusual! Right. But as they are finicky. it also means that what one cat likes or dislikes may be entirely subjective and not true for another cat. Damn animals! Gotta love 'em. Anyway. as I said. it is a high quality food. and not as expensive as the ones my cats will eat. of course. (Especially in the big cans.) It is not grain-free. though. And remember that fish types are cheaper to make. but aren't so healthy for your cat. This is also the pate form. which. of course. my cats don't seem to care for. They like the gravy stuff. thank you very much. So you might want to try this. But I suggest going to a store and just buying a few cans. and some different flavors. for the picky little things to try first. Definitely not a whole case. like you-know-who did."
8,"We purchased this dental Kong version as an alternative to our dog's regular Kong toy.  We stuff either this or one of the other Kong's for him each day and give it to him when we leave for work.  The large size is perfect for our 60 lb. American bulldog/lab mix.  He will get it to play with and chew at other times of the day.  So far. after two months. it hasn't worn out or fallen apart.  He seems to enjoy it just as much as his regular Kongs.  It favorably compares to other Kong products and it's a good value for the price."
8,"We have had a regular. large size red Kong for months. It's still going strong. We put a medium size Milk Bone in it and he loves it.He's now fully grown at 70 lbs and I figured I'd upgrade to a bigger size and get some teeth cleaning done at the same time.NOT an upgrade!Short version. I put a large Milk Bone in it. I'm in the room with him and I look over and see him with his head up proudly looking at me chewing. but the Kong is on the floor. I figure he got the bone out of it already. but there is no crunching. Turns out he's eating a piece of the Kong and there are other pieces missing that he must have already swallowed. I don't know how dangerous that could be but it seems pretty bad. What if I had left him alone with it.The story ends...... Ten minutes from Amazon package to garbage can."
8,"We have a one year old shepherd. boxer. pitt mix and he liked this toy a lot.  But then we left him alone with it one day (as we often do with his Kong toys) and he ripped it to shreds.  I didn't know that was possible with Kong Toys.  We'll stick to black Kong toys from now on. The good news. my husband put the bulbous end of using a saw and now we use it as a somewhat durable ball for play in the backyard.  So we still got some use out of it. just not its intended use."
8,"Costco's Kirkland Dog Biscuits fit perfectly (tight enough to stay in) in this toy. and isn't easy for my pup to get it out.  She's a labrador.  She works it for a while before she starts slamming it to the ground. thus breaking the biscuit up and allowing small pieces to come out at a time.  I can see it working even better with a smaller dog maybe. although it is quite a large Kong toy.  My dog doesn't have separation anxiety when I leave for work anymore. because she knows she's going to get her Kong with a treat inside every time I leave."
8,"Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy. and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged. yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours."
8,"I tried this product after using Arm & Hammer. Tidy Cats. and at least one other brand. My cat is not picky about his food or litter and has never missed his litter box. I slowly integrated this litter with Arm & Hammer Litter and it wasn't until it was nearly completely World's Best Cat Litter that he decided to take a dump less than two inches away from his designated area.This has never happened before but luckily that was the only incident. Looking over it. I still can't find many reasons to continue purchasing this brand. It tracks EVERYWHERE. I have a black table nearby my cat's litter box and it looks like someone dropped corn flour every time my cat exits his designated area. The odor control is mediocre at best.I do not recommend this litter nor will I be repurchasing this brand."
8,"I've given this product a good run of 4-5 months of use. My cats thought it was strange at first. but they used it. My biggest complaint is that it only stays fresh smelling for 3-4 days. A few days after changing out all of the litter it begins to take on a damp. sickly sweet corn smell--not a cat pee smell. but yucky nevertheless. I clean the 2 litter boxes twice a day (two cats in the house). and the pee clumps are fairly hard but tend to crumble more easily each day as the litter loses freshness. In other words. you really need to change out the litter every two weeks. which gets expensive. If you go longer than two weeks. the litter just smells offensive. I'm returning to cat crystals."
8,"WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was1 either completely ignored2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing"
8,"the price and size were right to donate to humane society. My cats have refused to switch to purina or whiskas from Blue buffalo. I was seeking to reduce costs but just knew when I saw the big bag that there was no way my cats would eat it.  I had thought it was fancy feast...white cat...gourmet...so when I realized its just a cheaper brand than even the purina ....well. As a donation though it helps Im sure.. The dogs will eat it if the cats wont..at my place the racoons get whatever the cats reject."
8,"I have a crazy-mad chewer at home. and an occasional chewer too. Upon arrival. I quickly unwrapped the toy and looked at it. It is covered in little bumps that look very easy to chew off. so I was a little skeptical on how this would hold up. but I like it because it cleans their teeth. I gave it to the occasional chewer. and she sniffed it before slowly grabbing it. chewed a little while. and left it alone. She hasn't chewed on it much since. The crazy-mad chewer likes it. but not as much as the other bone. He was chewing it one night and from the sound I thought it would be gone in the morning. but no. it is still holding up pretty well. A few of the bumps have come off. and some are stretched. but overall it is doing well for my dogs...and protecting things I don't want them to chew on."
8,"My dog was so very sick and as I was about to take him to the ER. he vomited several pieces of this chew bone. I will add a photo. This could have been a disaster requiring surgery. or causing death.  PLEASE. don't buy this. My dog loved it but I should have listened to the other negative reviews. Please don't learn the hard way like I did.  He's only 13 lbs.PS I have since learned that rawhide treats are no good either. the rawhide sits in their stomach taking weeks to digest. The butcher dept in my grocery store sells bone marrow bones. I think it's the cow's femur. I boil it for 15 mins and dogs love it  It will keep him busy for hours.Update:  I've since learned from comments below that dogs have broken their teeth on these bone marrow bones. Luckily my dog seems to be over the chewing phase ."
8,"My dog really likes the Nylabone (Blue) Dental Chew. I've never experienced a problem with her use of it in all the years I've been getting it for her. The nubs on the surface of this chew toy massage the gums and the salivation promoted by it helps clean the teeth.As with all dog chew toys. you should periodically check to see how your dog is doing with it. Any chew toy fragment swallowed (no matter what type of chew it may be) can suddenly become stuck in the throat or intestinal tract.(I did not give it 5 stars because it's not made from a natural material.)However. I am very disappointed in the price tag from Amazon:  as of this review. the regular size (4-1/2') is sold for $5.49. but you can get it through Drs. Foster & Smith Pet Supplies for $2.99 -- I discovered this AFTER I'd placed my Amazon order. Amazon and its merchants know they can sell it for less and should be competitive with their prices."
8,"I bought one of these at PetsMart. and my puppy loved it. so bought another one on Amazon.  They're good. but don't last too long; maybe a week. more or less.  Puppy has lots of toys. but when he FOCUSES on this one. it gets worn down rather quickly.  It's not too expensive. though. but I've also taken to freezing a wet washcloth for him to gnaw on.  Great soaked in broth or stuffed with kibble then frozen for 20 minutes."
8,"This is the only 'hard' synthetic chewy my dog is really interested in. It is slightly pliable rubbery material - but he's had others with a similar feel that he wouldn't chew as long as this. Not sure if it's the nubby texture? I bought this size hoping he could hold in his paws. but it's still a little short (he's a 20 pound dog). We end up holding one end while he chews - with his eyes closed and an expression of pure joy. He works pretty hard at it for 10 minutes or so."
8,"I spent several decades slinging around large bags of as many as three age-specific formulations at a time. depending on the makeup of my family. I can't do that anymore and I was happy to find the &#34;all life stages&#34; formulation. guess we've come full circle from when I was young and all dogs of whatever age ate the same thing. Anyway. the bottom line was would they eat it. Resounding yes! Rip. the old boy. bolted his down (one of the reasons I like small nuggets) and then was snacking out of the bag until I closed it. at which point he lay down right by the bag. That was a couple of bags ago and they continue to eat it happily. No digestive difficulties that I'm aware of and I do keep up with stuff like that."
8,"My dogs skin has improved a lot since I switched her to this food. I'm dissappointed in the amount of grains used in it and tomato pomace. Protien amounts are great. For only a few dollars more I can get a grain free salmon dog food made in the usa not by one of these huge dog food companies that tend to have recalls all the time. If your on a strict budget this is a great food for dogs. but I want better for mine so I'm switching to Taste of the Wild dog food."
8,"On June 15 I adopted a 2yr old jack-a-poo which was rescue from a puppy mill. Every time he ate he would make strange sounds. He would also throw up a lot. The foster mom had him eating wellness brand. I had him for 2 months and really had no idea what to do.I switch him over to Purina Pro Plan Sensitive skin and Stomach just to see if that would help. I am surprise at  the result. It is like having a new dog. He no long makes sounds or throw up. If he drinks water to fast he coughs but. other then that this food has fixed his issues.I highly recommend this if your dog has issues eating they may just need a different diet."
8,"This product has better ingredients at a better price than some lesser quality foods. I'm still debating making my own dog food. They suggest not giving dogs table food. but cheaper dog food typically costs $1/pound. I have a difficult time purchasing food for my family that's $1/pound (we eat A LOT of chicken for that reason). Chicken is currently $0.49/pound. Homemade dog food is looking very cost effective these days. Either way. apples to apples. this is a reasonable purchase. It doesn't cause my dog flatulence like some other brands."
8,"Been using this for awhile now. I have three dogs. A husky. a husky mix and a Rottweiler. They love this food for one. Amazon ships it in a big box to keep it safe. It is very healthy compared to most dog foods. It is pretty cheap and it fills them up! I only have to buy one bag a month because it is so filling. They are healthier and stronger looking. Their fur is shinier than ever. They have muscles I never seen before. They are lean and more energetic. Their teeth have become more white and less stinky breath even! I will never stop buying this for them! Good dogs deserve the best food! This is it. Their is nothing I dislike about this food! NOTHING."
8,"I found this to be the best bargain for a higher quality dog food. comparable to Wellness and Blue Buffalo. My dogs both love it and one of my dogs that often gets topical yeast infections does not have problems on this food so its not full of bread filler. The only other food comparable for my dog's yeast problem is Wellness and it got too pricy for me.  I did notice a salmonella recall on the Diamond lamb flavor. spring of 2012. so I keep an alert on my google news.  but its the only recall I've seen and it went public fast. right on the Diamond site and there were no fatalities because it was dealt with well.  Still. good to know."
8,"Hey if my dog loves this thing that means is good! I know. you'd be like all dogs love food. but mine is different. He eats mostly meat. and this is just like something to be over there. I usually give him a coup and a half. and will last him 1 1/2 day. He is very picky when it come to dog food. and this was the first time when he actually eat that just like that. I have an old school pitbull. 67-68 pounds average."
8,"You would not believe all the trouble I went through with my dog and so called dog foods.  I even tried some of the really expensive stuff and I would still have to spend a fortune (again) on wet food for her to even eat it.  So I came across this and after reading many many reviews I took the plunge.  OMG!!!!  for the first time ever my dog eats this food (on a regular basis) by it's self.  I am now almost done with my first bag and will be buying another two.  This dog food even smells good.  and for any dog that is a huge deal.  I will not hesitate to tell my friends about this brand."
8,"My dogs love this food. it is great as it has ingredients that I can understand and know what they are: and no biproducts! It has one of the higher ratings among the dog food lists. I have been letting my two dobies use this for this reason. It lists no biproducts and Beef meal and barley and rice are the first three ingredients. I have to say it is great dog food for the price. as we are on extreme budgeting in this household; and with Amazon. it qualifies for free shipping. which makes it even more appealing! Thanks. Patti Roth"
8,"Purchased Diamond Beef Meal and Rice - dogs loved it at first....  I mixed it in with their old food and all was well for awhile. then I noticed that after about a week they stopped eating it all together.  Even when I left it in to bowl and didn't give them their old food for a short period. they wouldn't eat it.  I noticed vomit on the floor and saw my dogs both start to drink LOTS of water.  Bad sign - giving up on this stuff.  Read about their problems with recalls - bad choice to buy this product!!!"
8,"We were using Diamond Lamb and Rice for Puppies. but all of a sudden our dog had diarrhea that just wasn't clearing up. The vet did every test in the book. and they were all fine. So we changed his food. thinking maybe the lamb just wasn't doing it for him. and chose this Beef Meal and Rice Formula. His stomach issues cleared right up. but now he only eats his food once a day. when he used to inhale it twice. I think he doesn't like the new flavor. He'll inhaled it when his Natural Balance wet food is mixed in. though!"
8,"I didn't get what picture and ingredients showed.  So I went to Pet store to rebuy My dog's treats.  They didn't have duck potato lg size without hickory smoke either.the pet store was told the packaging would change. Picture very deceiving and Hickory Smoke flavor was NOT included in description nor size change.  So Yes I was and am kind of disapointed.  I may buy them again. I don't knowthank you Peggy W.Actually they turned out to be good. My new little chihuahua mix pup loves them and my sweet Jeffery who has passed away loved them.  review from 2 stars to 5 stars."
8,"My dog loves them. I've stopped ordering them from Amazon though because my local pet store sells them for four-ninety nine and has an ongoing deal where if you buy three bags. you get the 4th free.. Check out your local pet store for better prices.These are great quality. safe treats. My dog eats the dry. limited ingredient diet food for small breeds. He's a pug with allergies and has never had a problem with these treats or the kibble.I recommend trying these with your pet. Get them from your local pet store for a much better price."
8,"My male cat has a lot of allergies.  I've tried using many products to boost his immune system and add luster to his coat.  I also happen to show dogs and use the Nupro Gold on my show line of animals with great results so I decided to try cat nuggets.  WONDERFUL.  At first my male cat wasn't to keen on eating it. the female gobbled it down.  After a few days he ate it fine.  I just sprinkle a 1/2 teaspoon on their individual breakfast.  You can also mash it up into can food.  Male cat no longer has the runs. coat looks amazing. and no allergy issues taking this supplement.  (He's allergic to grain and certain cat litters).  Female cat also looks amazing but she never had much of an issue looking fab!"
8,"This product is great for about 1-2 years. Over time. the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets' fur and food. which causes the motor to break down. even with regular cleaning. I found no way to purchase a replacement motor. so I was really bummed (as were my cats!).I ended up purchasing a new fountain. but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food. fur. and other particles from getting into the motor and its' reservoir."
8,"I've wanted to buy one of these fountains for my kitties for years.Last week it was one of the Deals on Amazon. so I splurged and bought a $25 gift for my kitties!They love it. I like having it there. it makes barely any noise. just a light trickle. The kitties love it. drink from it and play with the water stream.It's got a nice long cord. though I need an extension to put it where I want it. I like the on/off switch on the cord. and the water filter. It came with extra filters. at least a year's supply. Great value."
8,"I gave this to my mother for Christmas. She has an old cat who loves to play in water and she had always talked about some day getting him a pet water fountain. I had read a few other reviews and was a little leery as to how well this would work. but gave it a try.Her cat loves it! From day 1 there have been no problems with it. And best of all. it VERY quiet. You can't hear it at all! She has it set up in her living room. I didn't even know it was there.I would just make sure you always have it filled with water so the pump doesn't burn out on you. Because cats drink so much water with this. when you first get it. you should watch the water levels so that you get an idea on how often you should replenish the water supply.Absolutely great product!"
8,"I have four dogs. This fountain. even the jumbo size. couldn't keep up with them. The pump died in less than a year. despite regular cleansing of the unit about every two week.Cleansing this unit is NOT a snap. and the pump intake clogs with dog drool/hair/debris.You have to dissamble the whole contraption to really cleanse it well. the ENTIRE inside/interior gets coated with slime if you don't.So. tonight I'm purchasing another fountain. My dog has been diagnosed with chronic kidney failure. and the vet has said make sure he drinks a LOT of water.So. I'm back to the drawing board.One thing though. our dogs did LOVE to drink from this. I just wish it could have stood the pressure of all four of them using it. For the record. I have a labrador and three beagles. It wasn't as if I expected it to stand up to four Newfoundlands!"
8,"I recieved this fountain in the mail approximately 2 weeks. ago. so I will enter a new review later if my opinion changes...That said. this is a great fountain so far.  Fairly easy to assemble. extremely quiet (almost silent). and very easy to refill...you can leave it running. remove the water container. refill and replace without having to turn the unit off.That said. it is not the petmate 'deluxe' model..no in-line power switch. no flow adjustment valve... so. don't buy this if you are looking for those features.Only time will tell if the pump continues to work as silently and as quietly as it has so far. but as of now. this is a good purchase for the money...given the mistake in labeling it as 'deluxe'.  It is still at least $10.00 cheaper than the same model at my local pet chain store."
8,"It does what it's supposed to. but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad. but it vibrates. So by itself. the motor is quiet. but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap. maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe. until the motor finally just quit after a few years. and it was great. This one. not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself. making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment. and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it."
8,"My cat loves her fountain !!  She really likes to drink right from the little hole at the top where the water comes out.  The only complaint I have about this item is the frequent cleaning.  I guess cats just naturally get saliva in their water. and this fountain will need to be cleaned about weekly. otherwise. your cat isn't getting that nice. fresh water you were thinking about when you bought it.  I take the fountain outside and give it a good wash with a little soap and bleach. (and of course a good rinse) and it's good to go.  Sometimes I put ice cubes in the bowl. which the cat really likes. Be sure to check the little grille over the pump intake for cat hair.I've had this for over a year and it's still working fine."
8,"I've had my Fresh Flow for a few years now and the unit works well. In fact. I purchased one for my mother's pets. I'm giving this fountain two stars because within the last year. the company has changed their filter replacements to this cheap piece of garbage that has barely any charcoal in it and slimes up quick. The new filters cost the same but now you have to replace them more often. I would think a cheaper product deserved a cheaper price. especially if you have to replace them more often. Check out the filters here on Amazon. you'll see I'm not the only one dissatisfied. Because of this. I am switching over to the Drinkwell system. I've checked out their filter system and it looks a bit more substantial."
8,"I've had this unit for over a year and while I like it better than a plain bowl of water. there are some flaws.The blue reservoir is growing algae in the corners and because of its shape. it's impossible to clean those spots. I also have hard water in my apartment. so the slide gets a lot of hardwater build up which doesn't come off with scrubbing. Finally. the thing is always getting clogged up with cat hair and weekly cleanings are necessary if you don't want your cat drinking gross hairy water.I will likely purchase the type of fountain that comes down like a faucet whenever this one breaks but I won't buy this one again."
8,"This Petmate medium size water fountain has turned out to be a very good item compared to the last Petmate medium one that I had bought several years ago.  This has a slightly more powerful water pump compared to my last one.  The water filters with the fountain is the only thing that slows the water flow down too much after a few days of running.  Their filters are quite thick in substance for the water to flow through.  I have found that the small Whisper brand of water filters for the fish tanks work real well with this water fountain versus using Petmates filters."
8,"Purchased this Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow a couple of weeks ago. It makes a soft running water noise. pleasant to hear. My cat immediately started drinking from it. as she loves running water. Keeps water fresh and clean for her. easy to reload - just unhook the cord from the plug and take to sink. Makes a loud noise when there is debris in it (bugs. food. whatever) to let you know it must be cleaned out! so much easier than refilling the water dish all the time..."
8,"My cats love this.  The moving water actually helps cool it off which my cats prefer.  Since buying it 8 months ago. both of my cats have ceased drinking from the toilet bowl after I flush it (they love that cool. moving water).  Yes. it accumlates fur. but as long as you clean it thoroughly once a week (takes 5-10 minutes). everything is fine.  The motor is incredibly quiet if you have the item assembled properly .  After taking it apart and putting it back together. sometimes you have to do it again if it is noisy.  Not a big deal since THE CATS LOVE IT!The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter is AFTER the motor... so it doesn't filter out any fur or other gunk from the motor.... which is why you have to disassemble the motor (VERY easy) in your cleaning process once a week."
8,"We bought this for our cat a couple weeks ago and it has been great. I really wasn't too sure of what to expect. but figured we'd give it a shot. It's less than $30 so why not right? It was slightly confusing putting everything where it belonged because the directions in the box are for the one you're getting as well as their deluxe kit. which you are to skip over. After it was all done and running. our cat couldn't wait to check it out! Right away he was drinking the water and sometimes at night I catch him trying to play/fish in it! It really doesn't make much noise at all. The sound of the water stream is actually pretty soothing. If it makes any noise then you need to fill up the water reservoir. I have no problems with this and I love the fact that it's filtering his water. We all love it!"
8,"I purchased this Jumbo drinking fountain to make sure my cats would drink more water.  More water they drink the less I have to worry about with urinary infections.  All my cats love this fountain.  Some drink at the bottom tray and others will drink from the top where the water is just coming out.It keeps the water cool all the time.  My only problem is when my 2 Labs come into the house and when they drink they will devour the whole thing and I have to watch to make sure that the water does not get below motor.So far I have had this fountain for about 6 months and it is very quiet. easy to install and easy to clean.Julie"
8,"I have 2 Dachshunds and a cat and this fountain is perfect. Purchased a different fountain and it stopped working after a few days. This fountain got great reviews. that's the reason why I got it and I'm very pleased with it. My pets have no trouble drinking out of it and they have fresh water all of the time. I do empty the water out and wash the bowl twice a week to get out the junk that the dogs' leave from drinking. which I would do with any bowl. Other than that. I'm sold!"
8,"It's great to have flowing water for cats.  My cats love running water from the faucet.  The water in this fountain is not running. though. but flows down a slope. so it's difficult for the cats to even see the water running.  My cats didn't drink from the part where the water was running.  I later bought a different flowing water pet fountain that runs more like a faucet. but we no longer use that one either because it is plastic and our vet recommended that cats should only eat and drink out of glass bowls. not plastic.  Apparently the plastic containers can cause irritations.  One of my cats had a swollen lip and the vet suspected the plastic water dish as the culprit.  Too bad no one has made a glass flowing water fountain!"
8,"I've found that almost all cats strongly prefer to drink running water as opposed to still water. Cat eyes are attracted to motion. My cats drink much more often from a fountain than a water dish which makes me feel better about their health. Cats love this thing. the only cons are from the human maintenance side of things.Cons: A water fountain is more work than filling up a dish. You must plug it in. turn it on. clean the pump. replace the filter. and refill the resevoir often. This does get annoying but is not a problem unqiue to this fountain. and to me it's definitely worth it for my cats.The fountain is pleasant looking. a perfect size. and very quiet."
8,"I had purchased the Petmate Deluxe model of the 50-ounce Pet Fountain for my cats. That works exactly as described and my cats drink more than they did from bowls of water around the house. I like blue. and the basic model seemed as if it would perform the same as the deluxe model. My cats still drink from this model. but it doesn't fit together as well as the deluxe model and. as a result. it often leaks. leaving puddles around it. If I purchase another. I will only get the Deluxe model."
8,"I've had two of these fountains. and several family members also have them.  Yes. weird things happen. and at least one was returned to company with pump problems.  For whatever reason. they do not include the following information routinely in their packaging.  For a pdf that illustrates routine cleaning. and some FAQ's. go to: [...]  You need to take the pump apart and despite the instructions in pdf. use the pointed type q-tips. a wire cake tester. in-between-teeth cleaner brush(really). you get the idea. to clean it inside and out! My cats love this fountain. but we joke that one of them has a 'drinking problem.' because she likes to belly-up at front of fountain and drink from waterfall. resulting in a drenched bib.  The pdf should address many of the common complaints about this product.  Good luck!"
8,"I bought a bubbler water thing for my cats for the bedroom. but the bubbler was way too noisy so I long ago ditched the bubbling parts.  I've been wanting to get a fountain in there. but wanted something quiet.  I thought this Petmate fountain would be quiet since the water doesn't drop far from the spout and I was right.  The only sound I hear on the level it's on now is a low hum from the motor that is no bother at all.  The cats are used to the Drinkwell fountain in the livingroom.  It took them just a few minutes to check out the Petmate and now they seem to drink out of it more than the silent bubbler thing.  My only wish is that I'd have bought the large or jumbo size for a bigger dish and reservoir.  With 5 cats I have to fill the little reservoir bottle up every night."
8,"I thought this would be the perfect solution for my sink drinkers.  They do like to drink out of this fountain.  The best feature of this is the quiet motor. you can hardly hear it when more than a few feet away.  the problem is that the motor starts to grind as soon as the water level goes down. which in our house is every day.  So i find myself filling it all the time.  You also have to have filters on hand.  And it gets grimy quickly.  I have several animals. so maybe if you have only one or two. it would not be as much of an issue.  all in all. not a bad product. but could use a little improvement."
8,"I bought this for my older cats last year and they had no interest in it so I stopped using it.  They are gone now and I have a new set of cats.  They are fine with it and like how the water flows around.  The item has worked fine for me but I do have to put water in it every morning.  Easy to do. I just pour a paper cup full into the bowl.  If I don't it makes a lot of noise. quiet when full.  Still I like it and don't worry about it very much.  Clean it about every month and that is fine."
8,"I've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now. tending to get a couple of years of use out of them.  For the price. the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump. it seems reasonable to me.  I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow. is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it.  Those are its pros. along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes).  However. I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning. which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so)."
8,"My cat thinks this fountain is fantastic. which is what really matters.  I'm sure she'd give it five stars. but she's not the one who has to clean it.  There are a few areas that are hard to reach with a sponge. so I bought a baby bottle cleaner which does help in reaching some of the places I just can't fit my hand.  The mineral deposits get pretty gross on the ramp the water flows down. so you do need to scrub the fountain fairly frequently.  Overall. it's a good product that's designed so the cat can't tip it over.  I do wish I'd bought a larger size (I have the medium) because I have to refill it often.  As it starts to need water. it makes a loud swishing noise that turns into a horrific sucking sound when it gets really low."
8,"I was concerned from other reviews that it might be too noisy-after the pump fills and starts the waterfall. it is very quiet. almost inaudible. All of my cats love drinking out of it. I clean it weekly. which admittedly isn't as easy as cleaning a plain water bowl. but I think it's worth the extra 10 minutes. It's funny as now they wait for me to put the fountain back vs. drinking out of a plain bowl. I use the filtered water from my refrigerator and the charcoal filters that came w/ it. The customer service from Entirely [...] was wonderful and this item arrived in a few days. I now shop directly at their web store since they carry CNET dental cat chews that really clean their teeth-Greenies get gobbled too quickly w/o any dental effect."
8,"We have one of these and one Drinkwell. and the kitties seem equally happy with either one. The Petmate is a bit quieter. but is even more difficult to clean. which needs to be done more often than I'd like. Neither one is a day at the beach to clean. but the Petmate has even more little nooks and crannies and narrow little spots that are almost impossible to get the gunk out of. And as soon as you're done and fill it with fresh water. it starts getting icky again before you know it. Since there's no obvious useful purpose for all the little hard to reach spots. I can only conclude that whoever designed these things likes cats OK. but hates their owners."
8,"- 'Problems. Problems. Problems All Day Long' Like the old Everly Brothers song. this product has been nothing but ongoing problems. The little tank in the back never drains properly. the fountain doesn't run well for more than a day without some kind of an assist. the little screen that's supposed to catch debris before it's pulled into the filtration system is a nightmare to remove and reinstall......and so it goes on and on.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! I should have sent it back. but I'm usually very handy with gadgets of all kinds. and just kept believing I could make this 'lemon' work well. I was wrong this time. DON'T BUY THIS ONE... GET SOMETHING IN CERAMIC OR STAINLESS STEEL INSTEAD. FROM ANOTHER COMPANY !!! PETMATE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT!"
8,"I have always used the Pet Mate water fountains for my pets.  When one of their last ones wore out. I bought one of these AspenPet Cool Flow Pet Fountains.  It wasn't near as quiet as the Pet Mate ones I was was used to.  I put a thick plush throw rug under it and that helped a lot.  It does have a powerful filter system on it.  To reduce the sound. I changed the filter to a filter that is a slight bit thinner and that did help too."
8,"The first two days this fountain worked great. Both my cat and I were very happy with it. On day 3 the pump started making strange noises. I checked the troubleshooting and pulled it apart to make sure the pump was not what was rattling. (It wasn't) Also the unit seemed to be leaking water out of the middle where it is attached. Right now... the pump is out and my cat is once again having to deal with standing water only. So much for this solving that problem.I bought another one of these and the problems with the first one were gone. I must have gotten a lemon the first time. The pump on the new one is quiet. Now if my cat wasn't so suspicious of the flowing water. my life would be easier. I updated my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars."
8,"I had this for less than three days. The first day it was great.  I wish it gurgled more for the cat but it was fine.  The last day I noticed that it seemed to be going through water quickly for one cat.  Then I noticed the throw rug was saturated.  Then i noticed the discoloration of the hardwood floors.  Then i noticed the wet spot in the basement.  I checked to see if the water container was screwed on correctly.  Then i placed it on a dry towel on the kitchen counter.  Within an hour the towel was saturated.  Luckily I bought it at Walmart.  Back it went but instead of putting it aside so that some other poor peeson would not be sold this piece of crap.  They put it aside to be reshelved.  I wish I could give this 0 stars.If this fails on you it could do major damage before you discover it."
8,"I have two cats. one was a little scared at first. but the other one took right to it and will even lay beside it on occassion when it is hot.  Now they both love it. when I first set it up. it did make a sound. but after a week when I went to clean it. I realized that is makes that sound if it is not completely full.  Now the loud sound that others complain about is gone. you have to make sure that not just the reserve part of the fountain is full but also the main container level matches water level as well. Cleaning it once a week is best. since fur can get caught as well as food bits in the main fountain.  But it is a really good fountain. it was so good that I got one for my moms new kitten!"
8,"Clearly when you get these if you have ever purchased a small. medium. large or xl cat box you will soon find this would be small for a tiny kitten. It is more a tub to keep pens and art supplies in than a simple and functional litter box. I checked the measurements prior to purchase with another of my boxes but when it arrived. it was no where near a cat box size. Having said that. if it had been a usable simple litter box and not a storage tub without a lid. then I suppose it would have been okay. Nothing special. No frills. Just a box. Maybe for emergency travel or one-off situations where nothing else is available. but you would be better off in that situation to use a box flat and a kitty liner. Sadly I missed the return date by one day (I will call Amazon tomorrow to discuss) due to illness so now I may be stuck with two unusable boxes."
8,"This is in no way a Giant cat litter pan. lol. I ordered it based on the description that it was larger than large-that it was giant. I have a cat on the larger side and thought this would be bigger than the large pans found in pet stores.It's not.I ordered a large cat litter pan from amazon for $5.99 that is larger than this one.The pan is of nice quality though. I think it would be perfect for a medium sized kitty.I'll be returning this. False advertising is a pet peeve."
8,"My female kitty had an UTI and the vet ordered her the VET-only supplied UTI food at a very high price. She didn't eat it at all. neither the dry nor the wet kind.So I bought some of this Pro Plan UT Focus formula. She eats it - not exactly with great pleasure - but she eats it and since weeks we had no more problems. As mentioned by many other customers. the &#34;cheaper&#34; food is as good as the one that the vet tries to sell with a big profit. I recommend it anytime."
8,"I purchased the Purina Pro Plan Sensitive Skin and Stomach Formula as two of my five cats have very dry skin above the tail.  I knew they needed extra omega vitamins as I've been feeding them the Hiarball Conrol Formula.  This is made with lamb as the first ingredient.  I don't think I've ever seen the five of them eat dry food up so quickly!  It seems that I'm always refilling their bowls.  The dry skin seems to be better after 2-3 weeks of eating this formula.  One of the cats still is some flaking. but it is much better.  Perhaps it takes awhile to completely go away.I received this very quickly as always."
8,"Same product as Purina One. different bag. I even had the kibbles to compare side by side and they look identical (shape. size. color. smell). Our cat would not eat the Purina One so we got him this one. He won't touch it either.Ingredients list is almost identical. I think they swapped a 2 ingredients' places in the line. to make it look different when really they are about the same amount and the same formula.Rip off! If your cat loves this. get Purina One. you'll save about half the cost!"
8,"PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product. Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat. Most of these food contain-1 - Chicken By-Product Meal -- 'dry. ground. rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass.'2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat.3 - Animal Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E.4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that's a protein corn by-product; it's a little deficient in lysine. so it shouldn't be the only protein source. which it isn't. (Yes. your pet can digest it just fine).5 - Brewers Rice -- another by-product. leftovers from the milling process.Please consider Grain-fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain-free obviously doesn't contain grains. leftover meats. and the price is almost the same as these cheap 'craps'."
8,"Due to work. I had cats in South Africa for two months before they were transported to Venezuela.  I was afraid they wouldn't like the new food or get sick. since I didn't have the food they were used to previously.Both cats took to the food quickly and really enjoy it.  No tummy issues. but I do always recommend that if you are switching food. do so by adding a little more of the ProPlan and less of their previous food during a week's time.I am happy becuase I know they are eating healthy.  As a treat. I also give them wet food once a day.  Dry food is there all day."
8,"I dont care what the vet said he/she also say nothing of the side affect when giving your pet shots and whenever you ask a question it should take 3 minutes to answer but they are busy and only say a few seconds worth UTI's arent cause by a food but ingredient cats NEED water but not water from a bowl cats in the wild get water from meats they eat so they dont drink much causing stress on organs especially on the bladder a kidneys so I feed cut up raw chicken breast very small every 2 days and also feed wet every other day and you MUST have a grain free food to fully stop organ and body problems such as infections pains joints anything even shedding yes shedding is controlled by food so get a good food you can afford yet your cat can live and not survive on vet only get a few hours of nutrition classes provided by Science Diet so dont ask them about brands go research and look even Newman owns is good so id evolve to name a few local store brands"
8,"One of my cats was having issues with UTIs. After numerous vet visits due to recurring UTIs I decided to give Purina Pro Plan Urinary Tract Health a try since my cat refused to eat the prescription food the vet recommended. To my surprise. she didn't have any issues eating this brand (she's quite a picky eater) and it cured her UTI. This was about a year ago and she hasn't had another UTI since! Although it's dry food. it's not dry like typically brands. It's more moist which is what you want to help with UTIs. It doesn't seem to have any effect on my other cat who doesn't have any issues with UTIs which means that I don't have to try to feed them different food."
8,"My 13-year-old Persian thinks this stuff is pretty good.  He has that disease. Lymphocytic-Plasmacytic Gingivitis Stomatitis. which means he had to have all of his teeth removed since they attack his body. but doesn't have any trouble getting these down.  He usually eats mostly wet food but he enjoys this dry food quite a bit.  Plus. he doesn't toss up his lunch anymore since buying these which. in my opinion. is the best part.  The price is fair here on amazon too - it's higher in the local stores here in Ohio.  Recommend!"
8,"I have a 2 year old male tabby and a 6 year old female tuxedo cat. Both of them are slightly overweight so I started feeding them this dry cat food a year ago. 4 month ago my male cat developed urinary track blockage (crystal) so we have to keep him on canned food diet. We couldn't be sure the exact cause of the blockage (food. stress. genetic...) My female cat would not eat canned food so we let her keep eating Pro Plan's Weight Management dry food.Now my female cat got urinary track  blockage as well!  I am kicking myself have been keeping her on this dry food.Do not feed your cat this food. Urinary track blockage is very costly to treat. Once they get it. it could be a life long battle. Be carful!"
8,"I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer. as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food. but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once. though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under. and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom. and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake. they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it. i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying."
8,"This food has the weirdest texture I have ever come across. Out of 3 cats only 2 will eat it. Hemmey the fat boy wouldn't even try it. He walked away instantly. I have to use a different spoon as he won't touch anything  that has come in contact w/ it. It reminds me of potted meat & the texture is disgusting. For $1.87 a can I will look elsewhere . but I have to buy the 13oz cans when feeding 3 cats. Not to many choices w/ free shipping. Guess I will have to feed them canned food that isn't grain free."
8,"I rated this product as I did because it may have a little dust but not near as much as others I have used... The price is right on this product being it is delivered in 2 days to my door... I choose the 14 lb box as my litter box is upstairs and it's a pain to haul the bigger boxes up the steps... One other thing I find the smaller box good for is storing the used litter until I fill the box.... I can then carry the used litter downstairs to dispose.... I wash the litter box a couple times a month and 14 lbs fill it nicely... My cats are not picky about scented or unscented and I have used both with good results..."
8,"After receiving the product in the mail. I read the package that this bone is made of nylon and contrary to description. it is NOT edible.I left my 20 pound dog chew on it and after a few hours it was already scrapped and used-up. I usually leave her playing with the bone for an hour or so. and she began to feel really sick in the morning.Last night I let her play with the bone for a couple of hours during dinner. and this morning she threw up and was very sick. This bone made my dog sick. so it's going in the garbage and getting a bad review."
8,"I got this in the mail today. sent using Amazon prime. It got here in less than 48 hours so that aspect was great.I purchased this for my dog after my friend's dog stayed for the weekend and my dog ended up loving his smaller version of this chew toy (she shredded the ends of it). So far my dog really likes this. She is a 35lb terrier/beagle/pit bull mutt who can destroy one of the medium sized nyla bones in a month. so I thought I'd give it a try. I will amend the review if I have any problems later. but so far it's great :)After about an hour of chewing today. she already did shred one end of it a bit (more than she is able to do in an hour on a new nyla bone) but I'm sure it will provide her plenty of use before it's destroyed. 5/5 so far"
8,"My pets love their snuggle mate.  I bought mine about 7 years ago and it is still going strong.  My cats love to snuggle with it.  I am now looking to purchase one for our dog's crate (for in the car).  For the people who have had problems with theirs...you really must be more careful with the wattage your microwave puts out. If not. it appears that people have warped theirs. started fires and other problems.  One must really use products safely in order for them to be safe for their home and pets.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a safe pet warmer without wires and that is virtually chew proof.  We will find out if it is actually chew proof once our 6 month old puppy gets one for Christmas :-)"
8,"I got this for a baby prairie dog to keep him warm while he was in his cage. I ended up just getting a pouch and holding him most of the day since he refused to sleep on this. That isnt due to this being a bad product though. It holds heat nicely without being too hot and the fleece is very soft and really keeps it so its warm instead of being HOT. I would highly recommend it for any animal in need of some warmth! Also it does stay heated for 12 hours like it claims."
8,"We have a family of feral strays that we care for. We bought Snuggle Safe to tuck into their outside bedding to keep them warm during freezes this past winter.I was skeptical.Following directions. then placing the heated disk underneath their blankets in their &#34;cat house&#34;. I was AMAZED to find that. 15 hours later. heat was still generating from it.We used this disk all winter and it still works great. The heat will last much longer if you make sure to wrap it in a towel or keep it insulated in some way. so that it emits a low heat all night through."
8,"I've had this for years. and it still works as well as it did the first time I used it. There's not many products one can say that about! Simple to use (just microwave it for a few minutes) and the heat output lasts for several hours outdoors; about 12 or more hours indoors.One of my cats is arthritic. and this really helps her joints. especially in the colder months. While it does take more effort to prep than a plug-in cat bed. I feel that is more than offset by the fact that you're not tied to an outlet (can locate it anywhere) plus I don't have to worry about shorts or other electrical problems.I've even used it myself a few times when I've had sore muscles and needed some heat therapy.Highly recommend!"
8,"I have used one of these for years and bought this one recently.  The quality is the same.  I am the caretaker for a spayed/neutered & vaccinated small feral cat colony.  I heat these in the microwave one at a time before I take the cats' water and warmed food out to them.  The water goes on top of one disc and the food atop the other.  In this cold weather. minus 10 to 20 degrees. these discs keep the food and water from freezing for about an hour. long enough for the cats to get there and eat and drink."
8,"First of all. make sure you know the wattage of your microwave oven. Ours is old and so we are guessing on how long to heat this. We bought the SnuggleSafe Microwave Heatpad to use with the Kitty Tube. However. this product does NOT fit through the Kitty Tube door. therefore the top of the Kitty Tube must be removed to put the SnuggleSafe inside. This not only allows cold air to rush into the Kitty Tube but also totally freaks feral cats out and often they will not return to use the Kitty Tube for days. if ever. Unfortunately. we do not have an outside outlet to use the electric heating pad that can be used instead of the SnuggleSafe so we must rely solely on straw for kitty warmth."
8,"I bought this heating pad for my miniature dachshund who is always cold and loves to burrow under blankets.  After heating the pad up for 6 minutes (it comes with a sheet that tells you how long to heat depending on your microwave) the pad stayed quite warm for at least 8 hours.  My dog will snuggle up to it if I cover it up with blankets but by itself (even with the fleece cover it comes with) it is still pretty hard and apparently unappealing to her.  I do wish the pad was a little softer so she would like it more but at least it is sturdy enough that she can't chew it up.  The pad does come with its own fleece cover so don't bother buying another one unless you want extra or if they make something thicker and softer to put it inside.  If your dog or cat is not picky about what they snuggle up to this is a great item to keep their bed or kennel warm."
8,"My aunt suggested this product when I mentioned that I was thinking of getting a heated pet bed.  Fortunately my cat Guy took to this right away. He's an older boy. recently adopted from the Humane Society.  He gets the shivers when he lays on our cold floors.  It takes him forever to stop shivering. even when I hold him under a blanket.  He can be nervous though--I just bought him a cushy pet bed that he refuses to lay on.  So I was worried he wouldn't like the disk. but honestly. it's bringing him more bliss than catnip!  Another thing to note is that it does come with a cover--I wasn't sure that it did since the photo didn't show one."
8,"I love this and my Sphynx cats do too. but the big drawback is that it feels like a rock and doesn't soften up. The cats would like it better if it were soft.  Follow the instructions carefully-I was concerned that my Sphynx might get burned so I put an extra cover on it.  Saying that. I want to emphasize that the warmer does not come out of the microwave hot-it comes out nice and warm and is able somehow to maintain that warmth for maybe 10 hours."
8,"I have been very happy with my Snuggle Safe heat pad. The claims of 10-12 hours of heat are true IF you insulate it a bit. OK. it cools off in 4 hours or so if you leave it sitting out. but under a blanket. it stays toasty for a good 10 hours (I don't think I have every checked it after 12 hours. but I expect it would still be a bit warm).Granted. my cats are not much interested (maybe they will be when the weather gets cold again). but I love it. I stick it at the foot of the bed (under the covers. so it stays warm). or even just hold it while I am reading in the evening.  I also got one for my Mom. who has Reynaud's Syndrome. and she says it is great. She just keeps it nearby and warms her hands as needed."
8,"My dog LOVES heat so I thought this would be perfect to put in her cage while we are at work. I buried it underneath the blankets. and had the blue cover over it. She ripped off the blue cover and chewed all the way around the warmer. and punctured it so I can't use it at all.Now I'm stuck with the blue cover. paw print cover. and dog stuffed animal.The warmer is a lot harder than I thought it was. so I can see how some dogs wouldn't find it very comfortable to lay on. but if you use the stuffed animal the heat doesn't go through it very well.The one good thing is I was surprised at how long it stayed warm."
8,"I bought the first one and the cat liked it. Do not over microwave. it will melt. The trick to having it last 8 hours is the pets bed.I am using this for a mini doxie. 5.5 lbs. I bought her a tunnel bed. and she wears a light sweater. with the snuggle in her bed she is not waking me up to put it inthe microwave at 3 am.Mini dogs have to be kept warm. they die fast. I micro this and put in her car crate when we travel around town."
8,"I bought this for a feral cat I am taming.  She is in a room that gets a bit chilly at night.  It stays warm most of the night.  There have been times when I come back in the morning that it is cold. but also times that it is still warm.  The only thing that would make it completely perfect is if it were more flat and maybe softer.  I put blankets around and over it to make it a little more comfortable.  This is a great product!"
8,"I have owned three of these for about 5 years. They warm nicely in the microwave but do not stay warm all night long! No way do they stay warm 12 hours. More like 6 hours. The price has skyrocketed since I purchased my first one a few years ago. I am pretty sure the first one was only $9.99. I think the second one was $19.99. They are way over priced. I find they do not heat up well after only 6 minutes of heating Nd as I mentioned. I have three of them an d not one of them stays warm for 12 hours. Maybe a larger one needs to be created for a multiple cat use but still heating issues would be a problem."
8,"THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS!  I bought this for my Airedale's crate at night.  I thought it would be nice to radiate a little heat  (during these chilly winter months)  under her top towel. and on top of her cushion and blanket.  SHE LOVES IT. and has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning!!!  This disc is very hard. but she doesn't seem to mind (and I put it under a thick towel).  It actually stays warm for about 8-10 hours.  and I microwave only 5 mins and 15 secs. which is slightly under the recommended time for my microwave.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
8,"I am really liking this product after all.  I was not sure it would stay warm for long. but it really does.  I have not determined how long yet. but hours more than anything I have ever used.  I put it outside under a blanket in a small house to keep a cat warm. and I think tonight was the first she was on it!  Even if the cat does not like it in the end (I had an electric warmer before and she was afraid and would not go in the house) I am keeping it to warm my bed before I get under the covers!"
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
8,"Multiple times I have heated the SnuggleSafe according to the directions. and the pad never gets hot enough to generate enough heat to penetrate the fleece cover.  It doesn't radiate heat the way I had hoped it would.  I'm afraid to overheat the pad in the microwave (as the instructions caution against). and I worry the pad will be too hot for my pet if I remove the pad from the cover.  I should have thought better about buying the SnuggleSafe anyway - from the pictures it's obviously very hard and probably not comfortable to lie on.  (If you pad it more. then the heat will never get through to your pet.)  My cat has no interest in it."
8,"I bought 2 of these for my cats for Christmas. They are great and the cats just love them.  It did not take them long to figure out that the disks are warm and they snuggled right up to them.  My cats are indoor cats but I figure on the coldest days it is always nice to get some extra warmth.  I also had to get one out before Christmas because I had a sick cat that needed to go to the vet.  I fits perfect in the carrier and I did not need to worry that my sick cat was going to get chilled.  I love the fact that there are no cords and the cover that comes with it is great also to keep a barrier between the cat and the disk. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to give their pet some extra warmth without cords.  The disk stays warm for a good 12 hours so you only need to microwave it twice a day.  Great idea and gread product!"
8,"I thought it'd be a nice heating pad for my dog when it got cold because there were no wires. He sleeps on the landing of the stairs outside of my bedroom.  This is a  hard plastic disc and I heated it up for my dog. hid it under his blankets. He has a nice area where he sleeps at night. I was super excited for him. Went to shower and came out to check on him and my little 17 pound beagle carried the heating pad up the stairs and dropped it off in front of my door and was back in his bed curled up. I got the hint. he didn't want it."
8,"This product does what it says it will do but you have to be careful about overheating. I put it in a microwave for about nine minutes and it warped the bottom which weakened it. and in another two heatings it leaked. Rather expensive Frisbee at this point.It does hold heat very well and the large flattish shape is comfortable for pets but I am not replacing it. I got some quart plastic kefir bottles that are heavier than most milk bottles and fill them with hot water and heat. They do almost as good a job and are free when I'm done with the beverage. Not suggesting you don't buy this product but the instructions made it sound like you had to heat it three times longer than recommended before there was a problem. I was nowhere near that long and it failed."
8,"All of my cats love this food. and the 12 and a half ounce can is perfect for my 4 kitties. Something about this flavor attracts my dogs. and I need to keep them away from it. Which a can of Wellness dog food usually does the trick. Wellness brand is by far the best in regard to both dry and wet food. and I've tried them all. Though more expensive than some other brands. the litter boxes are cleaner and less smelly. This product goes a long way. so in the end the cost justifies itself immediately. We are all Very Happy with this product."
8,"My kittens love this food and they certainly seem to be growing at healthy rate. My adult male cat doesn't really eat it but he's always preferred dry food so I buy this for the younger ones and their mother.  Mom and the litter were abandoned so I'm not sure what she was fed before but she seems to really like the food and its put some much needed weight on her. They seem to really like this flavor and the beef and chicken. Both are a bit smellier and oiler then the others but that's probably what they like."
8,"What a great cat food. The ingredients list speaks for itself. My cat developed IBD. and couldn't eat dry food anymore without vomiting. Some brands of wet food were fine. some were not. and the ones that were (like Fancy Feast) didn't seem very nutritious. I switched her to Wellness. and she hasn't vomited in over three months. Although it's more expensive than dry food. it's not that much more expensive than most wet foods. when you buy it here from Amazon in bulk. My cat loves it (but she loves everything). she's been very healthy. and it's saved me tons of money in medical expenses."
8,"My cat is very peculiar about food. He does not like a lot of flavors. but this one is a winner! When I look for cat food. my main concern is the quality. Looking at the first ingredient is great. but reading through the rest of them might seem to be overwhelming. but I do that as well. Wellness presents as an outstanding product. I recently found out that cheap cat food brands like IAMS etc. use food flavoring and additives to make the food smell better than natural products. so it took my cat a few tries before he was convinced of the quality of this product :)"
8,"We feed one can of this per day to our three cats. They really enjoy the food and always come running when we are getting the can out of the cabinet.We chose this particular food because it's one of the cheapest grain-free wet foods that we can get that still maintains a quality product. We have one diabetic cat and do not want the other two progressing that direction. so we switched over to grain-free to help control blood sugar.We've been using this brand for several years now and have never gotten a bad bag of dry food or an expired lot of wet food. Would highly recommend to those watching what their cats are eating!"
8,"I switched from Advantix II to this b/c the ticks around here are bad in the summer but in the end. none of them worked. What I have been using and it has worked since is Pet Naturals spray which is a mix of natural products and you simply spray the dog before a walk and it prevents the ticks from attaching to the dog in the first place and that has worked and I have been using it for years. The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus. Also a little drop of apple cider or vinegar on their treat is another natural repellant and great for their immune system. During peak seasons of ticks when it is warm ill drop some on their treats once every week and even that little amount helps."
8,"I used to use this to protect my large German shepherd mix up until the day he passed away at 15.5 years old.  He never had any issues with fleas while on this product.I recently adopted two small dogs. about 20 pounds each.  I use one packet to treat both of them.  I bought some 1 cc syringes and some dispensing needles and just split the content of one pack evenly between my two dogs.  Saves me a lot of money AND they get a proper dosage of the medicine."
8,"I love Frontline Plus for my cats. but it gets expensive. And then when I moved to a new neighborhood I found a few stray cats too. Before finding them new homes. I had to use flea control meds and it definitely got expensive.  I'm so glad this was created.  I just hope that something like this can be created for the oral medication for Program too.  I have some feral cats I can't touch and mixing Program in with their food is the only thing I can do. and that gets pricey too.  I'm very blessed I make good money. but still..."
8,"This is a great product--it does work very well. My vets assistant told me if I buy Frontline from Amazon I am NOT getting a legit product as it is only sold to vets. While it is true it is only sold to vets..it is NOT true that the vets office is the ONLY place you can get a legit product.I emailed Merial and they confirmed I did indeed buy a legit product from Amazon. Go to the Merial web site--email them. as I did and they will give you a phone number to call so you can verify whether or not you have a legit product.I am not saying don't be careful...please do..but I buy Frontline Plus from Amazon..it works and it is legit."
8,"Ok. so I have a Scottish Terrier that has severe flea allergy and we have used frontlineplus for almost 4 years with no problems. and not one flea.The past few months that I have used this recent order from amazon.com she got fleas at the end of themonth.  I am assuming either I got a bad batch. or it didn't work the full month.Either way. I am scared to use frontline plus for her anymore.  She got huge sores. whelps. hairloss and it cost me 150.00 in vet bills as well as more money buying other prevention and differentshampoos for her."
8,"I typically purchase flea products from my vet and normally get Frontline for the dogs.  For whatever reason this didn't seem to work as well.  It appears to be the same product but for the first time in years we ended up with fleas.  I went to the vet about 30 days after I noticed the first flea (and after realizing we were starting to have a real problem) and purchased Frontline from them and applied it to the dogs.  After just 2 weeks I've noticed - no more fleas.  I do not know if the infestation was a direct result of buying this product online but I wont take the chance again."
8,"Shipping was fast. got it within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  Says that it stops all stages of fleas. and kills and protects against chewing lice and ticks as well - I'm not sure about the chewing lice and ticks. but I did find fleas on my Lab puppy when I got him.  I use this on him. and within two weeks I didn't find any on him at all. not even after I bathe him and used a flea comb on him.  Says it works up to a month. and is water-proof.I'd highly recommend."
8,"I have been using Frontline plus on my dog for all of his 6 years of life and he has NEVER had a single flea or tick on him. He attends doggy daycare where they have had flea outbreaks in the past but he has never been effected. Based on this history of the product working well and preventing any flea issues I feel it is definitely worth it to continue to use this product every month. I have also compared the benefits of this product with other flea and tick products and this seems to be the best you can get. The health of and well being of my dog is just as important as my own so I will continue to use this product as it has been successful for my dogs whole life and I have confidence that the product truly works."
8,"'Frontline' is considered the best and most effective flea & tick control product on the marketplace.  Sure. you will see other brands that cost much less than 'Frontline'. but you get what you pay for.  I've been told by my vet and pet store managers. on several occasions. that most of the other products out there have been known to cause more siezures and deaths in dogs. as compared to the safer and more effective and proven 'Frontline' product.  My dog had flea issues. and was scratching endlessly for days.  Just a few hours after I applied this product (simple 1 spot application between dog's shoulder blades on back). my dog stopped scratching. and is resting happily.  'Frontline' worked in no time!"
8,"I was not sure if I should order online or just go to the vet. The reviews on amazon were the reason I was more willing to go and just buy it. However. I decided to order them because I knew for what to watch out. and I was aware on how to check if the product is fake by reading the reviews. The Frontline came last Tuesday. and it just happens that it has come a day before I have to apply the formula to the dog. I am happy with the product; I don&#8217;t see any fleas on my dog. I have been buying this product for a year and a half now. so far I have to say that I am really happy with this product.  I will update this post if I see any changes. I am a bit concerned that they might have had change the formula. since a lot of people mention it."
8,"We have used Frontline on our dog her entire life (she just turned 5) and it works great.  We spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks.  This past weekend we were up in North Dakota with her and my Dad and his dog - my dad's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2.  I think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we hadn't found them first."
8,"At first it seemed to be working.  It seemed to get rid of the fleas.  None to be found after a few days. Whoo Hoo!  But then after the first 10 days. they were back.  I thought the eggs must have hatched that were in the house and they too will be gone after they bite the dog... nope.  The fleas seem to be worse now than before.  (not that frontline made them WORSE) But the effectiveness seemed to wear off after about 10 days!  That is a huge cost for just a few days coverage.  :(  I groom. raise dogs and do rescue work.... It cost a small fortune to get frontline for everyone and now seems like it was a waste.  I have doses for one more round... hope it does better this time."
8,"This summer and into the fall. my dogs went through a tick infestation.  I tried several different products. and this one worked the best.  I have 3 small dogs and I actually purchase the largest size tube and use a syringe to measure their dosage. which I found on another web site.  If you use these flea and tick products. you know how expensive it is.So. it works very well killing fleas and ticks and if you find out what your dog's dosage is. you can purchase larger tubes and save a bunch of money."
8,"I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't an oily topical that you have to avoid touching for 2 days until fully absorbed.  I know the flea protection works and can only hope that the tick protection works. too.  I like that it's supposed to repel ticks and lice.There is a new one out called NEXGARD that is oral. but I'm reluctant to try it since it currently only lists one tick type and isn't a repellant. so the tick has to bite the dog before it kills it."
8,"This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and 'Advantage' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
8,"Historically. my family has had great success with frontline. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it because I know it can work (based on the flea population characteristics your dog comes in contact with).We had been using this for 2 months when my dog went to a friends house while we were on vacation. When we got back. he had fleas galore. We put on the next frontline a week early and it did not even phase the fleas on him.We switched to K9 advantix II and the fleas were gone within a couple of days. I know that some fleas are now resistant to Frontline. and that certainly seemed to be the case for the fleas on my dog. I would recommend not buying any more than a 3 month supply at a time in case your dog gets fleas like mine that aren't phased by frontline. If you try Frontline and it doesn't work. k9 advantix II might. as it did for me."
8,"Our dog is an American Eskimo and we live in Miami. Florida. We have exterminated the yard. his bedding and had been using the Preventic Collar.  We also used Rose Geranium oil. all with no success of the tick infestation on our dog.We finally tried Frontline Plus and it has been a couple of weeks now and we are still having the same tick problem.  Adult ticks and baby ticks.  It's not doing a thing to help get rid of the tick problem so far.There are no fleas at all and plenty of ticks on the dog every day."
8,"This fipronil medicine is a breakthrough in pet care.  I researched the medical articles thoroughly to make sure it's safe for my dogs.  The research shows that this is one of the safest medicines on the market.  The fleas are COMPLETELY GONE!  I have never seen a single flea or tick on my dogs after using this product.  The review from the other person about sluggishness in their dog is jumping to conclusions based on a coincidence.  There is nothing in the medical research to indicate that would be a side effect.  There are no side effects other than temporary reddish skin at the site of application and even that was in a rare number of cases (skin can get irritated from just about anything).  The bottom line is that the fleas hate this product. and I love this product!"
8,"Not knowing any better. I treated my 20 lb. rescue. mixed breed with Frontline Plus for several years. I would stop treatment in the cold. winter months thinking I'd give his system a break. Upon resumption of treatment. my little guy had a seizure -- eyes rolled back. involuntary shaking and tremors -- lasting about 30 seconds to a minute. The second time it happened it dawned on me that it must be a reaction to either Frontline or heartworm treatment. I stopped applying Frontline and there have been no seizures that I'm aware of -- and I'm with the dog 24-7. The Frontline was purchased from the vet and I reported the problem to him. He said he'd had other reports of the product causing problems or simply not working. I would advise anyone to Google flea prevention and read about what we're administering to our pets. There are safe alternatives. We don't need to poison our pets for our convenience."
8,"Frontline Plus is the only product I've used until present when we started using a multi-purpose Heart worm topical that includes some tic and flea protection.  Seems one still needs Frontline type protection anyway..Consider getting a syringe and small container (available on web) and splitting larger does Frontline over two or more applications.  I'd not be comfortable using one so large that it took more than two or three months to use it all - and keep the unused portion in a cool/dark place I have been told."
8,"I rescued a cute little dog. Well. after a few days. I found that she had ticks.  I have never had a dog with ticks before so I did not know what to do. I probably did not have problems before as my dogs always had Frontline to keep them flea free. I bought this and immediately started the applications. It took a few weeks but now I rarely find any on her and when I do. most of the time they are dead or almost dead. I feel the product does what it is suppose to do."
8,"Check out the FAQ's on the Frontline website.  Here are a couple of quick tips I've learned that have helped.-Your pet should not be bathed or swim for 24 hours after Frontline is applied.  If it is applied after a bath. be sure your pet is thorougly dry.-The longer you use it the more effective it is. single applications are not nearly as effective.-You can still have a flea problem even after treatment due to the life cycle of a flea and timing of the treatment.  Best thing to do is to continue treatment in the meantime.-Also. you may see increased flea activity after applying Frontline.-Frontline is definitely beneficial for tickborne illnesses.  The tick needs to be attached for 36 hours before the pet can be infected. 36 hours is typically how long it takes for a tick to die after attaching to a pet treated by Frontline."
8,"Frontline worked fine for a while.  But fleas are like viruses.  If everyone in an area uses the same flea treatment then the fleas learn to tolerate it.  This summer a lot of folks around here started complaining the Frontline no longer worked for them.  Unfortunately. it was true of my dog as well.  She is riddled with fleas within the first week after treatment.  If this happens to you I recommend using a cheap Nitenpyram pill.  You can get them on Amazon.  One pill will kill pretty much every flea on your dog. but it only lasts a day. But it will give you time to find another treatment that will work before you house gets overrun.  Lets hope you never get the Super Fleas!"
8,"I have used this for years without a problem. but I believe that they have changed the formula. because it quit working a few months ago when I bought my new batch.  My vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints. and that long time users have switched to other products.  I am now using Advantix which works great. and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes. but there have been some cases where Advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs. so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package.I wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change."
8,"Normally. I love Frontline Plus for my dog. However. I chose to order this from Amazon because the price was cheaper. This frontline did not work at all. Something was wrong with it. I order alot of 'thinks' from Amazon and never had trouble before. I have had dogs all of my life. used frontline plus ever since it came out. and it always worked. I ended up buying Frontline Plus from another reliable place and it works 'great' just like it always did. This was a bad batch."
8,"I sent this product back because it was a KNOCKOFF!  Very subtle. but my vet confirmed it. and we've been going to her for over 5 years so I know she's telling the truth!  I ended up going to 1800PetMeds because they guarantee their products are authentic.  I buy products on Amazon all the time. but for something as important as my dog. there will be no more bargain hunting on Amazon for something like this.  Spend the extra $ to get the authentic product.  Amazon is great for a lot of things. but should put a LOT more focus on protecting its customers!!  Counterfeit products from China. and other Asian countries can be VERY dangerous and if you love your pet like I do--paying more is far cheaper than a vet bill!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"I have purchased this for 4 years for my Scottie Ebony.  I had always obtained them from the Vet.  They work so well and he has never had a single flea or tick that I ever found.  He is more of a house dog but goes outside to his spot to do his business.  But he loved to roll in the grass in our large backyard.  He has never had a case of heartworms and I also give him HeartGard medicine to prevent worms in his heart.  I always have to buy the larger size for him because the smaller size does not have enough to cover him and protect him."
8,"We adopted a stray dog that prefers to be an outside dog.  Living in a rural area. she has free roam of several acres of land and was constantly scratching at fleas.  I had tried products from our Local Feed and Seed but they didn't keep her flee free.  Frontline Plus has been a miracle.  Not only does it keep her from scratching from fleas. it kills the flea cycle.  Fleas still get on her but they don't live long enough to cause a problem.  Amazon's price was considerable LESS than what I would have paid at the Vet's office....PLUS I used my Amazon Chase card and took advantage of my collected 'points' which brought the price down to almost NOTHING."
8,"My dogs have been having seizures on an almost regular monthly basis since they were 4 months old (they are littermates). I only started recently searching about the relationship between Frontline and seizures. and there are SO MANY people whose pets have had seizures from Frontline. Your vet will deny it but there are too many people who have reported it. Sure enough. I realized my dogs were having seizures 1-2 days after each application of the preventative.This product may work well on some dogs. but for mine. the evidence is clear and the Frontline has been causing seizures in my dogs.I'm switching to a gentler. natural brand."
8,"OK. I hate to leave negative feedback. but Frontline just doesn't work. It only works for 7-10 days. and the fleas start coming.I've had my dog for only 6 months. and I started using Frontline Plus right away. As soon as the weather started getting warmer. I started dealing with flea problems. I thought maybe the Frontline I got off of eBay had gone bad or was fraud. I bought some on Amazon. and it was the same. It only works for 10 days max. then the fleas start coming back. Now I got fleas in my apartment and have to deal with chemicals to get rid of them.I took my dog to the vet yesterday and she said a lot of customers are saying the same thing to her. and recommended I change the treatment to another brand.Stay away until they get their act together."
8,"I'm suspicious of the packaging because I've never seen it. and it does not match the picture shown.  The package I received has a different dog on it. and the UPC has been replaced with a sticker with a different UPC on it.  I am returning this because it does not match the packaging at my vet. nor at other pet websites that sell Frontline Plus. approved in the U.S.Update: Surprisingly. Amazon will not allow a return on this item because it's considered hazardous. So with that thought in mind. buyer beware."
8,"We've been giving our dog this medicine for years and its always done a good job of keeping the ticks and other things off of him.  We have found a few dead ticks in his fur. but never a live one and certainly not one head deep into his blood supply.  Applying it isn't so difficult but since our dog is white. it does leave a discoloration in his fur until his next bath.  This is what our vet recommended so we're going with it and it works fine."
8,"I am very pleased with the this product. 3 MONTH Frontline PLUS Orange for Dogs 0-22 lbs I have used it on two dogs and neither ever had one problem with this.  No reactions and best of all. never a flea.  It was recommended to me by my vet and I am pleased with it.  Also note. that if you have cats. there are certain products that you should not use on your dogs since they can be fatal to a cat living in the same household.  This is something not everyone knows. so please check with your vet if you have a mixed household of pets."
8,"I have always used frontline plus on my many dogs but this year. my pom got sick when I used it on her. she couldnt get enough to drink and was panting alot I mean alot she layed around and didnt want to go out with me to walk or even in the yard. and the front of her chest area was ringing wet  from her panting not from the water not satisfied with this product anymore and I've heard of more people complaining that frontline is not the same as it used to be.. I am not using it on my pom because I don't want her sickagain.."
8,"This has 6 applications. where you use this on your dog once every month for 6 months during the summer months.  It helps to kills fleas and ticks that might get on your dog.  No dog should be left outside all day in the summer. because there is a bigger chance of your dog to get fleas and ticks.  Take them for walks. and let them out with you. but don't keep them out in the yard all day.  They need water. and air conditioning is nice!!!!"
8,"I've used Frontline on my dogs (and cats) for years now.  I had once gotten a country dog and no matter what I did. couldn't get rid of the fleas.  Then Frontline came out and I was finally able to get rid of them.I've used this product for at least 10yrs and have never had a problem.  This year was the exception in that we had a warmer than normal winter and a very hot dry summer. so I did have to use some flea spray as well.  but it is under control.ONe other thing.... I was told by the vet that it works best if used all year long.  Might be a tad pricey for that if you have several dogs (and cats) like I do. but if it'll stop the problem before it begins. it'll be worth it.Thank you.MEF"
8,"...this year. after using this product since 1986. I have actually seen fleas on my dogs.  I had heard through the grapevines from other vets and people that the item just is not doing its job.  I don't know if its because our NY winter 'never freezing.' like it usually does. however. I would have to say I have to start looking for a new product.  I am not sure if this is either a quality control issue with the company. all I know is that I've used this product for way over 16 years. without incident.  I don't like K9 Advantiix not for the lack of product control. I just found that my dogs actually get ill when its applied. and lasts at least for 2-3 days.  Not sure what is going on with Frontline. but I'm not happy with Merial ... they need to look into this a little bit more."
8,"I used it for a few years but alas. probably because the fleas acquire resistance. it no longer works. I've switched to Advantix and it does. Of course. I'm concerned. societally. that as with antibiotics. it's an endless battle. I hope we keep developing effective (and safe!) flea controls and antibiotics. but it's hard to remain optimistic that we always will. Of course. the world may well have ended before then--for example. some terrorist scientist creating a highly communicable mutated smallpox virus that he released in a public place."
8,"I have tried both products and for me this one seems to work the best. It keeps fleas away and ticks. I also use this with the Vibrac Preventic Tick collars. Before I started using this and the Preventic Collar. I was always finding ticks on my dogs. 5 and 6 at a time and they would be totally engorged by then. Now. I may find one or 2 baby ones on them. but get them before they can really bite the dogs. because something in this product repels them. so I really am a believer in this. I totally have seen the difference and can't live without it. I stock up on it because it runs out of stock often."
8,"ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time. so beware of that. do not rely on looking for the name of a BAD seller to do more shopping!  2nd. they advertise this product as FRONTLINE PLUS!  BUT WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR AD. the product is FRONTLINE TOP SPOT!....not the same . and it is the reason it is cheap. look it up...frontline top spot does NOT kill flea larvae or eggs. so you only kill the adults. not good and a waste of money!**** HONESTLY IT IS A big GAMBLE TO BYE FRONTLINE ANYMORE HERE. hard to catch the scammer!"
8,"I have used Frontline for years. and in the last 4 or 5.it is different.  It doens't work as well as it once did. and I lost a cat because of it.  She had symptoms of poison.  The vet suggested it might be antifreeze.  I live in the country with no home nearby. and how many actually put antifreeze in their own vehicles nowadays?  My dog had a seizure and it took reading this discussion to figure out it was Frontline all along. poisoning my pets!!  I thought my dog just old. but in retrospect. each time I put it on him he reacted quickly with the seizures and throwing up.  Thanks to everyone posting on Amazon discussions about the dangers of Frontline! I don't want to put even one star on this rating but it makes me before it will post.."
8,"I had stopped using Frontline a few years ago when it 'appeared' to stop being effective on my dogs. It was on sale a couple months ago so I tried it again. I don't what they did but I'd say it improved as I found no sign of ticks (or fleas) on the pets. We are heavy with them here in Maine in the fall and so far the Frontline is doing what it suppose to. As long as it does that and doesn't have an adverse effect (which can happen) on our pets we'll continue to use it.."
8,"I have a stray cat who comes in to the bathroom off my garage every night.  I got him used to doing this because I was afraid of all the predators in my area.  He is perfectly happy there. and I sleep better knowing that he is safe.  I have been giving him frontline every month. and every night when he comes in I pick ticks off of him.  I am returning the frontline I purchased at the vet because I don't have money to waste.  I have heard that the ticks are become immune to this stuff.  I will never use it again!!!"
8,"My mom's beloved Bichon Frise is the family pet.  The grandchildren all love her and we'd be lost without her.  Unfortunately. she is highly allergic to flea bites.  She also cannot tolerate a flea collar.  We have tried everything for this poor. sensitive dog and finally found Frontline Plus!  We apply it every 45 days because she's mainly an indoor dog and only goes out for using the bathroom.  The vet suggested every 45 days because of her sensitivities.  It works wonders!  We just started using it May of this year (2008) and she has not had a single reaction to fleas for the first time in the 10 years she's been alive.Every dog should have Frontline Plus applied to keep them flea free!  We no longer have to put her on allergy medication.  It's been such a wonderful product for her."
8,"In all honesty. I'd rather not use this type of chemical product on my dogs.  I resisted for as long as I could but the so-called natural products were. sadly. ineffective.  I was pulling off a tick a day from them and I found a few of the little suckers crawling on me.  That was the last straw. so enter Frontline.  Bottom line. it works better than anything else I've tried. There's nothing more to say about it. except if someone knows about an effective natural/less chemically product. please let me know."
8,"I have used Frontline Plus on all my dogs for years. It works great on my toy poodle and bichon; who are indoor 22/7.Now for my other dog a pitbull mix.. he gets ticks 3 weeks after I put in the application. I thought the ticks were suppose to die when they bit the dogs skin. but these ticks don't die! they feed on his blood :.( it gets bad. He stays outside 16 hours a day. I dont know why front line doesn't work with him. It works great with my other dogs."
8,"My box was definitely genuine because I bought it at Costco. Did NOT get rid of adult fleas and the infestation is as bad or worse as ever. I have to find something that works because my pets are miserable and the house has fleas now too. Too bad these medications are all becoming useless. They used to work so well. Does anyone know which one actually works nowadays. All these meds are way too expensive to fool around with duds. I need something that works and is safe for my dog."
8,"I've been using Frontline for years with my dogs. It has always been very effective. which is important living in a place with lots of ticks. After going on nature walks. it's nice to check the dogs and not find a single tick on them.  If only the same could be said for us humans :-).When I moved to VA. our new vet had us try another flea and tick product. One of my dogs had such a horrible reaction to it. Racing heart. panting. hyperactivity. that the vet had to give him a sedative. Needless to say. I'm sticking with Frontline. It does the job and my dogs tolerate it well.I always purchase this product through Amazon because you can't beat the price! I also make a point of choosing the 3 month supply boxes because the order is filled by Amazon. This is important to me because I know that I can count on a speedy delivery and that I receive the product I ordered."
8,"It's so much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores and it really works. It takes a while for it to absorb- so you have to be careful not to touch your pet where you applied it- but once it is absorbed there is no odor or anything.  I took my dog to a nearby park. When we got back to the car I noticed he was literally crawling with ticks- but when I went to pull them off I saw that they were all as dead as a  door nail- it didn't take even half an hour for the Frontline to kill them all. I'm wondering if something that toxic can be good for your pet. but if you have to use something it may as well be a product that works."
8,"I love frontline plus. My dog isn't exposed to fleas and ticks that often anyways. He is just a 14lb cock-a-poo. But he does play with the cat a lot and k9 advantix II explicitly states that their product is toxic to cats (the dog formula is). I had to return it immediately and have been using this ever since. My dog isn't a run through the fields and woods kind of dog. however I am sure that there are fleas out in the yard or on other dogs when he goes to dog daycare. He has never had flea problems and I have been using this for about 8 months now."
8,"We use Frontline Plus for flea control because it works. We started with Advantage when our Golden was younger. and that worked well. too... but our dog likes to swim and Frontline is waterproof so we switched. She is 8 yrs old now and has never had a flea - which is amazing since we live in S.CA. near the beach where fleas abound and visit parks all the time. You are supposed to put on monthly... I end up putting on every other month and in winter every 2-3 months... seems to work fine with those intervals. Frontline isn't cheap - but Amazon has best price... Our Costco started carrying it for the same price. but no tax and free shipping gave Amazon the edge."
8,"I live in Maine so needless to say it can be a bit buggy in the non-winter months. even in open spaces. I have been using Frontline Plus for my Great Pyrenees mix for years and have never seen a flea or tick on him- even after a day of romping through the woods and mud. He's also never had any adverse reactions to the product. I also like that I don't have to worry too much about my cats being around him when it's been freshly applied. Some other brands advise against cats being around dogs recently treated with their product. Not that my dog and cats cuddle but it's one less thing to worry about."
8,"I have used Frontline on my dog for years. but this is the first time that I purchase Frontline Plus.  I cannot be certain that our problem is a direct result of the Frontline Plus. but my dog developed a growth and open wound at the place where this is applied.  I have contacted the company and they were very kind and made a report for their research.  However. the dog required medical attention and antibiotics.  Just wanted people to be aware to keep an eye on the application site just in case it was a direct result of this product."
8,"We have used Frontline Plus for several years on our dogs and never had an issue.  Never seen a single flea or tick on them.  I have a lab who loves to dig and roll around in the grass and sand. and I haven't had any problems.  Last year we decided to try the new generic equivalent to save a few bucks since we are buying for 2 dogs.  BIG mistake.  We pulled off several ticks.  As soon as we could. we went right back to FP and haven't looked back.  It is worth the little extra money (there is not THAT huge of a difference in price) to be sure our dogs are safe from fleas. ticks and all the other nasties out there."
8,"This product seemed to work for a couple of weeks at controlling fleas on our indoor dog who only goes out for exercise and to potty.  However one morning while combing her I noticed something stuck to her skin and much to my surprise it was a tick!  I thought it was very strange that the tick would be on her and still be alive considering that Frontline specifically states that it is for controlling both fleas and ticks.  Moving forward another month and it happened again - another tick.  This time I decided that this product just does not stand up to it's guarantee. nor does it work as advertised.  I will not buy again.Have since switched products. and have not experienced the same issue again."
8,"I bought a Great Dane puppy who ended up having mange all over his head. I applied frontline and within a day the mange started clearing up. Within one week from the original application the mange was gone. I applied the frontline in between his should blades (not on his head).Another one of my Great Danes I had purchased was covered in ticks (literally hundreds) when I brought him home from the breeder. I used frontline on him as well and within one day the ticks were falling off. He had ticks all over his head. paws. belly. back. everywhere...and after applying frontline that evening. I could see the ticks falling off of him by the next morning.Frontline has worked well on all of my dogs and I have used it for many years."
8,"I have been using Frontline Plus on my 19 pound Scottish Terrier for 24 months.  On three occassions she has developed a flea problem in between application times.  The most recent being last week.  Her flea application was Nov 7. 2010 and not due again until Dec 7. 2010.  However. after developing a flea problem last week. I had to bathe her and put on a new application Nov 22.  I am becoming more skeptical that this product works as it is advertised.  I do live in Southern California where fleas are almost a year round problem due to persons not cleaning up after their dogs."
8,"Ok So I have used this product for the past two months and it is not working. I don't know why. it appears to be in the exact same box as the one you would get from your local vet. I know it says it takes at most 18 hours to take affect. Well It has been 10 days since my last application and I just had 3 F****** fleas jump off my little chihuahua and onto me. I am not happy about this at all. I only paid about $20 less than what I would have paid at the vets office. WHAT'S THE DEAL????Is this S*** fake ?????????????????I don't usually do reviews if the product is good. but when it is bad I do because I don't want anyone else wasting their money!!!JUST GO TO YOUR VET TO GET THIS. For some unknown reason this just isn't working and I am frustrated."
8,"I've tried some of the major competing brands in an effort to save a few bucks. but Frontline continues to provide the best results for fighting fleas (on my three beagles and two cats).Last year. Frontline helped eliminate a flea infestation on my cats. when used in conjunction with other flea control solutions throughout my house. This year. we adopted three beagle puppies that were covered with fleas when we got them. Used Frontline again. at the recommendation of our vet. and the fleas were wiped out before they had a chance to re-infest our home.Continuing to use Frontline now to maintain our &#34;flealessness&#34;. I don't think Frontline Plus is perfect (It's expensive and doesn't seem to always last a full month). but for my pets. it's the best available and none of them display any adverse reactions to it."
8,"I have been using this on my dog since he was a puppy at the instruction of my vet.  It seems to work reasonably well as he has never had any problem with fleas or ticks that I could see.  The product is easy to apply although the packages are sometimes a little bit difficult to open.  It also seems to cause my dog's skin to itch slightly as he will always start rubbing his back against the carpet when I put it on each month.  Generally. it seems to be doing its job. however.  If you buy it in a pet store like PetSmart it is sometimes $20 more than it is here on Amazon."
8,"When frontline first came out it was strong enough that 1 dose would last on one of my dogs for over two months. it's not that strong anymore it seems.  It does however. work really well.  I want to use it specifically because it kills fleas as eggs and adults.  It will help with ticks but they are very hard to get rid of.  I get this size pkg and divide it up between my 8 dogs who range in size from 22lbs to 90 lbs. My vet gave me a syringe to get the liquid out of each of the vials and advised me on the correct dose for each dog.  It really saves money!"
8,"I use Frontline Plus every month on my 25 pound mutt and so far it has worked perfectly. She has had no flea. tick. or lice infestations whatsoever. In fact. I've witnessed ticks jumping on to her and then jumping or falling off soon after without attempting to burrow beneath her fur. The chemicals in Frontline Plus are absorbed into the dog's skin and are very effective. I don't like to think about how they might be harming the dog....she seems not to notice the monthly application or the slight chemical smell."
8,"Many of my friends say Frontline does not work against fleas or ticks in their area any more. so have switched to other flea/tick control brands.  Well. it still works for my dogs. though we really don't have many fleas where we live in the desert.  I mostly used it when we lived in an area where ticks were prevalent.  I use it on the dogs only about every 3-4 months. just in case. as I do attend dog shows. and don't want to bring any visitors home with me...  Be aware that studies show that Frontline can be detected on humans' hands weeks after applying to the dogs...so wash after petting. ( Advantage showed transfer to humans for even longer periods of time. and that is imidacloprid. so would never use that product.  )"
8,"I'm training a puppy and he LOVES this.  I got the liver flavor.  My only complaint is that it doesn't last long. so it's a pricey &#34;treat&#34;.  It fills the kong toys well - put through the smaller bottom hole and use the toy to bend the nozzle and it fills up the toy nicely w/o mess.  It's cheapest on Amazon (from what I've seen so far).  But my pup has this polished off in no time at all. so it's only a short break while he's busy with the kong... I'll only use this for special rewards in the future"
8,"All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched 'tasty pastes' available through Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before. we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the 'pasty Kongs' for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kongs' 'tasty pastes' - it's easy to use. doesn't seem to make a mess. and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it '2 paws up'!"
8,"My dog loves this! I squirt in in or on her toys when she's done something to deserve at treat. She wiggles her whole body when she sees the can. It's easy to use. and the &#34;wand&#34; at the top is long enough that you can put it slightly inside a Kong so that the dog can spend some time licking it out. I like to put this inside a Kong and then chill it in the freezer for several house. I live in Texas. so my dog loves this when it's really hot (all summer)."
8,"I bought this because it's a tad more affordable than Natural Balance's food roll.  I cut this roll up into bite size pieces and use it as a positive food reward when training my dogs.  Much to my suprise. both my cats LOVE this stuff as well so I crumble a bit of it into their food and they gobble it right down.  My eldercat is thin and I have a hard time keeping weight on her. and she will just about do back flips for this stuff.  Came as a huge shock to me because she only likes sweet. creamy treats like cream and yogurt.  Anyway. 4 lbs cut into cubes will last you a pretty long time. and when fed as treats won't cause your animal to have gastric upset.. atleast not mine.  2 thumbs up!"
8,"Previously I had fed our Lhasa other brands of food rolls in different flavors but after trying Redbarn Food Rolls. our four-legged companion voted her favorite flavor as Redbarn Beef.  I alternate morning and evening food between the food roll and kibbles. The 4-pound food rolls are so easy to store in the fridge and for long-term in the freezer.  I slice a whole roll into 1-inch slices and then halve them before dividing into two containers - one container for every day and one container in the freezer for future use.  I stick with the Zukes Mini Treats (all flavors) for bribes and training treats.  The food roll is boxed with bubble packing and arrived within a day or two after I placed my order."
8,"I first bought the Redbarn Food Rolls to supplement the &#34;weight maintenance&#34; dry food I was feeding my 2 miniature poodles.  The dry food had been recommended by the breeder.  The dogs LOVE both the Redbarn Beef and Chicken & Liver rolls!  I found too. that the ingredients actually surpassed the nutrition supplied by the dry food and contained less calories than the dry food.  I still use the Redbarn as a supplement. giving each dog one half of a 1/4&#34; slice morning and again at night.  They each first devour their share of this product and will later go back to finish the dry food."
8,"this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues. it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein. like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food. despite having some unbeknownst to me. chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken). but if it weren't for that. this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house. including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol. I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back. hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free."
8,"My 3 Maine Coon cat (huge cats!) would die without this particular blend of Wellness if it disappeared.  It is their less healthy treat. but still much more healthy than any of those old school branded canned foods at Walmart/Target/the Grocery Store (including Hills and Science Diet).Look up how to feed an obligate carnivore and how to calculate the actual dry matter protein matter of a food and its importance compared to these indigestible unnecessary fattening carbs.  Cats are not dogs.  The have never evolved to eat our scraps. and therefore they can't use things like corn. wheat. or even the fruits/sweet potatoes/potatoes.  This has the more healthy fillers (no corn or wheat) and a much more competitive dry-matter protein content compared to most brands.  Also. there is cranberry which will definitely help your older cat's bladder/UT system."
8,"My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping. because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged."
8,"Love this product!!! My old dog has been taking this human grade form of Cosamin DS for years and it's kept his joints limber.  It's cheaper to buy the human grade than it is the pet grade for him.  I like this seller and as long as the prices stay reasonable I'll stick with ordering from them.  I also give him Earth Animals holistic : &#34;Aches/Pains drops directly into his mouth 2 x a day to ward off any pain from old age. (don't give your pets drugs that will destroy their organ's)  He's doing great!  Hope this helps someone else."
8,"Our German Shepherd. Gabby. is so energetic when we give her these. which is every morning. She does prefer the roasted beef Zuke's better. but loves these. also. The vim and vigor that she gets from these are unbelievable and she is very peppy after consuming the recommended amount. I think highly of this product and believe that the ingredients make a huge difference in the well being of our pup! She is happier. springier. and does not act like an old lady. like she used to! Awesome stuff!!"
8,"My dog absolutely loves these treats and I really feel they have helped her! She has a congenital hip problem and now arthritis has set in. She has a very pronounced limp after laying down for awhile. but since she's been eating these treats. we've noticed a difference in her not limping nearly as bad. I was going to purchase another bag this past week. but the price jumped up over $3.00 per bag in the short time since I purchased them the first time. I ended up looking at more treats with glucosamine in them and bought something else that seemed to be a better price & she at least likes them. I really wish the price hadn't jumped up so much because I would have bought more. but the difference was too much for me!!"
8,"My dog loves these treats. I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages. no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products."
8,"My 15 year-old 80# mixed-breed dog had slowed down noticeably. I followed the directions on the package but didn't see much difference after 2 weeks. At the end of the third week of feeding these treats once a day Herbie started running again. At the end of the month. he is romping and playing with my other dog like he is a puppy. I just watched him take the stairs 2 steps at a time. It seems like these treats took longer to work but once they kicked in my arthritic old dog now thinks he is a strapping young man."
8,"Very healthy treats for a 7 yr. old 93 lbs Doberman. He loves working for these treats. butbecause they smell so good. he pays more attention to the treats than to the commands I givehim. So he'll do two or three commands at the same time. hoping that's the one I want himto do so he gets his treat faster :-)My dog has no problems with his joints. but as he gets older. I hope to prevent that by givinghim the right food and treats. He has some catching up to do for the first two years of his life.when he was abused. At age two. he only weighed 39 lbs when he was rescued. I have hadhim for five years now and have spoiled him rotten. But it's nice to know I can do that in a healthy way!"
8,"We have tried different supplements for our 11 year old Golden Retriever but he kept having a hard time getting up. After about a week on these he is getting up a lot easier. we see a huge difference. Granted. he's not getting up as quick as our 2 year old but we absolutely see a difference. I highly recommend this to anyone!Update 12/3/2013:We upped him to 5 treats a day and WOW. he is getting up a lot faster and is even walking faster. He weighs about 100 lbs and 5 seems to be the correct amount for him. If you feel like there is no benefit for your dog try upping it for a few days and see if there is a difference."
8,"I have a senior maltese who is prone to knee problems.  He began experiencing pain in his legs when jumping on and off the couch so I decided to get these for him to help with his joints.  I give him one each day and I have not seen him limp or yelp in pain ever since I started giving these to him. which has been over a year.  The best part is. he loves the taste of them. and when I open up the baggie. he gets super excited and starts wagging his tail and licking his lips!  I knocked off one star b/c I have noticed that some bags are not as fresh as others (no I haven't tasted the product myself but the fresher products are softer and the older ones are harder)."
8,"I use Zuke's Hip Action treats on my 15 year old miniature schnauzer. I noticed last year she was having trouble getting up the stairs. These were recommended by a coworker (I work in a popular pet store chain) over expensive pills. Now she jumps and walks normally again. her joints aren't as sore. She loves these treats and gobbles them up. even though she's very picky. The price here is also a great value. I bought them at $10.99 a pound. the store I work at is $9.99 for half a pound. so this is a great deal!The only con to it is that there are no preservatives so they go dry/stale very quickly. so make sure to dose daily. They're a better deal than most supplement pills out on the market and a lot easier to feed to dogs. Highly recommended."
8,"My two mini-dachshunds love these treats. They're made of quality ingredients. with meat listed first. and are produced in the USA. I like that they contain supplements for joint health since dachshunds are prone to spine and joint problems. The pieces are too big for my little dogs. but they're soft and chewy so I can easily tear them apart. I've had the same bag for about a month now since my dogs don't get treats every day. and the treats are still nice and soft. not stale at all. These treats would probably be great for older dogs with dental problems. too. since they're so chewy."
8,"Our 14-year-old was starting to get stiff in his hips.  We tried a supplement on prescription. from the vet first.  That really helped. but the 'treats' were like little hockey pucks. with the consistency of jujubes.  The dog didn't like them.  These treats have the same active ingredients. so we gave them a try. They are great!  Our dog loves the taste and he really looks at them like treats and not like something he'd rather hide under the rug.  We matched the dose up to what was prescribed and he's doing just fine.  These are also less expensive.  The only problem is keeping them away from the puppy. who also thinks they are delish.  It's awesome that these are available on Subscribe and Save!  Of course. like all Zuke's treats. they are made in the US and the ingredients are actually food products and not by-products.  We have never used a Zuke's treat that was bad."
8,"Car insurance rates are astronomical in my city. so I gave up my car and rent one when I need to do shopping. errands. appts. etc.Run out of healthy dog treats?  NEVER!!!  I order them from Amazon  -- one of their trusted merchants makes sure my Lulu has what she needs. on time.  OR. I could spend $30 in gas for my rental car going to the burbs to pick up what I gotta have!  Lulu thanks you and I thank you. Amazon."
8,"We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement. Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat. corn. soy. by-products. or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine. but I've taken it for years with wonderful results. and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course. I'll be ordering another."
8,"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique. and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use. I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However. when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget. she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly. Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit. Angel. because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby. surely it would also work for Angel."
8,"That was before they sold out to Nestle Purina.  We all know what happens to companies who sell out to mega corps - the quality suffers. they start out saying everything will remain in house under watchful eyes - that never happens. Already Nestle Purina has brought in their own management team. The ingredients will probably start becoming imported from china! The very reason Zukes came in to existence was has a quality option for pet parents who don't want to buy into the mega corp crap. Zukes will NEVER be welcome into my house again. Ever. Nestle Purina - makers of Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch - that crap killed hundreds of dogs starting in 2010 when Nestle Purina bought that company. NEVER. Again."
8,"I have 3 spoiled dogs.  Puperoni was the only pricey soft treat they'd eat.  Then I tried beef Zukes as something cheaper and different.  They smell awful to me. but the dogs all grabbed these little squares and gobbled them up....to my surprise.  I then bought the Chicken Zuke's. which they rejected.  So It's back to the beef recipe.  Since all my dogs are older. I figured that the extra benifit of 'hip action' would be a good thing"
8,"Supplements are difficult to evaluate since they don't work instantly like drugs and their effects are often subtle but I have been taking two of these a day for at least 6 months and it has not helped my knee pain.  I'm sure the ingredients may be good for me in other ways - I have read that this is true - but since the problem for which it was recommended by the health food store owner in my area was knee pain and it has not made a dent in that. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and award it three stars - the three stars are for the good effects it may be having that I haven't noticed."
8,"I initially bought this item to help with the minor pain I get daily from inflammation.  However. I find it works ok for the inflammation. not as good as I had hoped. but by surprise it certainly helps with my night sweats and hot flashes.  They have decreased immensely and I don't feel so uncomfortable when I'm shopping and break out into a great sweat.  Not sure which item in this does the trick. but I'm one happy camper.  I sleep better too!  Give it a try. it's not a bad price either."
8,"The ingredients are pure. and a great synergy of the top herbal treatments. They're a bit smaller than most liquid pills. You can smell and taste them. but I enjoy that since they're partly robust culinary herbs (however. I also enjoy traditional chinese medicinal herbs most of the time). I can't directly attribute positive results to them with total certainty. But I do feel better. I haven't caught the widespread colds. even at home. And my back pain has relaxed significantly (although I've also been doing physical therapy. so I can't say which is having more of the positive effects). Given how clear it is now that systemic inflammation is largely responsible for so many common ailments. I believe what the company says that this should be deemed as requisite as daily multi's."
8,"Since I have only used one bottle and it takes 2-3 bottles to achieve full effectiveness. I can only rate it 4 stars. Overall. I feel that it works as it says it does. I have noticed I take a lot less ibuprofen for joint pain. In fact. in the last two week. I haven't taken any. I have a chronic shoulder injury that I just re-injured at work this past Friday. I didn't need to take anything for the pain. I just took the Zyflamend as directed and a hot bath. The shoulder feels okay. I can tell it is healing. I will definitely be purchasing another bottle. I have shopped around for pricing and it is sold elsewhere online for almost half price. Be sure to do your homework before purchasing for the best deal."
8,"i was having a lot of trouble with my hip this summer and my chiro suggested i try this in addition to taking it a little more easy in the gym.  i was happy to try it since i was popping ibuprofen like pez.  it wasn't immediate. but. the pain has pretty much subsided. i'm finally running again and the only pain i feel are in the muscles that are still tight around the side of my hip. i am making sure to gently stretch and foam roll to reduce tension and soreness."
8,"I am a runner and every day exerciser. I liked the idea of the Zyflamend and when it was offered to me through the Vine program I jumped to get it. Well. I have been taking it for just about a week now. and I can tell you that I have not derived any benefit from this with the exception of some really bad stomach and intestinal troubles. I am not sure what is causing it. From looking at the ingredients. it looks like a lot of the stuff I already have in my spice cabinet (oregano?). but there is something in here which does not agree with my digestive system. So. after a week of taking it. I am done. Thought I would develop a tolerance. but it never happened no matter what I did (eating or not eating before or after taking it didn't make a difference either). Maybe it's just me. so I am rating it a two star instead of a one star."
8,"I've been using more and more of the New Chapter products because I've found them to be high-quality and effective.  This one is no exception.  The only downside is that you really. really have to make sure you eat first before taking this.  A lot of supplements say to take them with a meal. but mostly you can get by without taking them with a meal (at least I can).  However. if you take Zyflamend without eating -- and I recommend eating first. not just popping your pill at the same time you eat -- you will likely end up with a burning upset stomach.  It's an effective product. though.  So as long as you remember to eat first. I'd say try it and see how it works for you."
8,"My mom suffers some age-related joint pain. and I had her try this herbal remedy.  It seemed to help. and just as significantly didn't seem to cause any side-effects or gastro issues for her (she's normally very sensitive to many medications).With this sort of remedy. it's hard to separate actual effects from the placebo effect. or from combinations of other hard-to-quantify variable such as the weather. activity levels. diet. etc. but it seems like it may help. and it doesn't hurt."
8,"I've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend.  My blood pressure is back to normal and it's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis.  My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time...2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed.  After having trouble sleeping for several years he's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom.  I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly.  I have a sensitive stomach and I'm having no problems taking this at all now.  I do take it with food.  I highly recommend this product."
8,"I have a 7 year old Maltese. and a nine month old miniature schnauzer. The size of these treats was fine for them. and after some initial reluctance at the unusual flavors (pizza and cheese. with chicken and beef being the normal flavors) the dogs seemed to like them. However. the day after I began feeding them Scooby Snacks the Maltese began throwing up. and the Schnauzer had alarming. unnaturally colored diarrhea. It did not immediately occur to me that it might be the treats. but the next day when the symptoms continued I stopped feeding them treats altogether and all upset ceased. Nobody else seems to have had this problem. perhaps I simply got a bad batch. but I am not willing to try these again."
8,"These are perfect for stuffing toys. like kongs and other types with smaller holes.I put round and square ones into my Aussie's large regularly shaped kong. and the biscuit-looking ones into my rat terrier's stuffable chew toys. She doesn't get the regularly shaped kong. because her jaw is smaller than the kong's opening. so she fishes the cookies out very easily. She gets other toys (from Petsmart) which are very tough as well. but have smaller openings. like KONG Stuff-A-Ball. It takes her over 20 minutes to get them out.  These cookies are much harder than regular biscuits. It takes her 5 minutes to get the regular biscuits and snaps out of any toy.my rat terrier is a very powerful chewer..."
8,"I have a miniature dachshund that is addicted to table food. Normaly I leave dry food available at all times and 1 bowl of wet food a day. He has always been a picky eater. basically just wanted human food. Recently he would take a bite or 2 of his dry food and barely touch his wet. So we decided to switch dog food. and ended up choosing this. He LOVES this stuff. I can't leave dry down anymore because he gobbles it up before it hits bowl! Also we buy the containers on Beneful wet food. he loves that as well!Another thing that I love about this food is it makes his coat shiny and soft. Not sure how but ever since he started eating this he has had softer and shinier coat."
8,"This was a better price than at the big box store. and it came straight to my door. That's a double bonus! I really appreciate the easy-to-open tops on these; start in the middle. and peel the tape off - easy as can be. My pooch loves. loves. loves beneful dog food. I think it's because there are moist bits as well as crunch bits. but whatever the reason. she literally foams at the mouth when she eats it. The flavor I purchased was Playful Life. but there are quite a few different kinds and sizes. My dog also likes the Fiesta and the Original."
8,"I've used Pet Tab vitamins in the past. but have recently been disappointed to find that many of them are produced in India or outside the U.S.  Vetri-Science products seem to be of good quality and reasonably priced. so I thought I'd try these when I ran out of my Pet Tabs.  Unfortunately. the dogs don't seem to care for them.  My older dog spits them out even with peanut butter on them.  Once my puppy finishes these. I'll not re-purchase since they don't readily eat them."
8,"I haven't noticed a difference in my dogs' appearance or health since taking these for several months. My vet thinks dog vitamins are only good for &#34;making expensive dog urine.&#34; I still give these to my dogs but I don't think I will reorder. I improved the quality of my dogs' food and started giving them coconut oil supplements and will probably just stick with that.NOTE: When these arrived. my dogs did break into the container and eat about 80 vitamins between the two of them. They vomited and had diarrhea for 24 hours and ultimately cost me $800 in vet bills... they are fine now and actually had no side effects after the stuff left their systems. but just a warning to keep these out of reach and watch out for potentially toxic iron levels if they're binged on."
8,"I adopted Sam from a local shelter.  He had a dull. brittle coat. constant rash and other health issues.  I had him allergy tested and found he was allergic to some 40 foods and environmental allergens.  The allergy testing places compiled a list of dog foods he could eat.  All were expensive ($60+ for a 30lb bag) and hard to find where I live in rural Alaska.  But we love our dogs up here and I found that I could get Avoderm on Amazon for a hair over $40 for a 30lb bag with free shipping.  I haven't made my postman happy. but my dog loves it and I love the price and ease.  Sam can't have potatoes. peas. and a lot of grains. so Avoderm has really changed his life and mine.  Thanks Amazon!"
8,"I feel fortunate to have looked on Amazon for our regular dog food. and have been getting it here ever since.  You can't beat the home delivery AND saving at least $10 with every bag (I have Prime so I don't have the added shipping cost).  My dogs are a rat terrier and a JR terrier.  Ages 8 and 12 respectively.  They have been eating this food for years and are in perfect health.  I do give them human food too.....turkey. pasta. meat loaf. carrots. apples....mac n cheese...they get a small portion of whatever we are eating about once a day. but their main diet is this AvoDerm."
8,"My dog was eating a high end food with a high price tag and it just wasn't working out!  My wallet was thinning but my dog became extremely miserable.My dog just moped around and had no energy and was becoming a real grump and very moody. I foolishly thought he was just getting older but that obviously wasn't it.I picked up a bag of this food at my local supermarket and my dog Beau's life came rushing back! He has his energy back. he enjoys eating his food. plays and initiates play just like he used to. and his hair is super soft.My dog is a Maltese which is a toy breed. so I have to break the pieces in half with my fingers. Sort of a pain. might try little bits with beef by Smartblend next time.I would have liked to have purchased it here at Amazon but they only sold it in a small bag. But I researched the product here before I bought it elsewhere."
8,"If my dogs like like the taste of Purina One and they eat it. then there is not more that I can say except I trust Purina products. I am always looking out for the best products at a reasonable price and through the years Purina products have provided food that is healthy and balanced. at a reasonable price. and most importantly. my animals like the taste. Most of our dogs and cats live to their teen years. with two of our cats living to 19 and 20 years old. this I think I it in part due to Purina products."
8,"My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However. since Purina developed the smart-blend. she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes. change isn't better."
8,"My cat just gobbles this food up! We were feeding my cat Scamp Fancy Feast dry cat food that he loved until the last bag. That food changed in shape. color and odor. It became offensive to me and the cat went on a hunger strike. So I had to do something and fast.My dog loves his Purina Smartblend dog food so I decided to switch my cat to their cat food. And I am so glad that I made the switch. The smell is not offensive. I like the tan and brown pieces in two different shapes.It has only been a little over a week since Scamp has been eating this new food and when he was at the Vet today. I was told what a luxurious coat my tabby cat has."
8,"My cats love this and even my older 17 yr old cat which passed in 2012 was spunkier after eating this for a few weeks.  When I could see the difference. I knew there was something to this.  They eat the tuna and salmon flavor.  One bowl of this along with one of the flat cans of moist Friskies food split between each cat is what was the guaged right amount for my two cats per day.  They nibble on the dry cat food throughout the day. and look forward to the fresh moist food each morning and by the evening. it's gone.  Any more is too much; less will render lots of complaints with loud meows before the evening's done."
8,"My cats love this food...and the price is right.( usually a bit cheaper than any store) If you'll read the ingredients. the FIRST ingredient is not chicken meal or some by product. it's real chicken!! The cats love it. and it's very nutritious. We took this bag to our Veterinarian and showed him what our cats were eating...he was pleased and said go ahead and feed them this..and he had tons of food in his office he could've tried to sell us for our one cat's sensitive tummy.  He said this food is great!!  We won't feed them anything else!"
8,"My cats. all under 10 months old. all love this food.I mix it up. dry. with a Science Diet kibble. one to one. and they eat every last crumb in the bowl. They commonly don't pick up pieces from the floor. but I won't hold that against them. I do not mix this with water. so it never gets soggy. The bowls are often completely empty in the morning. This is in addition to the canned cat food I give to all 6 cats. They eat their fill of the called. and even leave some behind. if it is not up to their standards. but they never leave any of this dried food behind.My cat's love it."
8,"My cats loved this. They had energy. their coats looked shiny and had less dander. Compared to Blue Buffalo. this is better and less expensive. But it is still quite pricey so I switched to Purina Friskies which is garbage. because I had to save some money this month. I did some research and the Purina One formula looks pretty good. I would say it is between the Friskies and the Beyond. The first ingredient is real meat. I looked up what 'corn gluten meal' is in the regular Purina One (not Beyond) it is a decent/inexpensive source of protein. It isn't actual gluten at all. it is the second ingredient on the list. I am going to try the Purina One next. And if there are coupons for this one I will get this one. It is really good. I would recommend. especially over Blue Buffalo and Wellness. in my humble opinion."
8,"I would usually be taken aback at buying a Purina cat food. as I've become something of a nutrition nazi when it comes to feeding my cats.  Typically. I'm a big believer in Natural Balance. Blue. and Wellness.  Having said that. one of my cats is allergic to fish. and finding dry food that doesn't have fish is quite a task (canned food without fish is conversely. very easy to find).  Trim that list even further by finding a sans-fish dry food that my cats will actually EAT.  Found this food by Purina (I suppose One BEYOND is one step above just &#34;One&#34;). which doesn't contain any fish. and (amazingly for Purina) doesn't have any significant grains/carbs.  The final hurdle?  My cats just damn love it.  I won't say it's the most nutritious option out there. but sometimes the nutrition vs. cat taste appeal has to be balanced out."
9,"I bought the purple one to add to my Strong Man Set of 6 to make it a Super Strong Man Set of 7. This is one tough band. Great for high intensity bicep curls and door anchor exercises. such as back rows and standing chest press. But too difficult for tricep kick backs. It came with a door anchor and an instruction pamphlet. There's no BMP logo on either handle just like their orange band. Overall I'm glad Black Mountain is going the direction of making their systems better and stronger. Keep up the good work."
9,"I absolutely love these resistance bands! You have every amount of resistance you could need. and bands can be easily added together to get your perfect resistance. The handles are comfortable. and the door anchor does stay in the door. I was a little scared to try the door anchor because I was afraid it was going to come flying out and hit me in the face. but I tested it using a long broom lol. I do love using resistance bands instead of weights because you get lean muscle instead of bulky muscle like from free weights. This is a great set. and I highly recommend them."
9,"This was a great surprise for the money.  I looked at resistance band workouts on YouTube and decided to try it out. At this price why not?  I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try.  The door anchor worked great.  I'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible.  This I just keep in my night stand and any time I've got some extra minutes I do a little workout.  Pleasantly surprised and pleased.  I highly recommend."
9,"This is a pretty decent set of resistance bands. The only thing I would change about it. is that the band themselves are a little bit long. When you put the attachments on them. they are too long to do some of the exercises I would like to do. I have tried to tie the bands in knots to remedy this. but they are very hard to untie. so I try to avoid doing that. Also. if you call the company after you get your package. they will send you a free orange band. which is even stronger than the strongest band in this pack. That was a nice little bonus!"
9,"Good for those small exercises that one can't do with freeweights. I use it for slight rehab on a knee. It's perfect for that. With the door stoppers you can get angles that really help (if you have old joints). Of course it's all very light. so I can't see doing anything heavy (for those looking for something to supplement freeweights. such as wrapping around barbells when doing squats and so forth) with these. but they're good so far and seem to be made to last."
9,"Bought this for my wife as a tool to use to do mild exercises while she is going through chemotherapy.  She is 5&#8217;6&#8221; and has a hard time. no; she can&#8217;t use the cables for most of the exercises because the cables are too long. She has to double over the cables so the length is not too long.  This would be fine if there was a second door and ankle attachment. but there is not! She does use one cable at a time and does find the construction very good.  The variety of band resistances are nice as well as the exercise instruction book."
9,"I have had these for about a week now... and i am afraid to use it at full potential...why?well from the first minute i took it out of the bag. i could tell it is made of cheap material...it just did not feel sturdy or durable enough to handle any demanding exercise or tension... the rubber bands look like they can snap if you push them... and if that happens it could be very dangerous as it might hit you and cause you injury...i will continue to use and update this review....but regardless of whether anything happens or not...this is not a product i would buy again as it doesn't feel firm or sturdy enough for the kind of tension workouts it is intended for..."
9,"I bought these resistance bands to use along with P90x. and so far they are holding up well. It's been about 2 weeks since I've started using them and none of the bands have broken yet (as some reviewers have mentioned). I don't yet know how they will hold up in the long run. but I'm not too concerned about them since Black Mountain Products has a great warranty on them.They come with 1 set of grips that attach to each of the bands via a metal clasp. If there isn't a weight that you like in each of the bands. you can combine multiple bands and customize the weight yourself.I really like these. and assuming they hold up - I give it 4 stars."
9,"I am about half way through the P90X workout and have been using these straps.  So far they have held up well.  Clipping straps onto and off of the handles is quick and easy. so I can move from less to more (or more to less) resistance without hassle.  There is a short guide which tells you the relative resistance of each color band. so you can add up or subtract down to the resistance you want.  While I am sure there are better bands out there. I am also sure you would pay more for them.  This is a good product at a reasonable price."
9,"These bands are some of the most well constructed I have seen.  They also have clips on the ends which allows them to be used in tandem. so the red. black. green. blue. and yellow can all be used together for extra resistance. which is a major plus for athletes who need more resistance.  The door anchor included is a very simple design. but it works well.  All of the bands also have a lifetime warranty. just call them and they will ship you a new one (you have to pay shipping though).  The handles are well constructed. and the wrap around handle is pretty standard universal gym type stuff.  Will buy from this company again."
9,"This is a nice assortment of workout bands--the first I've purchased or used.  They connect to the handles quite easily and I love the bag that stores everything nicely.  The single most important item in the kit is the paper that tells you what strength the bands are!  It would have been nice if they included a laminated card with this information. but it's really no big deal.  I am at a lower strength band am anticipating working my way up to the stronger ones eventually.  NOTE:  I have not used the ankle strap or the door anchor. just the handles."
9,"I primarily use these attached to the door. I am emulating pull ups. trying to gain strength. I use them all at once. figure if I do 10 or so a day it will help to gain strength in those muscles. I have a different set I use for workouts. Only because of the handles. they are great when you want to use several different bands together to increase the resistance. but for a workout you want to be able to grab something quick. not have to to stop and put the handle on the right band. Great product and it does come with the door attachment."
9,"I currently use these bands for my P90x!Pros:You can use multiple bands as they clip onto the grip.Included ankle strapIncluded door strap (for pull ups/etc) **this saved me from having to put a hook into the stud of my wallComes with a nice carry bagCons:They dont tell you that you could also get a FREE ORANGE BAND!!! with FREE SHIPPING! lol...I called them up because there was a little paper inside and he said just leave your feedback. anonymous or not &#34;we dont check it&#34; and call us back. we would be glad to send you an orange band free of shipping. We do this for about 10% of our kits.Why complain? Right?...Keep up the good work!-Mike ReedDallas.TX"
9,"I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set based on the positive reviews I've read here on the product and the customer service. Fortunately I have not had to use the customer service. But the product is as advertised. I wanted to hold off on writing the review until I got to use the bands for a little while. I have been using it for my P90X workouts along with dumbbells and it has performed flawlessly. The quality of the bands are excellent and when you think about the cost it is a real bargain. Rarely does a product exceed my expectations but this one has. I highly recommend these bands."
9,"These bands are great.  The only room for improvement would be better carabiners/clips.  The carabiner like things have sticky springs and have sharp edges which could potentially cut through the bands.  It is nice to be able to attach the bands to other things and I have used a bit of rope to tie them off to poles and trees.  Use a bowline around the tree and a linemans loop to secure an additional carabiner to.  This set comes with an exercise guide.  These bands are good when paired with the BMP exercise ball because you can focus on muscle groups.  Isolate the hips for those ab exercises!  Have fun. mix it up!"
9,"This is really an excellent accessory to improved dumbbell training at Home. or you can even bring then to the gym.The power hooks provides the user with a method to perform and accomplish heavier dumbbell training procedures safer and easier. resulting in maximum training benefits from your pair of dumbbells. reducing the risk of injury when handling heavy weights.Each power hook comes with a leather strap that attaches the power hook to the dumbbell bar. This way for example you can position your loaded dumbbells in the overhead barbell. lay in the bench. and grab the dumbbells that are already positioned in a convenient way to perform presses or flies without the risk of injuring yourself when to try to take the heavy dumbbells from the flour to the starting position for a dumbbell bench press or fly.I bought mines about six months ago. and I love them. They allow me to handle heavy weights safely when there no one near to help you with the weights. This is even more convenient if you train alone at home."
9,"This was a hit at a 4yr old birthday party.  The perfect size for a few kids and adults and super sturdy; we had some future s/he-mans yanking on the handles with all their might.  Play some music and do freeze dance. have the kids try to all run under before it goes down. are they fast enough?  Other fun games - through some ball on top and don't let them bounce off.  There are probably many more ideas out there if you search the world wide web of fun.  Now I am waiting for another turn where we have enough people over to use it."
9,"I bought this toy for my almost 2 and 3 year old boys. as well as for a gift for a girls' 3rd b-day. I admit that it's not as easy or as fun to use unless you have at least 3 people holding the chute. It will be a big hit at any party. playgroup. or get together. All ages are drawn to playing with a parachute and all have a blast. It also fosters group creativity and dynamic play; turn taking. cooperation. and collective participation. I love the bright colors that just add to the fun and festivity of play. Get outside and have a blast!"
9,"This parachute is a lot of fun!  Kids come up with all kinds of uses for it. but our favorite game is to put the baby underneath the parachute in the middle and just pull it up and down.  He gets a kick out of it and the older kids love to see his reaction.This one is bigger than I thought it would be. which is a good thing. but unfortunately we actually don't have enough people to play with it when my husband is not home.  If each person holds onto 2 handles it can fit about 5-6 people around.  But if you have only 3 people to play with. while it still works. it's more fun with more people.  But I guess that's the way all games/toys should be!Definitely recommend this for outdoor (or indoor with a lot of room) activities with lots of kids!"
9,"My friend has this for her son. and her new puppy fell in love with it. so I thought I might try it for my new girl. So. I bought this for my 10 week old puppy - she just loves it. It took her a minute to get used to it. but now she'll go out of her way to run through it. So far its held up quite nicely to puppy chewing. running etc. What I really love is that is sooo easy to fold up. I can put it away in a minute and when she's ready to play I can just pop it open. So much fun - plus its big enough that she'll be able to play with it long into her growing stages. Very fun toy! Not sure if kids of the human variety enjoy it as much as the furry ones. but I recommend it if you have a playful puppy!"
9,"The main benefit of this putting mat is the ball return. which works well and is very convenient (definitely helps keep visiting kids entertained!).  The downside is the green fabric putting mat itself. it is difficult to smooth out which means each time we roll it up to store it. the next time we bring it out we have to smooth it out all over again which is an annoyance.  Also. the overall cheap look to the background and the stickers over the hazards.  Everything but the ball return is cheap. so the $40 price tag is a little steep. I think I'd view it more favorably at $30."
9,"This set is good for the office - and if you have carpet. it would help if you attach some velcro at the ends to make the mat straight. Otherwise the mat is my biggest complaint - it does not straighten out enough. The return mechanism is pretty good. the unit itself feels fairly cheap. My 7 and 10 year olds enjoy it. even set some obstacles to make the course more interesting.As far as using it in the office. I had a few bosses who like to &#34;practice&#34; at the office. and this would be a winner for a birthday gift."
9,"My daughter is qualified to play in the Junior Golf World Championship and she uses putting greens like this to practice at home.  I have 5 different models of these electric return putting greens and in my observation. it seems like they are all very similar in quality and construction.  The speed on all of them are a little slow. and the plastic is a little cheap and thin. But they do work as far as getting  some practice on the tempo and direction of your putt.  For the price it is being sold. it is a good deal.  Please do not try to compare this to the quality of putting greens 5 times its price.  If you want to get one that is an excellent and accurate analog of a real green. expect to pay that much more.I have the professional type of putting which I had ordered and it cost me $230 for almost the same dimension as this. and it did not come with an electric ball return."
9,"This is a putting mat with a ball return which is very similar to any putting mat I've ever used. It has a length of 'green' which is basically a fuzzy piece of fabric. a slope at the end. 3 features including a ball return. I've seen many of these putting mats and the inexpensive ones are all pretty much the same price and similar features. I suspect this one costs more because of the ball return feature. Others which don't have a return and is simply a piece of green fabric with holes would cost less. At the other end of the spectrum you can buy ones costing thousands of dollars. But I digress. For this price. this is not a bad putting mat. It's got a nice 9ft green. 3 features and the return."
9,"I have to laugh at this one. The cheesy picture behind the hole. the fake &#34;traps&#34;. the generally terrible build quality...it's so lame it is in fact kind of funny. But for 40 bucks the joke's on you if you buy it.At least it does return the ball. For that it gets an extra star.I'd give this four stars at 15. and five at 10. But all of these astroturf-y putting matts are basically the same. so look on craigslist and find one for five bucks. there's always lots around. Or buy one here for far less than this. Or just use a glass on its side on the rug. But OMG. then you have to take a couple steps and get the ball yourself!One tip: put tiny little tea bags etc under the matt at various places for a more realistic roll. makes it more fun too."
9,"The issue I have with the CLUB CHAMP PUTT N' HAZZARD (sic) putting green is that every aspect of it feels cheaply made and likely to fall apart quickly. The back &#34;3D&#34; wrap-around uses Velcro and doesn't fit properly. It leaves gaps between the base and the wrap no matter how much I fiddled with it. The putting surface isn't bad at all. but needs a little ironing to lay flat. The ball return works well enough. The plastic cup. &#34;sand trap&#34; and &#34;water hazard&#34; are made of very thin plastic. Not durable at all. If you use this at your office. it will probably hold up. But if you have little kids like me. they'll destroy this thing pronto.Overall this putting green feels cheaply made. I'd look elsewhere."
9,"One of the two best multi-tools on the market today. (the other being the Leatherman SuperTool 200)PROS:1) Strong pliers with comfortable grip2) All blades can open while pliers are closed and all blades lock3) Useful Chisel blade4) Anti-rust finish5) Heavy Duty steelCONS:1) The file on the 'X' model seems to be made of aluminum. After some use the 'steel' plating chipped off. The Leatherman file is much tougher and can be used on wood or metal.2) You might break your nails trying to open the blades.*UPDATE*>> I sold sold the 'X' model and purchased the 'RS' model thereby trading the cheap file for a curved serrated blade. I like this tool much better now."
9,"I have owned a few swisstools and this was a bit of a disappointment. Half of the tools do not lock solidly in place with &#34;up and down&#34; play. The Sheath I received was defective. The button will not even close. I have written Victorinox to see if they will replace it. I assume they will.Just as reference they have changed the swisstool slightly this year. There is no red label on the tool anymore as shown in the picture. The full serrated blade is also a Sheepsfoot shape now and not as shown in the picture.This tool is still better in quality than most leathermans in my opinion. Leatherman is hit or miss on the Quality Control in my experience. This is the first Swisstool I have ever owned that I was even slightly disappointing with. Don't let the 3 stars fool you."
9,"In my humble opinion. the best supertool around. and I own probably two dozen of them that I've collected over the years. The tool exhibits a fit and finish better than anything else out there. and one great feature is that the tools fold out from the outside of the handle. It featured a positive locking mechanism when most of the other tools still had yet to offer it. including the famous Leatherman. Even with all the innovative multitools of recent years with each new one trying to outdo the other. this took remains head and shoulders above the rest. Next to this. as with a previous reviewer. I would rate the Leatherman Supertool as best."
9,"I have carried one of these on my belt for over 25 years and recently left mine on the tailgate of my pickup and drove off without thinking. I lasted three days bare of my Victorinox and couldn't go any longer. The price is a little spendy but trust me you won't even give it a second thought after you use this tool for a month. It is extremely well made. engineered to near perfection and handier than the zipper on you pants. I don't go 24 hours that I don't use this tool at least a half dozen times. It has it all and then some. The steel in the blades is exquisite. The knife blades hold their edges well and the file and saw actually work andstay sharp. I am forever using the leather punch to start a screw in hard wood or punching one of my cigars for a smooth draw. Spend the extra bucks and get the real deal tool of your lifetime."
9,"I own several brands of multitools but Victorinox continues to top my list for its funtionality. smooth deployment. craftsmanship. and durability. Although Leatherman is a far second. I put my trust more in the Victorinox. I have one that Ive owned since 1983 and to this day. its main blade is sharp enough to slice paper floating down in air. Premium grade carbon stainless steel used in making Japanese swords! The wood saw in it also cuts through lead pipes. Put it this way. if I were lost in the thick jungles of South America. I would choose to have the SwissTool (rather than any Leatherman and Gerber) stuck to my belt. Maybe that's why MacGuyver favors Victorinox."
9,"I was given this tool some 11 years ago by my wife on the day she announced i was to be a Father. she gave it to me in a box with my daughters name on it to me... Im a Director Of Engineering at a property. been in this industry for over 25 years. I own more tools than my garage can hold. but i will say this once you feel this tool in your hand and feel the weight and quality and design. youll agree that its WELL made and very well crafted. I have tried Gerbers. and Lethermen but they never hold up for me. This tool is NEVER away from me. I use it and this is no joke. but I use this tool at least 5 times a day. I plan to retire this one real soon due to the '' value '' of it to me personally and Im getting the exact same one again. If I can get over 11 years use out of any tool its a hell of a deal..."
9,"I love this tool. Yes it is heavy. Yes you can wear it on your belt and no one will notice. Really. And yes. you get a great amount of tools. I already always carry a Swiss Army Knife on me. so I went with this model to get the serrated blade. and not the scissors.It is perfectly aligned. buttery smooth. nicer than my Leatherman Rebar. and yes. bigger and heavier. The tools come out on the outside. and lock with a satisfying &#34;snick.&#34; The release is easier to use than the Leatherman Rebar. Which itself is a nice tool. I carry that in my daily work messenger bag.The pliers are strong and super easy. One nice touch -- the ruler. inches/centimeters. is far easier to read than the Leatherman. The result I think of the brightly polished steel."
9,"First trip. I filled 2/3 of this cooler with ice then lay it on its side on a roof rack.  A day later. I got it off the top of the car and although some ice had melted. I was amazed that nothing leaked from the lid.  Filled the cooler up with water at that point and 2 days later. still had a little bit of ice.Second trip. filled about 1/3 with ice and water to about 3/4 full.  Next day. most of the ice was gone even though outside temps were about the same as trip #1.So now I know not to skimp on ice (I already don't like drinking water so if I have to it better be ice cold) but I'm impressed the lid holds so securely.  The spout is easy to operate with one hand and our 5-year old has no problems with it.  Handles feel sturdy and are comfortable enough to carry a full jug with just one."
9,"I was thinking of buying a pool float to use as my camping mat and I found a great deal.  $10 for an air mattress SOLD!  Luckily for me I have an air pump with me when i go canoe camping because my canoe is inflatable.  If I didn't i would Not get this. as it is VERY hard to inflate.  Because I have a foot pump it takes me 5-10 minutes to pump this up and for $10 it works for me.If you have a pump then this will do for your camping or pool needs.  If you don't then I would not get it as it is VERY hard to inflate.Others said its also hard to deflate. i found if you cut/puncture the inner seal and just let it deflate on its own its fine."
9,"I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress. but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together. but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches. and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve. but it's a small price to pay for light weight. portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat. I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all. neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak. but for the comfort. it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in..."
9,"This float was purchased to be a 'floating cover' as required by central Texas laws in regards to having 25% of your pool covered.  This float does not stay in the pool on even mildly windy days so I do not recommend it for that purpose.  Additionally I got the orange one which faded within the first week and now after a few more weeks looks absolutely pitiful.I have to put air into it every couple of weeks too.The kids do enjoy this one a lot because it allows their body's to dip into the water while relaxing on it."
9,"I had this set as a kid and loved it.  Once I had children old enough. I wanted to purchase a set for them to play with.  I am so glad I did.  It has been a blast teaching them how to curve the ball and how to throw in general.  We can play for hours.  They are great for park outings with your family or with any group you may belong to.  We take them to our scout picnics and this is always a hit.  We have 3 sets so there are plenty to go around.  It does take a little bit of practice to get used to it. but once you have it you are in for a great time.  Just be patient and take the time to try it out before you get frustrated.  If you have a family get this.  It is so nice to have stuff like this to do rather than be stuck inside with the electronics that do not allow for interaction.HAVE FUN!!!"
9,"I bought this item for my 5 year old nephew as a Christmas present. The setup of the net was relatively easy. I would recommend using a partner just for the sheer size of the rebounder. The only semi-difficult part was stretching the rebounder net to attach it to the frame. This took some strength which was not a problem for me. but I could see some smaller people having issues with it(I am not bragging or a chauvinist. just saying I am a big man and have more strength than most).  My nephew loves this item and it appears that it will last a long time. I am very please with this item and would definitely recommend it to everyone."
9,"I cannot recommend this grill/griddle enough. since it is so versatile and easy to use and clean.  It makes a whole breakfast from bacon and eggs and pancakes. Flip it over and it is an excellent grill for meats and fish.  And it works well on gas and charcoal cook surfaces as well as electric.  I has a gas stove and am always in awe whenever I use it since it makes cooking so much fun.  And the price is excellent.  I have scads of cast iron from this grill/griddle. to fry pans of all sizes. and cornbread pans and other items.  Stuff never wears out and gets handed down generation to generation."
9,"For pancakes. this iron griddle heats slowly and evenly. and it holds the heat better than a teflon griddle but...you...must...season this and instruct well-meaning helpers NOT. repeat. NOT to use any soap of any kind. sponge. steel wool pad. on the griddle. Ever. If you are worried about cleaning it. you can scrub the surface with a hot. clean water. handful of cooking salt and a clean paper towel. After seasoning. pancakes cook evenly and this is wide enough to go over two burners and really get some production going at breakfast. Just remember about the seasoning and the No-Soap."
9,"I have been a photographer for over 45 years and am very familiar with the quality of Nikon's optics. However. I own both the Nikon 10x25 and the Bushnell 12x25 binoculars and in terms of clarity I find no discernible difference between the two. except the Bushnell has a bit more power. The Bushnell's are also much smaller than the Nikon so they take up less space when you are packing for a trip. Considering they cost $30 less than Nikon's. and are stronger. the choice is clear...buy the Bushnell every time. A great pair of small binoculars."
9,"This must be more ideal for a handgun.  The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15. Remington 12 gauge. nor my Reuger .22.  The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger. however. when I tried that. I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun.  The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved.  I should have returned it. but I was lazy."
9,"I've had one of these in use for nearly a dozen years and it is a solidly constructed. reliable locking device for use on the trigger guard of even a very large frame revolver. I always recommend putting firearms in a safe or locked gun cabinet (secured to a wall. floor. or both). but these kind of trigger locks added to unloaded firearms are an excellent backup. and keep unauthorized fingers away from triggers.Rim-fire guns. and a lot of vintage center-fire guns are best never dry-fired. Using a trigger lock can help prevent accidental damage by people who just don't know better. Of all of the different types of trigger and action locks I've employed. this one is the most ruggedly constructed and durable model I've owned."
9,"Wow. for the price I was expecting total crap.I was really surprised by how heavy duty this thing is. and how well made the keys are. When this thing is on you're gonna have a pretty tough time getting it off if you don't have a key.One thing I'll note though (and this is not related to this product) but a design flaw with these is that if you attach one you're not 100% in the clear as it literally takes 1 minute to unscrew the trigger guard from most guns re-exposing the trigger. This is definitely the case for my Remington 700 as anyone who actually wants to shoot the gun but doesn't have the key can just unscrew the hinged floor plate assembly and reattach a new one without this thing on it. That's why I also got one of those long locks that goes through the action."
9,"this lock is useless on my glock and shotgun and only barely fits very awkwardly on my sig sauer.  it does fit on my ruger revolver but barely too.  it is bulky and you're better off getting a small lock box instead of this.  it may sound good until you try in on and it doesn't fit or barely fit. not to mention it may scratch up the gun.  this claims to fit many or most guns but it doesnt fit the popular ones out there like the ones i have.  what's worse is that the 3rd digit on the combo gets stuck and is difficult to move.  that would totally render this lock totally useless.  it doens't fit and if it does fit it would take you forever just to roll the digits over to your code to unlock it!  overrated lock."
9,"I liked this better than a keyed lock because you can literally grab it and run! No need to try and look for a tiny key. In an emergency you want to be able to get to it fast and this way anyone can unlock it- only if they have the combination.I bought a 6pack and my buddy and I split them. Now we both have our guns locked and safe.I let me brother use my gun a little while ago- he called and asked what the code was and I told him... THAT EASY! good thing there was a code and not a key because I had forgot to tell him initially. Would have sucked to go out to the range and not have a key!No lost key or anything- this is a great purchase and I would recommend it over a cable or keyed trigger lock any day!"
9,"Strong. reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock. involving complex curves in three dimensions. of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun. but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with."
9,"For people who haven't seen one of these: it's pretty darn awesome. The picture makes it look plastic. but this is solid metal. Sturdy. Heavy. I put this on my Mossberg and even though it won't fit behind the trigger. it still locks on there tight. Adjusting it to my own combo was difficult because the last dial was difficult to turn when I was putting in the new combo. With a little persistence. I was able to get the right number.NOTES ON GUN SAFETY: Better to pay $10 now for this product than thousands in court fees (or worse) down the road."
9,"I had one for my XD and now have a few more items I wish to keep SAFE from others using.  Not only a great price they are awesome to use and easy to change the codes for locking/unlocking.  I had lost the directions form my years ago one and nor have the easy instructions to change the codes.  Insert a pin into the opening and change the codes. how easier can it be. I could of had a V8 moment when I saw this....Silly me for forgetting..."
9,"my only issue is that you can't put this lock on and put it in a gun case smaller than 3 inches high.  There is a 1 inch nub in the back of the lock.  I use this in place of the cable lock which I hate using because you have to keep the action open and the slide springs are compressed.  If someone sits for a couple days straight. they can probably figure out your combo with only 3 numbers. but it's better than nothing and you don't have to worry about losing a key."
9,"fits almost all my firearms in one way or another (from one side or the other). easy to set combos great quality good solid feel and fit. much safer then keys that can be lost. i keep some of my firearms at my mothers house and now she can feel safe and still have access to them when needed. i have them on almost all my firearms. not cheap but nothing thats worth buying is. buy more then one and the shipping is worth it as the shipping is a flat rate for anything from one item to 100."
9,"Solidly made and easy to use.  The process for picking a combo is straight forward and it will fit on everything from my .22 pistol to my 12 GA shotgun.  The tumblers are smooth and feel solid in the housing for the price you can't beat this little lock to keep any unwanted hands off your trigger.  I take mine out when we go to the range to keep kids and moron's from shotting each other while I'm shooting or working with another shooter and don't have eyes on my weapons.  Plus with the combo you don't have to worry about forgetting/not finding keys when you need them."
9,"This lock gets harder and harder to find in stores.  I remember picking up one from Cabela's last year. and ended up loving it so much I went back to buy a few more; they were gone.  I made a few trips back and forth a a few other stores in the area over the next few months and all I could find was the keyed version of this lock.  Went to Amazon. and there it was for the same price and ordered a few more.  I highly recommend these. but also hope you use your own personal judgment as far as gun safety and security.  I am not really good at keeping up with extra keys. so I opted for these as it would allow me to unlock them in the event that I ever lost the keys.  For home security. I have a weapon that is more readily accessible to me. and I use these locks on guns that I store away."
9,"I bought several of these because I'd moved onto base housing. That required me to either have a trigger lock or a locked case to transport a weapon on and off base. These were cheap. they are easy to set the combo and they are solid. A trigger lock is just that. its not offer the speed of the quick release lock boxes or the safety of an actual safe. But they do add a degree of safety by locking the movement of the trigger on most weapons. Keep in mind there are weapons this will not work well on like lever action rifles. ARs with folding trigger guards and the like. As mentioned I went with these because Master Lock makes good locks and because I could set the combo to what I wanted. That means all the combos can be set to something easy to remember and changed later if I wish. The price is very good and there is nothing I can really complain about. A good product that works well if it fits your need."
9,"This is a simple secure lock with no keys to lose.  The combination is easy to set so you can set them all the same.Fits the  rifles and hand guns I have tried to use it on.It is a great deal better than the cable locks provided with many weapons.Not sure how well hardened the shaft is. only three digits so this will not stop a determined thief that has already taken your fire arm.  But that is not the purpose of a trigger lock.  It will deter children and mothers in law.Please be safe and use multiple layers of protection when storing and transporting your fire arms.In summary. I plan to buy more of these."
9,"I purchased two locks to provide an additional level of security on both a full size rifle and a Ruger 10/22.  I selected the Master Lock combination model because it will allow me to keep firearms secured without having to keep track of a key.  For those gun owners who want to balance the always-never dilemma (always have ready access but never allow unauthorized users access). this product works extremely well.  Despite customer complaints about setting the locks. I the process to be extraordinarily easy.  I had both locks reset and on their respective rifles in just a couple minutes.I will continue to use these locks for any firearm which is not already secured in a suitably locked hard-case."
9,"This was purchased for my S&W; M&P; .40 handgun. It can take a little bit to get it on JUST RIGHT. but once you find that perfect position. it's gold. Numbers aren't the smoothest. but it does what it is intended to do. Like I said. just take a little bit of time to set it up.Overall. I'm pleased with the extra level of safety I now have when transporting it in the car. and you just can't beat the price and fast shipping!"
9,"This as easy to install and change the combination on. It's not a viable  alternative to a gun safe but it's no where near a gun safe price either. It will keep small kids from being able to fire your weapon or anyone else who just want's to pick it up and look at it safely. But. of course. a determined adult could break it with a hammer. It serves it's purpose. just know what your purpose is. I like mine because it does what it is meant to do very well. I view it as a good quality &#34;safety device&#34; rather than a &#34;security device&#34; although it provides some security as well.  Since I don't have kids at home anymore. it's al I need for my wife and I. Even our grandkids are teenagers or adults now.  If I need max security I would use a max security gun safe. But still. this is a good trigger lock to have."
9,"I have just ordered three more of these locks. I already have one and I am very happy with it. I am especially happy with the fact that I do not need to carry keys to unlock my firearms. The keyed locks are sturdy and reliable; however. all it took was one occasion when I forgot to bring the key and could not shoot.Not only are these locks more convenient. they fit my Yugo M57 Tokarev! I have several different pistols/revolvers and so far these locks fit every one.Though I am very pleased with these locks. I rated them a four-star. I did this because it would be nice if these locks were available in a multipack. Paying about 9 dollars a shot for them is a bit much..."
9,"I don't have a gun safe. but needed something to keep my rifles secure in case little curious hands found them. NOTE: my ammo is locked away in a fireproof safe so I've got that covered.  This combo lock seems to have done the trick.  The lock is on nice and tight which prevents unintended use. I tried pulling the trigger but the lock will not budge one bit. I chose this over the keyed version because I have enough keys to worry about. I'm using this on my Marlin 795 and even my Crossman 1377 carbine.  Yep. I'm not taking any chances with a little one in the house and the combo lock fits the bill."
9,"The lock combination can be set by the user.  I bought 6 of them. and set the combination the same on all of them to make it easy for me to remember (I only have to remember one combination. and I do not have to worry about loosing any keys).  This is an excellent feature.I also like that it fits on my shotguns. pistols. and rifles.  You can not see it in the picture. but when you separate the two sides of the lock. there are pressure pins that catch the trigger mechanism to ensure a tight and secure closure on the trigger.  Very good design at a great price."
9,"Works great on firearms with a fixed trigger guard.However. on my two lever-action rifles. it's not very effective -- probably no surprise. given the design. On an older Winchester 94. I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together. with some effort. On a Winchester 9422. it attaches itself to the trigger guard. and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used. The rifle can be loaded. cocked. and fired with the lock still in place."
9,"While trigger locks are not intended to make a gun safe (you can still place a round in the chanber of most firearms). They can act and serve as a deterrent to the use of the firearm.  The lock easily attaches to the trigger guard of all firearms.  It is only effective on firearms with fixed trigger guards. I prefer a combination lock because it eliminates the need for keeping a keyring with multiple keys.  I keep and store each of my firearms with one of these combination locks."
9,"These pads are all rubber and roughly 1/8th inch thick. They are easy to carry inside the original box. The white color gives maximum visibility which helps when placing on grass or on a dirt field. Because it's real thin. it's better to flatten / trim tall grass to avoid bending too much.All in all it's a serviceable set of pads when playing in a park or patch of grass. But for more serious games I think it's better to look for base with more height to the pad. like real bases."
9,"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park.  t-ball. baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store. haul. carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!"
9,"I love this line. I generally buy 8-10 pounds and it is strong enough for any fishing I am doing. I generally bass fish in 20 ft of water.For night fishing I use the line that shows on black light. For day fishing I use the crystal line.I caught a 5 lb smallmouth on Dale Hollow with the 8 pound line. Last year using another line we broke off on several fish. This year I took my own gear and used the Crystal 8 lb line. and had no fear of the line breaking and that confidence was wonderful.This line casts extemelly well. Just remeber this is one strong line. Some buy 20 pound line or higher and that is a huge mistake as the line does not cast as well and is way too powerful for normal bass fishing.With 8-10 pound line when you get hung you are pretty much hung as the line is so strong.I will forever use this line and not waste time trying any other line."
9,"I haven't used theBerkley Fireline 125-Yard Fishing Linein the 6/2-Pound Smoke for fishing yet. but it is the best for beading projects. particularly those with faceted beads like crystals or stones.  I double the line and first wipe it through a paper towel. then run it through beeswax after threading my needle.  I never knot this superline when beading. but use silk or nylon thread in those cases.  Amazon sells this product for much less than any other source I've found.  I also can recommend theBerkley Hot Line Cutterwhich does an outstanding job of cutting and melting the fireline when a project is completed."
9,"I've been using Fireline in my beading projects for about eight years. and it works great for when you're using Swarovski crystals or beads that have sharp edges.The 6-pound count is nice for beads that are heavier and projects that have more weight to them.You just need to be really careful not to knot your projects; quite a few beading instructors have been warning that knots will break with this. and I've seen it happen when they demonstrate it.The smoke color will leave a grey residue on your fingers. but I rub it through a piece of Kleenex to take it off before I wax my thread. and have no problems.I was so happy to find this on Amazon since it's much cheaper to buy it here than from a beading store or beading website!"
9,"If it's 20lb test. SAY that it's 20lb test.  Don't do the '20/8lb' nonsense.  It means it's 20lb test with the same diameter as 'normal' 8lb test monofiliment.  What's up with that?  When did fishing become a techno-weenie adventure?Not at all what I wanted.I'm dropping the staars for a very confusing product description.  I can't use it on my reels. and can't rate it as a fishing line. but the guy I gave it to was very happy to get it for salmon fishing."
9,"Simple review; I LOVE IT! Believe me. I looked all over the internet. looked at all those Youtube reviews etc etc. This is what I found and what I purchased. It 's the best!. Buy it. no hassle. easy to use. comes in a handy bag with all the goodies. The steady view (IS) is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It 's like a digital camera that you focus."
9,"Another poster mentioned only a 1 year warranty but the box (purchased on Amazon) has a sticker that says 3 years and the warranty card in the box confirmed it. I've been using a good pair of zoom binoculars for watching boats and they are fine if I have a tripod. This Canon Image Stabilization (IS) 10x30 solves the problem beautifully. They are far more useful than standard binoculars because you can concentrate on the details of whatever you're watching without straining to hold them steady. They are very comfortable to hold as they are compact and light weight. Everybody who tries them breaks into a big smile when they press the IS button!"
9,"Canon makes the best stuff and now these are my favorite Binoculars. They work GREAT! I always see a lot of unsteadiness when I hold a pair of Binoculars for any period of time while zooming in as far as possible. These though have a button on them which engages a gyroscope (That's what the documentation says) of some sort and totally steadied the image. I walked around using them and they work GREAT! I have yet to try them aboard and boat of from a moving land vehicle. but as the Documentation also states there are apt to be problems with that sort of use. I totally recommend these as being Fantastic Binoculars. Canon always seems to cos more than other devices. I also own a few of their Cameras and Lenses. but you get what you pay for. I have come to like Canon products very much and plan on using their products in the future."
9,"Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job. but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the 'Made in China' stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said. the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own. fit for his small hands. he is so very happy. As I write this review. he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him."
9,"Our three year old has one of these. It is by far his favorite riding toy. He must have spent 50 hours riding it in the past year. It is very well built with strong materials. Other than a little wear it looks like new. It has been kept outside under the patio cover about 1/2 the time and the other 1/2 in the garage.He parked it behind our boat trailer a couple of weeks ago and I backed the trailer and bent the rear wheel. I was able to easily order a new wheel from Radio Flyer and had it fixed in a few minutes after the wheel arrived.Great product."
9,"We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down. he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger. he was able to ride more successfully. but I would say still not comfortably. Also. getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.Pro:- Solidly built- Looks great!- Fairly easy to assembleCon:- Hard for my son to get on and off- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike. IMO- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands- HEAVY!"
9,"This is the best knife I ever had.I wasn't certain spending so much on a pocket knife would be worth it but it was.It is solid and large. It flicks open easily and locks up firmly.  The blade stays sharp.  It continues to work like and look like new.  You can easily operate it with one hand while you hold what you are cutting in the other.The sharpened tip proves very useful for opening packages.  The serrated part of the blade is good for cutting plastic ties."
9,"I own several other SOG knives. This is the largest I have. It should be noted that the smaller knives have the fast spring 'flip out' operation. This model is not the fast spring loaded type like some of the others. But the blade and the way this is designed still makes it fast with one hand. It is a quality looking knife.As usual with all SOG knives. the steel holds a very sharp edge and is strong. The handle has a good feel to the grip and everything about it is quality.I love the lifetime warranty and am sure I won't need it. If I should need it however. it's nice to know this is a company that stands behind their products. This is a more 'handsome' looking knife than the majority of their black coated blades. but they are all handsome and I have yet to have one fail on me or come up short in any manner."
9,"Double bladed. my only gripe is the blade's a tad short. Most manufacturers of great knives don't want to go through the trouble sharpening both edges. but SOG. The characteristics of this knife make it a good fighting knife. but a little on the smallish side. Take a look at the Cold Steel Voyager with a 5- or 6-inch blade for not a whole lot more money. Chances are you'll drop this one in a heartbeat.Free shipping on knives would be great. too. but too many of these outfits want $7 or $8 to send you a $45 knife! I keep hoping free shipping will become the wave of the future in Internet sales. At least on smaller items."
9,"I originally purchased this knife as a backup or emergency use knife but it has been an EDC knife for about a month now and performed extremely well.  The steel holds its edge very well and out of the box I only touched it up with a leather strap to polish the edge a little.  I have yet to perform harsh tasks or try to abuse it but the steel eats everything I throw at it.  In comparison the Cold Steel Hold Out III started to dull after opening 15-20 envelopes where as the Pentagon Elite didn't start to loose its edge until 45 envelopes and breaking down three boxes.  The edge only lost its super fine edge and it only took a few minutes on a leather strap to get it back.The steel used in this knife has me sold and I will never purchase a knife with anything less AUS8 is terrible compared to this."
9,"The action is smooth and one handed. the blade is razor sharp.  The blade is rock solid when in extended position. no wobble.  The pocket clip is rock solid. unlike other knives I have owned.  I literally shaved my leg with it. no razor burn!!!  Now I walk around with a bald spot on my leg.  I also own the big brother of this knife. the pentagon elite II. they are the best folding knives I've ever owned.  I would recommend them with enthusiasm."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
9,"I bought this knife a while back and have used it for a few years now.  It is one of my blades that tasted my flesh.  I cut myself opening a back of Gatorade.  This knife has done some carving. fishing. gutting. food prepping. etc.  It is a neat little folder I use at home and outdoors.  The only recommendation I'd make would be to have the sheath velcro be replaced with a button.  Then I would feel better about carrying the knife on my belt.  Just saying if Gerber is listening.  This blade design just works.  Never slips when wet.  And I love how it just feels in my hands."
9,"My wife uses this as her camping 'kitchen' knife.  She. however. doesn't like to carry it. finding it too heavy for wearing in her hiking shorts.  It does not have a pocket clip. but comes with a belt sheath.  This should have been my first warning it was too heavy for her pocket.  Oh well. still a great addition to our gear.The unserrated blade is easy to sharpen and holds an edge well and the locking mechanism is strong and positive. The grip truly is 'all weather' as claimed. It has an excellent texture. which combined with its rubbery construction gives one a great grip even when wet."
9,"I'm not sure what is meant in the description listed for this knife with the word 'box' at the end. but the box it came in was cardboard.nothing unusual.However. this knife is a good quality knife for the money and the grip is perfect for those occasions where your hands may be wet and you need to cut through something tough using the serrated part of the knife blade.  Your hand will NOT slip on this 'gator' grip!  The overal demensions are great. about 1/8 inch longer than a similar Gerber straight edged knife I have from Gerber (but it has a different handle).  I am very satisfied with the 3 Gerber knives I've bought thusfar. including THIS kinife. the smaller straight-edged (e.g. non-serrated) one I already had before this purchase. and the Gerber Prodigy (survival) knife I bought recently."
9,"I love the way the knive feels and its durability is great.  As others pointed out. it's not perfect like fancier brands.  I bought mine in the late 1990's.  I worked as an EMT and needed a durbale knive to cut seatbelts and for other rescue purposes.I'm not a hunter. but I have taken this outdoors for hikes and fishing.  This is my second Gerber product.  I own the original multi-tool - Gerber's version of the Leatherman.  That got a lot of use.Bottom line: A great value to have in your collection."
9,"I've had this for a week now so I can't speak to its longevity but it seems like an excellent knife. It's light enough for everyday carry in jeans or dress slacks. but It's a good sized knife so be sure to measure so you know what you are getting because it does take up some room if your pockets are small.Grip: excellentLanyard clip: NoneOne-hand opening: Not possible so far (though I suspect a little silicone spray might make it possible)Lock: seems excellentBlade: I'm not a knife fanatic so I can't tell you about the quality of materials in the blade but I can tell you that the blade is very sharp out of the box! Also. I love the angled tip for ripping packing tape (on boxes) so I don't have to use the blade side.Knife made in United States. The case is made in China.If anything changes quality wise I will be sure to update this review. So far I'm VERY happy with it."
9,"The best feature of this Gerber is its rubber grip. It is so comfortable in your hand. Wet or dry it does not slip in your hand. The steel is not very easy to sharpen but it holds its edge extremely well. You really cannot find a better general use pocket knife. If you're using this where there is a lot of moisture you will absolutely love the grip.There are only two things that I would like to have seen built into the Gator.1) a thumb 'pin' so that you can open this one handed.2) a hole in the handle for a lanyard.I find myself turning to my Gator more than I do my Spyederco's. other Gerbers. CRKT's. Ka Bar's and Sog's. It's my absolute favorite utility knife."
9,"I have been using a Gerber E-Z out knife for about 15 years.  I have lots of knives. as I'm a collector but this is my go-to blade for just about anything from fishing to cutting up boxes.  For the price. it's hard to get a better knife.  I still use my old one after 15 years. even though my wife bought me this new one last Christmas.  There's no reason to ever second guess whether or not you should buy this knife.  It's a no brainer.  The newer one changed ever so slightly. but for all practical purposes it's the same one I've been using all these years.  Just get it.......trust me!"
9,"I spent quite some time researching and trying to find a pocket knife that I liked that was made in the USA.  Unfortunately the information about that is very sketchy online.  This one doesn't say it anywhere. so I took a chance and got lucky that it had the Portland. OR stamp on the blade.  I have been using it for several months now and have absolutely no complaints about it.  I love the cut outs on the blade for one handed opening vs. the typical thumb posts.  It fits in my pocket very well and was extremely well sharpened when it arrived."
9,"Awesome Sharp knife. Had the old version for about 10 years and never needed to sharpen. It was not the skeleton like this but they do not make the non-skeleton version anymore of this. My old Gerber disappeared one day and I was sick about it. had a lot of memories tied to that knife. LOL...So decided to get this updated version of the model called the e-z out skeleton that they are selling now. SHARP. HOLDS an Edge and just kicks bottom. Took about a week to get use to flipping the blade out with one hand and thumb but now have that mastered.Love this knife so much keep it beside the bed at night and it is the first thing I look for when getting dressed in the morning."
9,"Had a Henckels International sharpening steel that came in a set with 6 or 7 other blades and a block.  It never seemed to keep things sharp. and in fact. I swear it made some newly sharpened knives worse.  Our son wants to be a chef and is currently a line cook. and when he saw our steel. he said it was so coarse that it was almost a joke.  He tried to fix up our Henckels International knives with his own steel. but the knives were too far gone.  I got the DMT diamond steel and it still has not done much with our Henckels International blades. made them better for sure. but has really ressurected som old Victorinox and Chicago Cutlery knives I took out of the basement.  Also fixed up my swiss army knife and Columbia River Knife and Tool pocket knife blades.  Worked so well I got a DMT serrated blade steel to go along with this item."
9,"4 month update!well after about 4 month it has completely lost it's sharpening ability. minding that i do a lot of cutting. and I used this on every knife around the house. However i was hopping that the diamond edge will hold longer. all an all i'm going to switch to sharpening stones.My Initial review:Sharpens the knives like never before! you need to know how to use a sharpening rod though ( plenty of youtube videos on it). rod usually alight the blade and not sharpen it though with this one you can sharpen the blade. works very well on a variety of steel grades."
9,"I got this to keep in my day pack while hunting. The size is perfect. it folds flat and takes no space but when it is open it is large enough to sharpen my any of my knives easily. My everyday clip knife gets abused. and I was able to quickly get it back to a sharp edge in short order with this. A lightweight American made product that sharpens knives well. it will be in my day pack all the time now. A must have for western elk hunters quartering up an elk."
9,"I bought a couple of these in different grits. They are really handy for keeping a keen edge on a working blade. My family is in construction. and I'm the only one who seems interested in doing much if any knife maintenance. I got this for my brother though so I don't have to resharpen the knives he uses as often. and it let's him keep safe sharp knives instead of dangerous dull ones. I may have to get a few more for other family members and then I might only have to sharpen my own knives."
9,"This shines as sort of an EDC type sharpener for Smaller blades.Great for your pocket knife. or neck knife.  Its pretty short. so it difficult to get a lot of purchaseon your blade with anything larger. though I guess it could be done if you really tried.Originally got this to test as part of a minimalist kit for use as my sharpener.....I decided there weredefinitely better options for that.This is one of those purchases that ended up totally working out. just not how I thought. as this thing is always with mein my day to day routine."
9,"This is the little brother of the DMT diafold.  Very light and small.  I keep one on my keychain.  The extended length when open. is an aid to keeping a constant angle.  I have never had one come apart but I suspect they are not as durable as the diafold and are not available two sided (two different grits) which of course. would be heavier.  Mine seem to be rust resistant for use with water to wash away metal dust which would otherwise accumulate on the surface.  These Mini Sharps are not for any work heavier than edge maintenance.UPDATE 9/7/2012:-- The molded-on flanges of the plastic handle broke off when I tried to unfold my Mini-Sharp. No more than normal force was applied.  It is now in two pieces.  I want an item like this to be dependable. Lowering my rating to one star."
9,"The DMT family of knife sharpening products are top shelf kit.  I use them in the kitchen and in the garage. from sharpening a shovel (yes. it really works better when the edge is sharp) to sharpening steak knives.  These were purchased to add to my truck tool box. small. easy to stow away.  They work very well. just remember to let the sharpening edge do the work for you. do NOT press down hard. you will just remove the diamond media and ruin the surface."
9,"I recently purchased this sharpener and instantly put it to use.I have a CRKT Zytel M16 knife that the steel is so hard I could not sharpen to my liking.I stroked both sides of the blade with the coarse side a few times and switched to the fine side.its worked great.the knife is now very sharp with minimum of honing.In my opinion this is the best knife sharpener I have used.and I have a few-coarse Arkansas and fine.also a Lansky system and I find this the fastest and easiest to use.I give it a +1.buy it you wont regret the purchase."
9,"This is a compact. handy. well made tool.  I debated giving it 4 stars because the handle material seems thin and perhaps a bit fragile. but. so far it holds up great and takes up very little space. all things considered. I also have a few Smith's diamond sharpeners and the DMT beats them all.  The folding design protects the surface when closed and provides a handle when open.  Tip: when using this as a typical bench whetstone. lean the far end of the sharpener on the table top.  Only add water or use it dry - anything else will gum it up.  Although this angles the stone. it steadies it. making for solid grining angle and surface.  I've sharpened a collection of knives and even got a really good edge on some scissors I was debating tossing - fist time sharpening scissors.  Look out edged tools!This is one of those tools I'd buy again to have a back-up.  MADE IN USA."
9,"I have a quite a few knives in my collection. ranging from spyderco's. benchmade. cold steel. ka bar to name a few. and this sharpener puts an extremely sharp and fine edge on all of them. It even makes cheap Chinese made knives hair shaving sharp. The DMT is by far the best and most simple to use sharpening stone I have ever come by. basically no skill is required to sharpen a knife with it. And hey it's made in the USA right in Massachusetts so u get good American quality. Don't think about it. just buy it!!"
9,"Got this to touch up some camping/survival blades and it seems to do the job well.  plastic cover is fairly hard and could probably go through some moderate abuse.  When opened. i like to support the hinge when sharpening (not saying it will break but it makes me feel batter).  Worked very well on my field dressing knife and i just spent a few minutes on the Ontario OKC3S bayonet.  I know the bayonet isnt meant to be &#34;cutting&#34; sharp. but i bought it to be a survival knife (cut rope. saw minor wood. cut clothes. etc.) and the edge I made in 5 minutes was much better than how it came from factory.  It will still require some time and tlc. as the steel seems exceptionally hard.All in all i recommend this product for any on the go sharpening needs.  comes in many grits so choose which ones you get wisely before saying the product doesnt meet your needs!"
9,"I have a saying.  'Give me your dullest knives. and I'll make them duller!'  I stink at sharpening knives.  Always have.  But since I purchased the DMT I've been able to keep all my blades in shaving sharp condition.  It does the job fast. and thats cool. because I can be impatient.  I have found that the fine side does most of the sharpening. and is adequate for most needs.  The lite. small. compactness of it makes it great for any trip where regular sharpening is required. ie. camping fishing. backpacking.  So for all you unskilled types (like me). you will be happy buying the DMT diafold sharpener."
9,"Before this purchase my idea of sharpening knives are sliding the blade thru an electric sharpener made by chef mate.While it does the job well i totally ruined a Cold steel Recon tanto knife.I purchased this because of the reviews and the video.And after playing around with it i got to sharpen my Cold steel knife back to the way it came...well almost but its really sharp.My observation specially with the folding knife is the coarse actually provide a better edge than the fine.Like i mentioned its my first time doing it and so far im really happy with it.Now im looking around the house finding something to sharpen LOL.Bottom line if you want a sharpener thats easy to use look no further.Im going to order another one for camping and the other one stays in the kitchen."
9,"I bought this as my wife had a diamond sharpener and her carving knifes are sharper than mine even though I used a whetstone and file. When it came from Amazon I sharpened my Beretta 2.5 inch. VG10 stainless. folding pocket knife.Trident modelin about 2 minutes.  The small depressions in the sharpener. are there for the purpose of catching the metal dust and filings and keeping the surface clean so theDiamonds in the surface can do their work. That was an excellent idea. The blade was so sharp. that drawing it across my forearm. the hair was cut clean to the surface. You won't go wrong with buying this sharpener."
9,"I didn't want to spend around thirty bucks to buy a small sharpener but I did... and it works the best so far. I have a few of them no skill type sharpeners like the fur ozitech or whatever its called and that doesn't work very good at all. but this sharpener works wonderfully. It is a little slower and harder to master but it allowed me to sharpen a few knives to shaving sharp. which is exactly what I wanted and couldn't do...until now. Just buy one! I bought the fine xtra-fine because I didn't want to buy 2 and I wanted to be able to shave with the knife when done sharpening. If your knife is dull it may take longer to get it to sharp but it will eventually."
9,"I live in an apartment and after attempting to sharpen some knives using other means with the DMT sharpening stones. I decided for safety reasons I needed to get a base. The base itself comes with rubber stoppers you have to install both at the base and where larger stones would sit. It is elevated comfortably enough above the surface it sits on that sharpening has become significantly easier. It does slide a little however on a kitchen counter top. I added some weight to the sides to help hold it down and that seemed to help it sit still better. I kind of wish the base itself was heavier so that I would need to do this every time but it still allows me a much better surface to sharpen my knives."
9,"This is a very nice street hockey set.  The sticks are very durable and they assemble fast with a phillips screwdriver.  The net is assembled by pressing the PVC tubes into the corner joints; Easy to do!  Both sticks work for left or right handers: Only slightly can you notice that one is for left and the other is for right.  However. we have all kinds of neighbor kids use them and they NEVER are concerned about the &#34;proper&#34; fitting of the stick.  They just use them....PERIOD!  Again. a great product and price."
9,"This is a great hockey net for the kids to use on the street or driveway. It's very sturdy and still light enough for my 8 year old to carry it around easily. The netting. the posts. and the sticks are all great quality for this price. This has a lot of bang for the buck. I liked it so much. I thought I was ordering two more (to keep at the in-laws) but instead I accidentally ordered  Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set. White which has these flimsy little posts and I know it'll end up broken in no time. At least I have one solid net to rely on and two crappy ones as spares. I HIGHLY recommend getting this one over the Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set. White!!"
9,"I bought a few of these for my family.  I think I still prefer the rally over this model since it gets rid of the scissors and adds a screwdriver instead.  Still. there is a reason why this is a &#34;classic&#34;!  You won't be disappointed with this small keychain knife.  I would suggest adding an extra keyring so the knife sits flush with your keys.  The one keyring it comes with will cause the knife to sit perpendicular to your keys. adding bulk."
9,"OK. so my main complaint on this knife is. it is seriously the smallest knife known to man. I realize there is a size listed in the description. but honestly. who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this. intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip. as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow. I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for. given that I lose the knife in my own hand. it's so small.Again. I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length. but seriously. nobody needs a knife this small.  I would return it. except I'm not sure it's worth the cost of return shipping."
9,"ORIGINAL:It is like a Yellow Ferrari :) The color in the picture is faithful to reality. All tool are excellent as expected but beware that this is very small knife. A true keyring thin short knife and micro scissors :)UPDATE:After first use. I noticed that the keyring is at the wrong end of the knife and right end of the scissors. Maybe this knife in reality is a nail-clipper (scissor to clip and file to smooth out and the knife is a novilty that goes with the name. I am updating my review to 1 just so they may listen otherwise the knife is worth 3.5 stars max 4.ACTIONI think we should all update our ratings to 1 for Victronix to listen up or as one of the reviewer said already that he has contacted them since 2o years ago but no one listen."
9,"Got it today. way quicker than I expected or was said. it's so cute. it's tiny. got it as a gift for my fathers b-day who has all mac stuff. laptop. phone and think ipod. so this goes along with his style. didn't take it out of the box so as not to finger print it up. though it is really cute and think he will like it.  Has toothpick and tweezers.  Assuming like my old faithful swiss is sharp as can be though won't find out till he gets it."
9,"We own three of these little Victorinox Swiss Army Knives. two of them on our car key rings and another one for my son. This knife has a good collection of tools. including a very good pair of mini-scissors (really!). a nail file and small flat head screwdriver. tweezers. plastic toothpick. and knife.The knife blades were a little duller than I expected. but a few quick passes with my sharpenerAccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpenerput a very good edge on them.We also have several of the larger Victorinox knives as well (includingVictorinox Swiss Army Champion Plus Pocket Knife) and have never been disappointed with any of their products.Highly Recommended!CFH"
9,"This is a great girlie knife.  It has the same tools/functionality as the classic Swiss small army knife but looks much nicer.  It is clear medium pink translucent with opaque pastel pink and medium lavendar color camo spots.  I have not kept it in my pocket. so I can't comment on how the design holds up while rubbing against keys.  I keep it on my desk to open boxes or use the other tools when needed.  The knife is super sharp. at least when new."
9,"I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it. so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift. even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool."
9,"It's a Swiss Army Classic. It's designed to hang on your keychain. You may read some reviews complaining the scissors or blade aren't very &#34;robust&#34; or it doesn't have this or that. If you want any of that they make SAKs for that. This is if you need a few basic functions on your key chain for cutting tags (knife). trimming loose threads (scissors). eliminating a stray hair (tweezers) or getting lunch out of your teeth (toothpick).Now that the rant on unrealistic expectations out of the way. I can get back to the product. Victorinox continues to do a nice job with the Classic. Quality is what I expect from an SAK. small and functional little knife. I carry it every day just like my Dad taught me."
9,"I love these things.  Perfect for a keychain.  Has exactly the tools you need. and nothing more.  Small as you can get to have the tools you need.Funny story. I always have one of these on my keychain and I forgot to take it off when I was getting on a plane.  It was confiscated. so I used my phone on the way to the terminal to order a new one with Amazon Prime. and it was waiting at my doorstep when I got home.  I heart capitalism."
9,"I have bought these at Target. Walmart. Amazon. and probably other places - I've bought so many I can't remember.  My last several have been from Amazon and have been very happy with the service.All I need is a little pen knife and I appreciate the size and the tools that are included.  I sharpen the blade when it gets dull and eventually I replace the whole knife when I lose it (like happened the last time) or just starts looking too worn out from being in my pocket with my keys. etc.I expect that I'll keep buying them for the rest of my life."
9,"Each year. I give these little classic knives as gifts to an assortment of people.  With the restrictions on knives on aircraft now. they are always appreciated.  Since owning and using these on a daily basis for many years. I have yet to have one break or be problematic.  I do oil the hinges every year or so at least. more when the knife is used often.  It's the most basic knife without bells and whistles and I love it.  They are offered in a wide variety of colors and patterns and usually can be found for $10 or less.  The Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is the best in it's class and at the low cost. it's not heartbreaking when one is lost.  It's also nice to have a couple on hand in the gift box for the times when someone compliments mine -- I give it away and know that I have a replacement at home."
9,"I love these little seven function knives which are made in Switzerland.  It fits easily in any pocket even attached to a keychain.  The tools are: knife. nail file. screwdriver. scissors. tweezers. toothpick. and key ring. Although it's not big. I have found that it can be adapted to do many things. The knife you have &#34;with you&#34; is much better than the bigger one you left at home.  The scissors and the knife blade are quite sharp and are made from good steel.  A friend that I gave one to discovered a new use.  If you pluck the tweezers like a tuning fork it makes a musical note.  Great if you can sing. The white color is very nice looking."
9,"As soon as I learned that TSA has announce plans to allow small knives starting April 25. I rushed to my computer and bought a new one.The knife is a great basic tool - small scissors. tweezers. a small knife. and a nail file/flat screwdriver.  I wish that it had an LED light. and some mini pliers would be nice. but this is pretty good for a key ring.More detail on the TSA: according to what I've read. the TSA is planning to allow knives under 6 centimeters in length and 1.27 centimeters in width. starting April 25. 2013.  I suppose plans could change. but from what I can tell. this should qualify.Update: After some more research. I probably prefer theVictorinox Midnite Manager. which adds a Philips screwdriver. a bottle opener. and a pen. but loses the tweezers and toothpick.  This is still a great tool. though. and less pricey. so poke around and see what you like."
9,"To me. these knives are like socks in the dryer. Every so often I just lose one. But like socks. I use this knife daily. Not as a knife proper. but to pick on things. open this or that. fasten or tighten a screw. I finally learned not to use my teeth to rip on packages and find this knife in my pocket instead. The small jeans pocket. This should be a standard issue. everybody should have one and the TSA should lay off. Nobody is going to highjack a plane with this one."
9,"I have been carrying one of these as long as I can remember. at least 20 years.  It is the most usefult single thing I have.  My wife always raises an eyebrow when I say that.  I call it my WMD (Weapon of Minimal Destruction).This is the Victorinox version.  There is also a version made by Wenger.  As I understand it. Victorinox and Wenger are at odds about who is the 'original' swiss army knife.  I don't care who is right about that. but I think the Victorinox version of the knife is nicer.  It's a bit thinner. operates more smoothly. and is finished a little nicer."
9,"I have owned many different Swiss Army and leatherman knives.  In the end. the only things you really end up using are the scissors and the blade.  This has both of them - although they are quite small.  This is not one of the full size knives.  This is more of a 'keychain' knife.  Although you will need to be careful not to take this to the airport.  I keep one of these in my desk drawer at work and another near the front door (for use opening packages.)"
9,"I've owned several of these knives some I've lost. and some I have given away to friends. I am one of those guys that is never without a knife.  I can't always carry a full size pocket knife as a nurse. so when I'm at work this is my blade of choice. It is a simple but functional item. I have used every feature on the knife and they all work like champs! Even when I do carry a full size pocket knife. I still keep this one in my pocket. Bigger blades can be nice but often they are overkill for the average task. It is small. light. non-bulky. non-threatening. and super functional. I don't know any person that wouldn't benefit from this classic little pocket knife. ALWAYS the perfect gift. If you want thinner. go for the alloy one without the toothpick/tweezers."
9,"Like countless other dads over the years i got this for my ten year old for his first pocket knife and he loved it before announcing that it was too small and inquiring as to the possibility of obtaining a switch blade to replace it.  After a brief but intense discussion. he is now quite happy to still have access to this little tool.  What can really be said about a product like this other than &#34;it lives up to it's reputation&#34;.  The company and the product have been around forever and it does exactly what you would expect it to.  No one is going to cut down a tree. or cut anything more substantial than some heavy twine with this but it's a great introduction to responsible tool ownership and use and an essential accessory for every well rounded American boy."
9,"I'm liking this little guy. I have tried so many keychain tools...the Gerber Shard was my last experiment. but finally got tired of poking my leg when in the pocket. or jabbing my fingers when reaching into the pocket for it.  I'm not sure if I'll ever use the scissors. but they sure are sweet to play with! The blade is so tiny it's hard to call it a knife. but...so far it's sliced it's way into my heart. metaphorically speaking. of course. otherwise I'd probably be in ER instead of writing this review..."
9,"Kidding.  I've had the Classic SD for about 2 weeks now and am in love with it.  I bought it as a set along with the larger Tinker.  All tools function well.  My favorite is the toothpick.  The fingernale file comes in at a close second.  the little blade is sharp and workes well for its size.  This would be a usefull peice to add to a first aid kit. but this one travels in my pocket as my mini EDC.  Funny how quickly a small multi tool can become indespensible.  I rotate all my other blades. but this one is my constant companion.  Now if only they would add a corkscrew."
9,"Looked forward to replacing my Classic knife on my keychain because the scissor feature did not perform well.  The two halves of the scissor bind and only open partially unless you manually assist it each stroke.  So I ordered a new one.  It arrived. incorrect style. quickly corrected by Amazon customer service.  But the correct knife arrived and was a continued quality disappointment.  The scissor feature on the new one is as bad as the old one.  I have many Swiss Army knives and have previously believed their quality and customer service were first rate.  I contacted SA and received a response stating they would look into my quality concern.  A couple weeks went by and they replied that their scissor spring had not changed.  Period.  Hardly addresses the poor performance I reported to them.  And the spring was never the problem anyway.  The two cutting faces of the scissor are too tight.Bottom line ... Poor or deteriorating product quality and sadly poor customer service to match."
9,"It's funny to me that this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is actually labeled a 'knife.'  Like other Swiss army knives. there are multiple functions.  I've used the scissors more than anything. but the single slim knife blade does come in handy.  Unless the TSA takes it away.  eventually the spring for the scissors will eventually break. and you'll lose the toothpick. the tweezers. or both.  Then. perhaps. it's time for a replacement.  Until then. however. you have a fabulous mini utility tool to help you with your life functions!"
9,"I'll start by saying this knife may be small. but it is sturdy. It is perfect to carry on you keyring as it's small size won't make your keys excessively bulky and yet it has everything you'd need for day to day uses. It has a knife that is great for cutting small items (string and packaging etc) and although i've had mine for years it is still as sharp as the day I bought it. The scissors may be a touch fiddly but they are sharp and function well. The file and screwdriver have also come in handy at various times. These knives are always well made and their reputation is well deserved. they manage to be aesthetically pleasing. easy to use and sturdy all at the same time. no mean feat. A good entry level swiss army knife and perfect for small jobs whilst out and about.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
9,"I like to have this small one in my pocket for daily use.  It's small enough so it is less bulky than my car key and alarm bob.  It has the basic knife. combination screwdriver and nail file. and a small scissor; everything I've needed in a pinch when at work or out-and-about.  There's a pull out tweezer and toothpick. but I rarely use those.  Unfortunately. I had to give my last one to TSA at the airport.  I've gotten so used to slipping it into my pocket. it's hard to purposely not take it along."
9,"A small. sharp knife. combination file and small screwdriver. tweezer. toothpick. and small scissors. all in one package that can go on your keyring. What could be cooler? You'll be surprised at how often you use the Classic.The only question is. should you get the Classic. or the Rally. which is the identical pocket knife. but with a combination small philips head screwdriver / bottle opener instead of the scissor?It's a matter of which you get the most use out of; I have both but prefer the Rally for the bottle opener. Most people have the Classic. perhaps because the Rally is newer and isn't as well-known.Have a look at the Rally before you decide; it is on the Amazon website for the same price."
9,"Just so nobody gets confused here. this is a very small pocket knife. To be worn on a key chain. Nothing remotely what is considered EDC (every day carry). But here is why I got it: You get a small blade which is good enough to cut open little packages/string/etc. Scissors. a nail file and what I like the best....tweezers and a toothpick. None of the high priced Leatherman etc. multitools have tweezers. and if you ever had a nasty splinter you know how important tweezers can be."
9,"This knife is so handy. When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it. I thought I would have to replace it right away. I am amazed that I have not lost it. The blade is very sharp. The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car. after purchasing something in the store. It is a very sharp. sturdy for it's size and just a great little knife. I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition. I highly recommend this knife."
9,"As a novelty. I got this to check out and see how useful it was.  But I was really most interested to see if TSA agents would have a fit about it.  The x-ray operators either didn't spot it in my bag or weren't too concerned about it (on either leg of my last round trip flight).The knife is too small for anything too useful other than maybe a letter opener or to poke through the seal on your bottle of Advil.The pen is interesting. but a little hard to manage if you have big hands.It probably would be most useful in your toiletries kit for when you're travelling."
9,"I wish they had the attachment to use different socket tips. FIrst day I took it up into the Alpine regieon of the Rocky MOuntains. BAMB! I cut my thumb on the blade!  Old EMT trainng came into effect ... hehe.  I will comment later when I use it more. I bought this to see how will the saw blades will work for carving/sawing wooden triggers for snares and dead falls. Not sure this device will be up to it.It's slick and easy to keep clean.  The pouch is nice and I wear it when I go out of the house I do have confidence it will come in handy for several years.UPDATE:After 3 months I bought another as my son wanted a version of a Leatherman ... so I bought him this one. Be careful ... I cut myself again!"
9,"I've wanted one of these tools for a long time and I finally decided to go for it. I've handled the SwissTool as well as multi tools by Leatherman and SOG. which are brands I highly respect. I decided for the SwissTool because it feels more like a 'real' tool than the others. It is simply more substantial. appears to be sturdier. The tools locking open is also a great feature and that alone had a lot to do with my choice. You can't go wrong with any of the 3 name brands but if you need durability the choice is easier.Note: the tool comes with a sheath. So unless you dislike nylon. you don't need to order the sheath separately."
9,"What I like:Aesthetically pleasing to look at. handle and use.  The stainless steel is very appealing. and holds a nice shine.  The tools opening and locking have a very substantial. visceral click.  The curve of the plyer handles are very comfortable.It comes with a very nice. light-weight nylon SNAP pouch (I hate the velcro ones).It's lighter in weight than a Leatherman Surge. which is what I carried for the past ten years.What I dislike:Nothing.  I'm willing to sacrifice one-handed blade deployment for what I consider an aesthetically superior MT."
9,"The Victorinox Swiss Tool RS is just what I was looking for - a mini tool set. I can't wait to try them all out. This is one of those 'don't leave home without it' items and comes in handy when I go hunting and fishing. While. you can't carry every tool with you to handle each and every unforseen emergency situation. this Victorinox comes as close as any to being able to do just that. It's a little too big to keep in my pocket but since it comes with a sturdy case it works fine on my belt.My Marine Corps experiences from the cold of Norway to the steaming jungles of Panama tells me this is a winner. Just like myVictorinox Swiss Army Explorer with Free Pouch. this is truly a quality product. one that you can count on to get the job done.  You will definitely be glad you ordered it. I know I am. ~ The Boss"
9,"I own several brands of Multi-tools. SOG. Gerber. Leatherman and now Victorinox. Nothing against the other brands. they are each very good in their own right. but this tool is nothing less than the Swiss perfection that you would expect from Victorinox. The pliers are very smooth and not stiff like the other brands (with exception to the spring assisted Gerber EVO or Butterfly). And the accessories are the easiest of all brands to open. they work just as smooth as opening up any Victorinox knife. and I might add they are also just as sharp. The only thing that could make this better is the opening of the pliers; I have yet to find any multi-tool that opens as smooth and as easy as the gear driven SOG PowerLock. Just my $0.02.....!!! I highly recommend the RS and would definitely buy this one again."
9,"I had been wanting a multitool with a good set of pliers for a long time now.  But with all the choices on the market and most of them being less than cheap I didn't know what to do.  Then I saw Victorinox made multitools and they had really good ratings.  As soon as I saw the Swiss Army brand I was sold.  If you're looking for a solidly built multi tool this is a great choice.  I like how all the tools lock into place and I think the pliers are a good size and shape to handle a variety of uses."
9,"Out of the box you will be impressed with this great multitool! Beautifully polished. individual locking tools that don't clump when you open them. That pliers are not needle nose but I like the compromise. The stout but slightly rounded nose is precise enough for most precision jobs but because the metal is of softer material I can understand why they don't included it. The craftsmanship on this tool is top notch and better than any other multitool I ever had. What more can I say. it's a victorinox!"
9,"This is a beautifully constructed. solid tool. Being so it is on the heavy side. The only faults that I find with it are: the phillips head screwdriver blade is hard to remove and there are three slot head screwdriver blades. In this day and age it is rare to find a slot headed screw and rarer still to need three different blades. On the other hand. the one phillips headed screw driver is of an in-between size (size 1?). a larger or smaller one would be more useful. I have found that it works fairly well with larger Phillips head screws.The locking mechanism for the blades is positive and easy to remove.I agree that the snap closure on the holster is inadequate.If the combination that includes three flat screw driver blades works for you then this tool is nearly perfect."
9,"In my opinion. this is the best multi-tool that can be had.I did a lot of shopping around for a larger multi-tool.If you just get out there and simply handle them. you willfeel the superiority of quality in this tool.Every tool is solid and useful. every tool has a nice crispsnap.  Its a little heavy....but its a larger mult-tool andso is pretty much on par with its competitors as far as weight.I think the price tag is acceptable. as this thing will last youa lifetime.I know there are a lot of leatherman fans out there that will tell youleatherman is the only way to go and is American made!Thats all nice and good....but I would advise you just get out there andplay with a few of these...like I said. you will feel the quality of the swiss-toolover the leatherman.  I like buying American products too....but when it comesdown to it. I'm going with quality."
9,"This one has all the tools I was looking for - sturdy pliers. scissors. sharp plain edge blade. file. saw. and the all-important awl which seems to be a hard to find feature these days. I own several Leathermans. and I can't stand how their tools clump together and are difficult to deploy. The Swisstool has no such problems. Every tool is easy to deploy individually. and locks in place. Also important is that the tools can be deployed without having to open the pliers. The product has good fit and finish. is reasonably comfortable to hold. and has no sharp edges poking my hand where they shouldn't. The included holster holds the tool securely. I didn't observe the problem of it opening too easily as mentioned elsewhere."
9,"I owe Wave and Vic.X tool as I found them to be the best of the best on the market among multitools. Recently I bought Leatherman TTi Charge(the most expensive one) and pliers broke with first hard squeeze... that was unacceptable for me and I returned it. I owe first Wave and X tool for 4 years now and will say that for more delicate job you probably would want Leatherman Wave but for the tough job (any job)- X tool is 100% the leader. Just look ahead of time and decide where. and how. you will most likely use your 'knives'. The best future for me over Wave is quality of steel. I didn't see anything of the same or better steel quality in other knives yet. The best description I found from Aj Viljoen here: [...] Good Luck !"
9,"After a traumatic experience with my old knife (also Swiss Army) that involved an impossible to open wine bottle. I was in need of a new knife.  I searched and searched with the following requirements.  It had to have both a small and large blade.  It needed a phillips and flat screwdriver.  It also needed the punch. toothpick. and tweezers.  I found what I needed in the tinker.  Its two blades wide. and the length in the description is accurate. no extra bulges in my pocket.  I can easily say that i use it 4-5 times a day."
9,"This knife has lasted me over 4 years already .but anyways there is one bad thing about this knife. it can easily get scratched if dropped. which is a problem i have encountered many times. but the cool thing is that if you drop it in a pond or a lake. it will not rust at all. it is a very good knife and have only lost the toothpick and the tweezers.and this knife is almost indestructible. i could try and smash it with a hammer and it would be perfectly fine. but do not attempt to smash it or it could leave a dent on the steel. also. all Victorinox knives are made in Switzerland.BOTTOM LINE:best knife ever!!!"
9,"Got this SAK for my brother for Christmas. It had everything that he wanted without some of the extras that can end up making it too bulky for carrying daily. Personally. I don't consider the absence of scissors to be a real loss since it is a knife and comes with a pretty sharp blade (two sharp blades actually). but that's just me. Although a locking blade is always preferred. all the implements in the SAK 'lock'/snap into place pretty firmly and don't pose as much of a hazard as other non-locking blades. Like any Victorinox. the quality of materials is high and the expectance of performance is commensurate. It really is a classic knife."
9,"I have owned several Swiss Army knives including the Hunter. Champion. Climber and this small Tinker. I find out of all of them that I carry and use the Tinker the most because of its size and tools. While the other might have more 'tools'. I don't really use any of them and really just need a larger blade. bottle opener. philips and flathead screw driver. The large blade I can cut apples or really anything since the size is great. Some people think they need a pair of scissors but the blade is sharp enough on the smaller blade that I just use that to cut paper. The size is great too since its thinner without what I would call unnecessary tools so it easily slips into your pocket or briefcase. Personally I like this Swiss Army knife the best."
9,"I've found the Tinker series pocketknives to be some of the best day to day knives available.  First. its the perfect size to hide in your pocket comfortably.  Secondly. it has the essential tools needed:  phillips screwdriver. flathead screwdriver. can and bottle openers. tweezers. and toothpick.  The long blade and short blade are both useful and just the right size.  The knife is high quality Swiss made and at a reasonable price.  The small Tinker measures 3 1/4' and the regular Tinker is 3 1/2'.  Although 1/4' doesn't seem like a big difference. you can tell when its in your pocket.  Both are great knives though.  You can't go wrong with any of the Tinker knives."
9,"I have a whole mess of knives. This is probably the cheapest knife I own and still use on a regular basis. I'm particular to higher end Spydercos but wanted something with more versatility that I could beat up and not worry about. All of the tools on the Tinker are well made with very even and smooth metal finishings. The knife came well oiled and in great condition. After a couple months of use the red scales have taken a bit of a beating and are very scratched. This doesn't bother me. though. as it's only noticeable when the knife is held at a certain angle.The size of the Tinker works very well for EDC. It's unobtrusive in my pocket but large enough to get a good grip on. One thing I absolutely love is that the flat-head screwdriver locks into a ninety degree position. making the turning of screws very easy and natural feeling. I'd definitely buy another SAK Tinker."
9,"I have used just about every tool on this knife.  The can opener really works.  It is handy to have two knife blades.  One can be kept extra sharp for cutting paper. as in cutting articles from magazines and such.  The other can be used for more ordinary and varied jobs.  The Phillips screwdriver is a little cumbersome because you are restricted to a 90 degree angle to the handle for its use.  This makes it difficult to use when tightening the mounting screws on a door's lockset.  I also ground away the square corner so the Phillips screwdriver would fit into round holes.  I did square off the small screwdriver blade at the end of the can opener so it grabs better.  The wire stripper is of questionable value.  The metal Swiss Army Knife emblem came off of my knife after a while.  The stainless steel blades hold an edge very well.  I have had mine for 30 years."
9,"Been looking around for a useful little knife with a couple of cutting blades. a flat head and Phillips screwdriver. and a can opener in a pocket-friendly form factor that I can carry at work and everywhere else. one that if I drag it out and deploy a cutting edge to open a box or package or something. people won't run screaming into the streets. This one fits the bill on every count. I already used it to open a small package in front of another employee and she didn't freak or anything! The can opener and awl blade add some versatility to the Tinker's resume as a fixer of stuff in the field. beside a creek. or if I hole up in a developed campground where a laser-guided Wundermesser isn't really called for. It's enough knife for the discreet everyday chores it's meant to handle. and it's thin and unobtrusive riding in the coin/watch pocket of my denim jeans. Life is good."
9,"About ten years ago friends got me one of these for a birthday present and since then I have become dependent on one. I am a millwright by trade and a tinkerer by heart. This is the handiest tool to keep in ones pocket. Forget Leathermen or the like. This tool takes very little space for what it can do.The cutting blades hold and edge as good as any knife.better than Buck. I lost my original last week :(. I cut some rope at a lumberyard to bind a load in my truck and must have left it on the bumper. When I could not find it I immediately came here and ordered another.This thing is hard to beat."
9,"I got this for my father-in-law for Christmas. The knife is a smidge bigger than what I would have liked. however. it does have all the basic tools I would want in a Swiss Army Knife. After reviewing multiple knives I don't think there is another that has this convenient a set of tools. There are others with more bells and whistles. but I wouldn't want to have anything bigger for daily carry. If you are willing to sacrifice some tools there are smaller knives. but then you find yourself missing things when you need them. This knife is a good balance in the middle. Quality is what you would expect from a Swiss Army Knife."
9,"This is a great design for EDC in polite company. when you don't want to pull out a red knife!  It is amazing that a 125 year old company is still coming up with something new and really in tune with the times.A little thinner than my usual Explorer. with everything important. lacking only the magnifying glass and Phillips screwdriver.I always have to say that Victorinox is definitely THE brand of Quality for SAK's.  Their factory-original blades last longer than Wenger. and much longer than ****ty Chinese knock-offs. most of which are nearly impossible to resharpen."
9,"The blades are really. really sharp. compared to the (at least) 20-year-old well-worn Wenger this replaced when the Wenger was lost somewhere. This one has a few more tricks. so it's a bit fatter. Not sure I needed them. but there they are. I like having a knife and a corkscrew around. The screwdriver blades are rarely useful. the scissor a bit more useful once-in-a-while. The hook? Oy. I do like the hole punch-reamer belt-hole maker thing. There's a toothpick I'll lose. also the pretty much useless tweezers. Take the cost of these things. spread it out over however many years they last... good deal."
9,"I can not say enough about the quality of Victorinox knifes.  Owned Spartan since November of 1978.They have never disappointed me except once when I drop my Explorer and the scale cracked.They would no longer send you a replacement scale you had to mail the knife in.I had a similar problem in 1988 and they just mailed me the scale and a new spring for my mini-scissors after we talked on the phone.If you need a tougher knife just get the Silver Alox type. limited styles no toothpick or tweezers but they are great."
9,"This is a really nice pocket knife. hurry and get one before you come down with scurvy!The next time I buy some oranges I'm going to try out this orange peeler blade.The file is nice and the scissors are noticeably better than on the 58mm (smallest) SAKs. and those scissors aren't even all that bad.I think that this may be one of the best compromises in size vs utility - it is very easy to pocket but comes with some nice tools.It is also not a bad choice to pair with a SAK or multi-tool that doesn't come with scissors."
9,"The Executive is perfect. I've owned one since spring of 2006 and it has never let me down since. I lost it once but my dog found it for me. I think the size of this knife is perfect. it is not as small as they come nor as big as they come. It is still big enough for heavy use however. This knife is a better option than the big Victorinox knife.I used to think that the tweezers. toothpick. orange-peeler. and nail file were pretty much useless. but they really arn't. I can't go a day now without all these tools! These knives will last forever...I promise....but they will scratch and so on. But who cares ya'll! This is the perfect knife and gift for anyone who loves good ol' fashioned quality.Buy this knife!!!!"
9,"My daughter said 'the grip wasn't the best. and it didn't bounce as well as other balls she has had in the past'. She is only ten years old but she loves basketball and the ball was for her so I thought you should hear her point of view. The ball has been serviceable and is very good for the price.  I must also say that it has taken a beating with all my children and the neighbors children as well giving it a torture treatment every day . yet it still bounces and it still is in one piece."
9,"I took this on it's first trip this weekend. We hiked to a isolated lake inside of an island in Michigan. This was about a 5 mile hike. The boat is pretty lightweight. I had no issue rolling and strapping it to my backpack. The pump took a good amount of time to get the raft nice and inflated. but it held air for the remainder of the trip.I fished out of the raft for 4 days. I constantly had hooks rubbing against the rubber and never once did it puncture. I was pretty rough against the paddle-holders and they held up nicely. The boat moved through the water rather well for an inflatable raft. no complaints there.This is good for one grown adult and maybe a child. This fit myself and my fishing gear pretty comfortably. We used the explorer 300 for two adults. and that worked well."
9,"This little boat was a good price and came with the oars (they are expensive if you purchase alone).  I got this boat and the oars for only $4-5 more than just the oars. so we were happy. we now have two little boats (and yes. one set of oars).  Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore.  I wouldn't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up. but we've had ours for a year and it's still holding original air. so that boasts well for the quality."
9,"This thing is amazing! I go on river floats basically every other weekend in the summer and this is used as the beer barge where we keep our shoes. coolers. keys etc. Not only does it admirably hold all the weight loaded into it. it has so far remained completely damaged even though people repeatedly throw crushed beer cans and bottle caps in it. I've only used it a couple times as a person floater but it had ample space for me (6'2&#34; -185lbs) and I didn't feel like it was going to sink. I've also not used the oars yet. If I were going to make this purchase again. I probably would look at getting something that could hold two people for me and a friend to go play around in the creeks etc but I'm not sure that they make anything as cheap as I want that does all that. I highly recommend this boat and the full Intex line to anyone looking for river float craft."
9,"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour. 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However. if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
9,"Arrived fast. I blew it up to check for holes since we don't plan on using it until this summer. The oars were fairly easy to assemble. The pump is cheap and fell apart easily but we have a nicer one that we use anyway. The kids loved playing in the boat once it was blown up (even if only in the living room). I can't wait to take this to the lake this summer. It's going to be a huge hit with the kids. Deflated easily for storage."
9,"I bought this boat for my grandson to use at the beach. The ocean was rough. but my granddaughter and two of her cousins rode in the boat at the same time and had an absolute blast riding breakers in to the beach. The bottom inflates separately. so don't forget to inflate it as well. The only thing I really did not like is the inflation valve. It is one of those valves that comes on any cheap float or tube you buy at the beach. The Intex River Run tube I bought for my granddaughter had a heavy duty inflation valve that you could unscrew and it would deflate instantly. The valve on this boat (also an Intex product) you must squeeze together to let air out and it took a long. long time to deflate. If this boat had the same valve that comes on the River Rub tube I would give it 5 stars."
9,"The Good:  I have been using this soap for years.  From camping to my shower. I love its simple and cleansing feeling.  There is no oily residue after you wash it off. and the peppermint really lets you know you are clean with that zing it packs.  I have fairly oily skin and usual body soaps never really left me feeling like I had cleaned my pores and stripped away all the grime.  This soap does just that.  Finally. when using a lufa. this soap suds of tremendously.The Bad:  There really is nothing bad to say about this soap.  Some might consider it on the expensive side. but you wash yourself every single day. sometimes twice a day. so why not spend a little more to get a really great soap?"
9,"It didn't clean my hands. which weren't very dirty in the first place and it ruined my hair.Maybe it's just me. but I tried one *drop* for washing my hair. Even pre-mixed it with warm water. No amount of rinsing could get it out of my hair. It left my hair all greasy/oily. My hair was cleaner before I put this horrid stuff in it!Had to re-wash a FEW times with regular shampoo to get it all out.Now I don't dare use it on anything else. It's awful. Sitting on a shelf collecting dust."
9,"The smell is amazing. It smells just like you have squeezed some oranges and lemons. It doesn't have that bad fake citrus scent. In that regard this soap is excellent. When I use the soap it doesn't dry out my skin like so many other soaps and for this I am grateful since I have to wash my hands several times a day. I have one word of caution though this soap is thinner than most soaps I have used so you must be careful when you are using it so that you dont use too much. But once you realize this it is not a problem."
9,"I made my first batch of diy laundry detergent this morning.  I used one cup of sodium carbonate (aka soda ash) along with one cup of borax powder then I grated a bar of fels-Naptha soap.  I combined all of these ingredients into a giant pot of 'near' boiling water (5 quarts). Here is where I added 2 ounces of Dr. Bonner's Magic Soap Peppermint.  I just let it all melt with the burner turned off.  I only had to stir it a few times until it was all blended.I have also used this peppermint soap for shaving. showering and shampooing.  I do not have sensitive skin.  I like to wash my hands with it as well.  It only takes about one or two drops to wash my hands.A little bit goes a long way.I took a little bottle to work with me so I could use it all day.You will like it too."
9,"All natural. does not polute. no chemicals on your skin. all natural. So natural you can brush your teeth with it! It has been a favorite of us backpackers for years and only a few drops will usally do the job. I have tried the Almond. Citrus. Eucalyptus.Tea Tree. and Peppermint. My favorite is the Peppermint which leaves you tingling and smells great. and taste's allot better than the others for brushing your teeth. If used right a bottle will last a very. very. long time. You can also wash clothes. dishes. whatever. with it. There are several stories about it and its creator on the web. A peculiar history for a great product. that is still made by the same family operation.I started by just using it for backpacking and now get it to use at home too."
9,"As a shampoo it's great. although my hair feels rubbery during the first lather after the second and a towel dry it feels really soft. If you have to shampoo regularly. every other day should be fine with this stuff.As a body wash it's great. the tingle is really noticeable...especially if you leave the lather in between your legs for too long it can get uncomfortably tingly so unless that's your thing. beware.It lasts a LOOOONG time. It's called magic because of how easily the oil lathers up. half a palm full should be enough to wash your hair and body easily.The smell is pretty strong compared to the others but I'm pretty sure it depends on the batch. the bottle I'm using now isn't overpowering but a lot of people have gotten bottles with too much peppermint"
9,"I bought this for its natural ingredients. Product smells great-leaves me cheerful when i shower in the early AM. I used it to clean all of my makeup brushes and it worked great. People say one should use baby shampoo since it is the most sensitive. however. they are mistaken since most mainstream products contain harmful agents such as parabens and phalates. (YES EVEN BABY SHAMPOO!) Dr. Bronner's Soaps do not. hence the reason to use it instead. Plus it has multiple purposes; who can beat that?! I wouldn't recommend it as a shampoo unless you dilute it and have semi greasy hair. I have combination and it dried mine out a bit."
9,"I use this soap to wash my face. and I have also used it to wash my hair.  What I like about this soap. is that it also clears my sinuses in the shower. which is an added bonus. as I always have sinus issues during allergy season.  The soap does feel a bit drying on the skin initially. but it doesn't feel squeaky clean like it does with sulphate soaps.  I think I'm probably using way too much. as a tiny bit goes a very long way.  I really like this soap. and it will certainly be a staple in my house for a long time. given the incredible sinus clearing added bonus.  I used to use a neti pot. but I stopped using it because I read about the brain eating amoeba that can be found in our water supply. and it freaked me out.  I don't need a neti pot anymore; score!"
9,"Dr. Bronner's soap is truly the best: it's all-natural. mainly organic. all vegan. handmade. and comes from an ethical* company. Although it might seem pricy for the amount of soap you get. remember that's its highly condensed. so a little goes a long way. It's a wonderful sensation of plant blends and I love the clean crisp fragrance of citrus. I mix this with essential oils to make a shampoo/soap that works best for my skin and hair type. It's amazing what ailments plant-derived materials can relieve!*The company uses Fair Trade ingredients and caps the highest-paid employee's pay at seven times that of the lowest-paid employee."
9,"I bought a 32oz peppermint one based on Backpacker Magazine's recommendation.  The 4oz bottle in REI sold for close to $5 therefore the 32oz here for $15 is a super bargain!.I chose peppermint so that I can use it as face/body/laundry/dish liquid and tooth brushing.  A tiny little bit is MORE THAN ENOUGH to wash the face and neck.  For you superlight backpackers. this is a must have for the functionality. weight to use ratio. and biodegradability.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
9,"So. my hubby and sons use it for body and hair and it sure does the job well!  Great for a feel-fresh anytime feeling of cool. this rinses away clean and the refreshing smell is invigorating. but dissipates quickly enough that it isn't overwhelming.  The guys have buzz cuts. so it is perfect for hair and body and we dilute it for use in foaming hand-soap dispensers as well.  I wouldn't recommend it for longer hair. as I believe something more buffered with conditioners would be better suited.  All in all. it is great for multi-uses. goes a long way diluted. and washes away clean.  Even my ultra sensitive skin responds well . . . A great value on Amazon - you can save LOTS OF $$$$ using this product."
9,"People complain about the lavender smell.  Yes it is STRONG when you smell right from the bottle.  Actually using it as a soap/shampoo it leaves a very faint smell.  You just have a nice clean smell with a hint of the lavender.  I have used Dove body wash for years and this is a much better product.  It doesn't have the lotion that products like Dove contain. but it has a really nice. clean. refreshing feel and smell that is hard to beat.  No lotion-like residue like the Dove... but still the skin is pretty moisturized.It doesn't foam up quite as much as most commercial soaps. but you actually use about the same. or less. of this product to get the same level of cleanliness.  Plus being fair trade. environmentally friendly. and having an ingredient list that is actually comprehensible is a huge plus.I will never go back to Dove... and will stick with this unless I end up finding something superior."
9,"This is good stuff. smells strongly of Peppermint. even when diluted. If you are good with that you will love this stuff for cleaning your body. countertops. etc. Be advised that if using this to clean your body a little bit goes a long way. If you are at all sensitive you may want to use the Baby mild or perhaps the Almond formula as this soap leaves your skin literally tingling. I feel cleaner and more refreshed when using this soap on my body than any bar soap I have ever used. Good stuff."
9,"I honestly have known about this soap my whole life and have never tried it. Such a shame that I waited to try it! I am using it for my laundry because every other soap for laundry leaves a residue and I can't tolerate all the perfumes in most detergent! I like that there is a light fragrance for laundry but still you can smell the cotton. denim or whatever else you wash! Great for delicates  too! I tried using in the shower and it was awesome there too! Rinses off your body leaving you feeling clean. I used it to wash my hair and I must say. I wouldn't use it all the time for that. The occasional hair washing to get our all of the &#34;hair product&#34; residue maybe. but I'm concerned it would leave my hair dry because it cleanses so thoroughly! Recommended 100% for almost anything else though!"
9,"Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time."
9,"I was introduced to Dr. Bronner's organic peppermint soap by a very health conscious girlfriend in California. way back in 1979. and I've been a loyal fan ever since. The tingly peppermint feeling I get when showering with this stuff is like no other soap product I've ever used. Just put a couple of squirts on a facecloth for a ton of super-rich lather that serves as both shampoo and body wash. Very refreshing. I ALWAYS keep a couple of big bottles in reserve. I never want want to run out of Dr.Bronner's excellent product."
9,"I love the smell of this.  It is the srongest that I have smelled and makes a rich later.  It is rather pricey so I recylce my lather pumping hand soap bottles and use this in it.  Basically fill the empty foaming soap bottle 2/3 full of water and fill up the rest of the way with Dr. Bronner's (leave about an inch so there is room for the pump).  Close it up tight and shake.  You will still get the same great scent but the bottle will last so much longer."
9,"Dr. Bronner's products are very very good.  I use this particular Castile - Tea Tree product in the shower.  A little goes a long way.  The main thing is that it really does work!  It will really clear up what ails ya!  I use it as a shampoo too!  My scalp has never felt better.  Just understand that natural products such as this do not have chemicals to make them suds up a huge amount.  If a soap product such as this suds up heavily... then it probably isn't good for you at all...  This one will suds up a little... and it cleans very very well.  If you have dry skin. ring worm or fungus type skin issues. this will really help it.  Meanwhile. using it daily keeps most of that stuff at bay."
9,"First. let me tell you that I have not yet ordered the larger size bottle from Amazon. but sure will! I wanted to try it first by getting the smallest bottle from Kroger to see how I liked it.I started by filling up my hand soap dispensers and then showering with it and I really like it! My skin feels so light and clean and not dry at all.I have not shampooed with it (a little scared to although I don't know why?); nor have I cleaned with it yet. For cleaning. I only use a vinegar/water spray and I'm happy with that.The peppermint is invigorating and fun but a friend of mine tells me I might like some of the other fragrances better. I would love to try them all!Once I have tried other things. I might update my review to 5 stars but didn't think it was quite honest or fair to do so yet.You'll be glad you made the switch!"
9,"This is my first time going Organic and I was nervious. I used to use shampoos and conditioners that had ingredients unkown to me (SLS) and (SLES). I needed a shampoo and body wash that did not contain either ingredient. I bousght this product because it does not contain neither (SLS) and/or (SLES). This soap works very very very well with my hair. I do not even need an after shampoo conditioner. For me. this soap does both. It cleanses both the hair and scalp; and it conditions it. After letting my hair air dry. I can lightly brush it out with no problems. I like using the soap as a body wash. because of acne issues. I have seen less breakouts and my skin does not feel stripped. Very good product. However. the product arrived one day late; and I was not too happy with that. I hope in the future it will arrive on time. Thank you!"
9,"Bronner's doesn't have tooth-coating ingredients found in even 'healthy'  commercial toothpastes. But you say you -want- those? Actually cleaning teeth instead of supposedly protecting them allows your natural processes to rebuild enamel. There is still so much not known about all of the weird ingrediants in just about every other product. Perhaps the strange new feeling isn't 'nice'? You'll get used to it. and learn to love it. I use peppermint. as toothsoap and mouthwash.  and have found that it gives me a clean feeling no other product does. Perhaps what others find undesireable about Dr Bronner's is exactly what they really need.  I believe that it may be able to stop a cold before it starts. cleaning out germs and mucus in the mouth and throat in early stages of a possible cold. Some  interpret this as an uncomfortable sensation.  (it involves quite bit of spitting afterwards if the mucus is there). I've found no other product cleans as well clean"
9,"I've been using Dr. Bronner's for many decades. It's my favorite camping soap. but is a refreshing wash-up anywhere. I use it to freshen water bottles too. It gets rid of that funny plastic taste and smell. Larger quantities are cheaper than the smaller bottles you might find at your local mountainously overpriced sports stores. I gave it four stars because I do prefer the original formula that was stronger and left a size-able tingle on your skin. but even toned down it's a great soap. I'll continue to buy it."
9,"Dr. Bronner's Rose Castile Soap is really great stuff - while we haven't used it on our laundry for house cleaning purposes. we have used it for all sorts of personal care cleaning purposes. including to use to wash our hair. faces. and bodies.  I'm not a huge fan of using this soap as a shampoo. as it's difficult to find a good conditioner to match it's rosy scent. however. it's really nice to use as a face and body wash.  As a shampoo. it tends to dry out my hair a little too much. also.  As a face and body wash. I haven't noticed any effects of drying out my skin. and the scent is not strong enough to overpower. but strong enough so that when I get out of the shower that I am lightly rose scented.  The scent is not chemically or super girly smelling - my husband even likes using this soap!  Highly recommended."
9,"The soap smells nice. lathers up easily and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed. I am a firefighter and after being exposed to smoke from burning plastics etc the smell stays with you for a day or two. I use this soap and it seems to get rid of that nasty smokey feeling after the first shower. I have it in my locker at work and in my shower at home. I will probably never buy any other soap at this point. I like the tip from others about using a foaming dispenser...will try that for sure.I dinged it one star due to the preachy label. I peeled the label off as soon as I got it since it only has a few lines about the actual product and ingredients. all the rest is like scripture. If religion is your thing. good for you. but I don't need it in my face and I don't need a religious message on the stuff that I am paying for."
9,"I became a big fan of body wash when I realized how much more efficiently I can get through a shower.  I then decided I wanted to get something that was less perfume filled and would keep from feeling like I just bathed in my deodorant. Dr. Bronner's was an excellent choice. it doesn't dry my skin. it rinses clean and it's supposed to break down better. meaning it's better for the environment.  I also can get about 6 months out of the 32oz container. a little goes a very. very long way."
9,"This soap made me realize how much I like soap lather.  I never felt clean using this because it doesn't lather.  I would use some with a loofa. and I'd have to add more 2-3 a shower session.  I was going through way more of this than I would regular body wash!  I'm sure it was cleaning just fine. but I have oily skin and need the &#34;reassurance&#34; soap lather provides.Basically. if you have OCD like me you may want to avoid this soap."
9,"If you're like me you're reading these reviews to see whether or not you should buy the product. Buy it. I bought the 16oz bottle and it is worth your money. IT LASTS FOREVER. For $10 you get a really nice body wash that. if you don't like it. you can use on your dishes. There is no risk here. I bought the Tea Tree and I really like it as a body wash. though I can't attest to its other uses. I will say though. don't get the rose; i haven't personally tried it. but nobody in the world has given it a good review. here or otherwise."
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
9,"I discovered Dr. Bronner's soap pin my local food co-op when I was a student- more years ago than I care to admit. I can only echo what others say: It's the perfect all around hand soap. bath soap and dish soap. I buy it in gallon jugs. attach a pump (available at any good hardware store) and transfer it into quart containers for the bath. pint containers for travel. and hand dispensers for the bathroom and kitchen sink. A gallon lasts close to a year in my household- just remember. as the Doctor says: Dilute! Dilute! Dilute! ;-)"
9,"Perfect soap for me. It doesn't dry out my skin. its hypoallergenic. it is biodegradable so I can use it while backpacking. it has tons of freaky pseudo-cult stuff written all over it for shower time reading. what more could you want? No weird fragrances means that it is basically just castile soap mixed with peppermint oil. The peppermint oil can be a bit jarring on really cold winter mornings. but it is completely amazing after working out. When you are trying to cool down after a workout. the peppermint oil is so. so nice.Recommend for anyone who likes simple refreshing soap?"
9,"Our family loves all of the different scents of Dr. Bronner's soaps. They are truly an old fashioned type clean with no chemicals. that leaves skin feeling 'squeaky' clean.My only word of advice with this product is to not use it on baby's head. It gave my child cradle cap when she was little. and it took me a while to figure out why her scalp was so dry. When we quit using this on her head. the dry scalp went away. So this product can be a little drying if used on the head. Otherwise. these soaps are fantastic. and I highly recommend them!"
9,"My kids tend to be sensitive to ALL shampoos. soaps. laundry detergents.  No matter how 'Natural' of a product I find. someone gets a minor rash.  Also. my daughter has thick naturally curly hair. and I don't want to use harsh chemicals on her hair. but she doesn't need tangles!  THIS IS AMAZING.  No rash and makes her hair so soft!  Takes the tangles right out!  Plus it's great that it can be a body wash too.  Love the all in one option with kids.  I absolutely recommend this to parents for their kids.  Four years of searching and two kids- this is the one!"
9,"I bought my original liter of Dr. Bronner's from Trader Joes about a year ago and have never looked back. This stuff is fantastic! When I was buying it. the guy who ran my order said. 'I love this. got me to start taking shower's again.' There are tons of uses for the ultra-concentrated soap. I mainly use it as a body wash and handwash (diluted. of course). My fiancee has a chronic lung disease. and he says the sweet peppermint scent effectively eases the tension in his lungs. Dr. Bronner's is best when traveling. I fill up a 3oz container (about 1/2 water) and use it to wash my hair. body. and clothes. I have yet to use it as a toothpaste. but I heard it leaves a slight aftertaste. Great product!"
9,"Love this product. it always works as advertised. I bought a 32oz bottle on October 31st. it is now December 31st and I have used maybe half an inch of this soap. The upfront cost is expensive. but this stuff is very cost effective since a 32oz bottle will probably last me 1.5-2 years. I bought a 4oz one for travel (they didn't have the smaller one in stock) and I imagine it will work for many years to come. One problem is that I dropped my 32oz bottle while in the shower and it broke the top part of the cap off."
9,"I love this soap.  I have used it to wash the dog because it doesn't have a bunch of chemical junk in it (and he liked it).  I use it to wash my hair.  I use it as a body wash.  I am sure it could be used for other things. but those are my three main uses. and I love it for those.I enjoy the minty feeling all over. however. if you are using it below the waist. you should use it lightly and be prepared to rinse it immedietly in case the minty feeling starts to become too much.  I have never had any problems other than feeling like a big peppermint but others may react differently.One thing you should be mindful of is that this stuff could gradually slow rate of water drainage in the drains of the bathroom--it gradually builds up a little. even inside the bottle itself.  It is easily remedied with a home made or commercial drain unclogger."
9,"Been using this for years. A little goes a long way. and it gets you clean and minty. Makes your eyelids and. um. some other parts. tingle like mad. to the point of being nearly annoying. but it is a transient sensation. Don't get this stuff in your eyes while wearing contacts. burns like hell. But that is true of many soaps.  I use this stuff for both soap and shampoo. it is gentle enough for that. at least for a (non-metro) guy."
9,"I grew up with Dr. Bronner's Soap. Dr. Bronner's doesn't advertise. they don't need to. Not with the word of mouth they get from an growing number of fans and almost all of them will tell you. this is the good stuff.The label is fantastic of course. The soap is very refreshing. Unlike other reviewers I don't recommend it for shampoo though. I have hip length very straight hair and Dr. Bronner's makes my hair look dirty unless I follow it up with a vinegar rinse. and cold vinegar on a peppermint-y head while being very bracing isn't my favorite way to wake up.Other than that though. I've used this for laundry and for washing myself with and love the tingle.My husband was an Irish Spring user until I got him to try this. He exfoliates with a scrubbie and Dr. Bronner's and tingly clean has become his standard for clean. The scent is fantastic if you like peppermint."
9,"I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly. the label creeps me out a little bit. but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo. body wash. laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it."
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
9,"After discovering the possible dangers of traditional soap and shampoo. I was recommended Dr. Bronners by a co-worker. I received it without realizing you can basically use it for anything. not just shampoo and soap. I've used Dr. Bronners for shower soap and shampoo. for washing my hands. for shaving. and for even cleaning a sink. Rumor has it you can even use it for mouth wash and/or brushing your teeth. I am not 100% sure if that's true. but it is a rumor. Try at your own risk.The smell of Dr. Bonners is great and even though it's expensive for a small amount. it &#34;lathers&#34; really well. You only need a dab of this stuff to clean a wide area of whatever you are cleaning. It doesn't leave your hair/skin dry like traditional soap and shampoo can sometimes do. It makes you smell great for a while after using it. Highly recommended to traditional soap and/or shampoo."
9,"I've been using it for about 2 months and it works great. i love it for my hair. I have Thick Curly hair. my hair feels clean and i really enjoy the Tea Tree smell. I've used this soap to wash various types of vegetables. I've washed raw chicken with Dr. Bronner's Magic Pure-Castile Soap. i just let the produce or poultry soak for 3-5 minutes in a clean sink filled with water and a few squirts of Dr. Bronner's soap. pat dry and the Tea Tree smell will go away when its dry. over all fantastic soap i will be buying lots more! and Recommending to people i know  . and i also recommend getting a shower filter so u can get the full benefit from this Organic Soap!"
9,"This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing. I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen. and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount. much less than I have to dispense with Dawn."
9,"I have been using nothing but Dr. Bronner's Soaps for about 4 years.  I love how real these things smell.  Also. I can get behind a company that recently supported the bill in California to require all GMO products to be labeled as such.  This 16 oz bottle of soap will last me for months.  I sometimes will even handwash articles of clothing in it.  And the lavender fragrance is authentic.  If you were to take a sprig of lavender and rub it between your palms. the smell would be the same as this soap.This soap does not have any moisturizers though and can leave the skin a bit dry especially if not thoroughly rinsed.  I have not notice much of an issue expect for the times I have washed my face in the sink and not rinsed enough.  My skin felt pretty tight without moisturizing."
9,"This is the only soap I use (with occasional excursions into pine tar soap. for specific uses... See my reviews on pine tar soap)I love the peppermint especially for the tingle and zing you get from using it!I use it as bodywash. shampoo. and to do dishes with.I've never experienced the drying effects when others complain of when using it on my hair either.Don't know if it's due to others not using it right or freak body chemistry on my part. Either way. I am a proud Dr. Bronners user!"
9,"I purchased this ball in the 55 cm size (red).  This size seems ideal for my height (just shy of 5'5'). although choice of ball size is also a matter of personal preference.  Unlike my previous ball. which was made of a thin. sticky vinyl. this ball is made of thick durable. smooth plastic.  Furthermore. my previous ball lost air easily (I had to add air to it every time I used it). whereas I have NEVER had to add air to this ball since I purchased it almost two years ago.  It is definitely worth the investment to pay a little more for a ball that is high quality and will never any maintenance. and so I highly recommend this product."
9,"I've used Thera-Band balls at the place where I got physical therapy and I know they are great quality. The issue I had was that the ball I received did not come with an adapter that would allow me to inflate it with a bicycle pump. nor did it come with a plug. So basically it was unusable. as you can't inflate it without a plug to stop the air from exiting once it's inflated. Also. if you don't get an adapter for a bicycle pump. you will need some sort of pump that can fit into the hole of this ball to inflate it.As much as I love the brand. I would recommend a different ball that comes as a kit with a hand pump. plug. etc. I ended up getting a GAIAM ball and have been very pleased."
9,"My 8 yr old son loves his scooter again.  The rear wheel on his original scooter was so worn out from using the brake that it was making a noise every time he used it.  I decided it was time to replace his wheels.These wheels worked great and come with their own bearings (so you do not have to reuse the old bearings).  I believe the bearings are rated ABEC 5 (though I cannot be 100% certain).  ABEC 5 are what are found on most skateboards and scooters in the US.  Some models from China are rated ABEC 3 which are to be avoided.  These wheels roll about the same as the original razor wheels. which is why I'm inclined to believe they are ABEC 5.  Overall. I am very satisfied with these new wheels."
9,"I have 1500 miles on this rack so far. and I load it down pretty heavily with four bikes.  I love this rack. especially for the money.  With this. I feel confident taking our bikes on nearly every road trip we take.  The straps are starting to show some wear. so I try my best to be careful so they'll last as long as possible.  I see getting another 1500 miles before running into trouble.  I use this on a 2000 Toyota Sienna. and it looks like it was made for it.  It's a challenge to get four bikes to fit on there (at first). There is a learning curve. but once you figure out how to arrange the pedals and which direction to face the handle bars. you can load the bikes pretty quickly.  Just experiment until they fit just right. Yes. you'll look out your rear view mirror for the first 20 miles. but worry not.  Those bikes aren't going anywhere."
9,"Since this seems to be a big deal for some people. let me fill you in. I have a Masters of Fine Art. I teach color theory. The topic matters to me more than most. With that in mind. camping gear has yet to be something you can color coordinate. And actually. that's not a big deal. Maybe if you camp in your back yard?When I'm out in the woods. I'm not looking at my site. much less the interior of my tent to see if it's aesthetically pleasing. Seriously? There's nothing sexy about the deuce gear I lugged around in the Marines. However. the fact that I'm still around tells you that it worked pretty dang well.Focus on what matters."
9,"We took a pair of these out camping this past weekend. Two twin air mattresses do not fit in our tent. so I would take my ultra light back thermarest and was too thin.  So I got this and tried it out on our living room floor.  Worked great. so I got my wife one.  Its comfortable and doesnt take up a bunch of room.The downside is the valve makes it tough to use pumps.  You basically have to either jimmy rig your pump or blow it up manually.. also deflating takes longer than most other sleeping pads."
9,"Haven't went camping yet. but have tried it out on the living room floor. The flaw I see in this product is the air valve. You have to squeeze it while inflating or deflating. Makes the two processes more difficult than they need to be. Took 7-10 mins to blow it up. but took just as long or longer to deflate it to pack it away.Air valve aside. it's a good product. I'm 6' 270lbs and the mattress supported me well. Was reasonably comfortable to lay on. Material seems tough enough to hold up to regular use. Overall. good product for the price.EDIT: Just took the thing camping. worked great. Didn't lose any air over night. was comfortable to sleep on. Worth the money."
9,"Got it on sale a month ago! Upon first arrival i thought the valve was blocked but it was actually a pinch and inflate valve. So like some other reviewers i punctured the valve opening a tad more to be able to blow air faster into this thing. So far so good a 4d Battery pump will blow this up fast. But I opt to save the weight and blow this thing up by mouth taking 3-5 breath breaks inbetween. For the price it's a much better alternative and far more rugged then the photos do it justice. Don't waste money on a big agnes or any expensive brand enless you NEED a pad thats 1 pounds or lighter. This will suffice for the extra pound or two it is compared to a minimalist pad. hope this review helps some people and helps you pull the trigger. No problems with loss of air. A truely amazing deal."
9,"I have been so sick of failed air mattresses that deflate or get the mystery holes. and you spend a lot of money on them.  I decided to try these.  I bought three of them. one for myself and my two kids. This is much more comfortable to me as when I shared a mattress with my kids I would be the one squishing it down. as I weigh much more than them. and waking up with my hips on the ground; which really killed my back!  These mattresses can be a pain to air up and deflate. but with the use of a pump both of those processes are much easier."
9,"I purchased 3 of these before a 4 day camping trip in North Idaho. I've always been on the lookout for alternatives to the traditional large blow up air mattresses that most people use while camping. which I have always found uncomfortable. unreliable. and a pain In the ass. These little mattresses worked great. The wife and kids loved them. They slept comfortably for 4 nights. The mattresses did not go flat or lose air. For the price. I would totally recommend these for camping. The only gripe I have is that they take awhile to inflate. Make sure you have a pump. because blowing these up with lung power could be a big chore.If you're thinking about buying this for backpacking. don't bother. They are bulky and heavy when deflated."
9,"Hands down the best air mattress I have ever used! All summer all over the country I have used this thing often relying souly on it to do the job and it performs flawless! I hope they keep the quality up. good to have a few of these things in the house or camping gear. I am 6'2&#34; and about 165 and works perfect. My hip bones don't touch the ground at all and hold nearly all it's air throughout the camping week. It's heavy not for backpacking but that's why I like it. Beach trips. people visiting. car camping. and fitting into small tents. I even accidentally laid this thing out on too of small cactus and barns in the outer banks and it never popped!"
9,"I have not had this mattress out yet but did blow it up and take it down to see how long it would take me and how hard it was.It only took a few minutes to blow it up by mouth and a little longer to take it down.  You do have to hold the valve open whendeflating this mat but for me that is not a deal breaker.  I am going on a kayak trip and I wanted something a little more thanjust a thermal rest because I want to have a little extra padding when sleeping on the ground and this seems like it will work for me."
9,"Bought this air mattress for camping out with the kids. Used it a couple times. with several different size people (child to large adult). everyone seemed to find it comfortable.  I like the fabric surface. still want to try it with only a blanket underneath and cover.  I have difficulty lying in one spot. this is an issue for this mattress. as it's not wide enough to roll over. etc.  Overall. I found the mattress a good value.Pros:PriceSurface material (not all vinyl)Length is very good. I'm 5' 10&#34;. plenty of room leftCan handle a heavy person (230 lb) without hitting groundCons:Width - which is obvious from looking at it online"
9,"This little guy is one of the best frisbee designs ever. The Superdisc is easily the best frisbee to play catch with your friends. the rubber ring around makes it easy to throw and catch (Well. you have to get used to the extra grip when throwing it. people tend to hold on to it too long and it angles in the direction their arm moves).It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well. you can do long. straight throws with it.And as a bonus. the rubber prevents people from getting seriously hurt when hit (it still hurts though!)"
9,"This really is the ultimate frisbee... it has the power/flight capability similar to an Aerobie. but is dead easy to throw. You can even try and throw it wrong and it levels itself out in flight and goes nice and straight.The rubberized grip/edges make it really comfortable to catch/throw and is about 100x better than solid plastic frisbees and a HECK of a lot easier to play around with than a real Aerobie with folks that don't want to have to learn a lot of technique.If you like parks. stop reading this review and just buy one and keep it in your car. It is awesome."
9,"I have used lots of traditional and not-so traditional frisbees and this is the best yet.It is just the right weight and size. flexes nicely during catches and flies very. very far.It also slices through strong winds really well and doesnt seem to 'Float' as much as other disks; so goes where you want it.My children. 5 and 7. have finally learned how to throw and catch because this is easier to throw and catching it doesnt hurt their hands.I recommend this product."
9,"I found the Aerobie at our campsite. It have to say. it was a prize! What a wonderful flying disk. I'm not very good a Frisbee. and I never would have bought this. but my daughter and I were throwing it around and it's nearly impossible to throw incorrectly. It will always fly -- sometimes. too far (I don't know my own strength). It makes me want to go to a big park and see just how far it will go. My daughter is seven and she can throw it just as well as I can. Yes. this is much better than a Frisbee -- easy to throw. easy to catch.  I'm bringing this to all my outdoor functions."
9,"I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw. This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro.The only problem I had was that this disc broke within the first day of throwing from normal recreational use. Maybe there was a defect already in the disc but I was very disappointed with its lifespan.It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually."
9,"I have a philosophy about my new commuting experience that can be summed up as visibility trumps cool.  If you are rich or if you are seriously touring at night (I guess folks do that) go drop a couple of hundred on a fancy light.  Essentially. this will do.  The Bell light makes light and flashes.  I am more concerned with people seeing me at dusk or dawn than I am lighting up the road.  It is fairly cheap construction. but it shouldn't take a lot of pounding riding back and forth to work.  The light is inexpensive and it works.  If you are concerned with batteries and the environment. buy a generator light... or at least rechargeable batteries for this one."
9,"Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo(Whereas my front light was gray in hue.unlike the black/gray one you see here)thinking it was a good buy.wrong!This product is as shoddy as most 'BEll products' are.The rear light went out first.then the front light shorted out after a minor drop.Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i've learned not to trust the viability of 'Bell products' ever again.That's why i'm now a 'Cateye's' and 'Nite Ize' product fan.Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost."
9,"This worked well enough for its first weekend camping. but it was definitely getting soft after a couple nights.  I guess I've already got a small leak. somewhere.The valve doesn't quite fit snugly with our Coleman-brand air pump. so it requires at least two hands to inflate (we've got an older quick-bed. its valve fits perfectly).It's so big. it barely fits through the door of our tent.  Somebody else mentioned the 'trampoline' effect of an air mattress this big. and it's true:  if one person lifts himself to roll over and then plops back down. then the other 'trampolines' into the air.  Only two very sound sleepers can sleep together on this thing.  Maybe we should've gotten two twin-sized airmattresses...And the 'Wrap'n'Roll' system is just a gimmick.  Don't pay extra for it.Ben"
9,"Bought two for the fam. used once. didn't hold air for more than a few hours then had only about half. which is where it stayed. and that was before ever. ever put any weight on them. in the middle of the day. And yes. I double-checked the plug. Also removed all rocks from the sandy tent pad. used a quality tent tarp underneath a quality tent. as well. though since hadn't put any weight on either of them when they lost the air that shouldn't have mattered anyway.Did I love the carrying bags? Oh yeah. Also loved the nice new (to me) plug system which made blowing it up and sealing quickly while still full of air very easy. Too bad the part that really matters - holding air - was so immensely inadequate. Returned them immediately after returning from camping trip. now have to go find something else after having shopped for this till thought would drop...'thanks' Coleman...arrgghh."
9,"I bought this mattress about 6 weeks ago. to replace an older model of Coleman Queen-Sized air mattress that lasted 2 years. before it started to leak.Within a week. this mattress developed a slow leak - had to pump it up about once a week - I thought. Well. that's not too much trouble. but it certainly doesn't match the quality of the older model.Then. a few days ago. it developed more (or a larger) leak(s) - now. it deflates in about 4 hours - pitiful. Someone said it came with patches - mine didn't.I suggest you buy something else - I am going to - don't know which one yet.Buyer beware - the quality has went spiraling down. faster than the leak *__*"
9,"The pump works fine. Filled the bed in about a minute. But if I need another (or a replacement) I'd get one that works on household AC power.  This needs 4 D cells.  Since I expect to use it only occasionally. the batteries might be dead by then.Of course. running on batteries is better during a power outage ... but. come to think of it. I don't need any power to sleep in my bed. (Just to get up. some mornings.)Since I've only used it once. I can't attest to relaibility."
9,"The Coleman 4 D Battery Quick Pump takes 4 D-size batteries which will give you loads of time to blow up a mattress but the darn thing is loud and sounds like the bearings are bad.  Right out of the box this thing sounded like it was going to burn up or seize.  The volume of air expelled is fine for blowing up a bed but I would not recommend that it be used to blow up a raft.  The unit just doesn't have the pressure/power to even do a bicycle tire although it is not intended for that purpose."
9,"Yes D batteries can be expensive. but my name brand batteries seem to last a long time. Plus the ability to take it anywhere is a BIG plus. My pump works just great on the 4 in 1 Coleman mattress. Inflated both in under 2 minutes. Deflation even faster. Remember. sometimes you get a dud. try again. I got lucky and got a great pump at a great price. I have tried those aero type beds. and not for me. Uncomfortable. heavy. must have a plug near by to inflate. I'm spur of the moment. so this travel pump is just perfect! p.s. it's advertised as a 4D pump. so you know before you buy it takes D batteries. so if you don't want the weight by a bike pump!!"
9,"Very very powerful. It blows all kinds of air products in just a minute. I cut one star because it is just too much noisy. Maybe in that powerful mode it can't be lower noise. Anyway it is embarrassing if your air mattress leaks during midnight. It will wake up a few friends. let alone your family on the mattress.The battery lasts very long. It brings another side effect of heavier overall weight to other products.But I still recommend this to you. Never buy those 4 x D battery pumps."
9,"I have a Coleman mattress and for years I was trying to get by using the cheapo pumps. They worked. but I had to hold them on my mattress just right. otherwise they would just blow everywhere. This one. on the other hand. fits right into the mattress and inflates in the blink of an eye. hands-free. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a tie or something with which to attach the nozzles to the pump. to avoid losing them. I wound up using one of the twist ties that came in the box. but come on; there has to be a better solution."
9,"This pump is likely fine for Coleman beds. but I bought it for the 'fits other brands and items'.Sadly.  every airbed manufacturer seems to design their own. custom fill-vent.  The Coleman was a full .5' too small (diameter) to work with my Simmons and wouldn't fit my Aerobed either.The battery is a lead one. and not light.  The quickpump running without a bed attached also seemed to be twice as noisy versus the 120V plug-in charger for the Simmons bed-- very much not quiet.For my purposes. and because of the noise level. Not Recommended.  Coleman bed owners who don't mind the noise may be ok."
9,"Can't say too much besides the fact it's a handy pump. It is slightly bulky compared to other pumps but that's not really a big deal. Part of what you get with a rechargeable battery that is actually decent. I actually bought this almost a year ago now when I went camping with my girlfriend. only charged it that one time. After we got back from camping it has just been sitting on my shelf. I haven't used it since and I just went to check and see if it still has any juice left before I started writing this review. It turned on like I just unplugged it from charging."
9,"I brought a pair of aqua sphere goggles and they work great. they did not fog up like the rest of the goggles do and the seal works great and stay seal so it does not leak. I have brought other pairs of goggles from speedos to tyr and they all leak and fog up even when they say its anti fog and they do not seal well around my face. I aways buy aqua spheres now and no other brands of goggles. they are also easy to ajust. I would highly recamend these goggles to anyone they are great."
9,"We live on the beach in Italy for a good part of the summer each year. and the kids spend all day in the water.  I know for me. nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles. so I'm sure it's the same for the kids.  If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product. adult or kids. you should.  I have never had a leak. never had fogging issues. and they are comfortable for extended wear.  I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years. and look forward to the same quality for the kids."
9,"I bought two (2) pair of this goggles (clear lens. cherry) nov. 2009 for my 3 and 5 years old daughters. from Amazon. at $16.56 each one.Don't doubt it: &iexcl;SPECTACULAR! goggles.ProThe frame is really flexible and comfortable for kids face.The ample visibility of the curved lens doesn't scare small kids. they don't feel claustrophobic.Watertight fit is GREAT: Just make sure that hair is out of the frame and I can assure that it doesn't leak.Strap is very easy to adjust. nice mechanism.Easy to put on: My daughters could do it alone after a few attempts.ConNot everlasting: After heavy use (3 - 4 times per week in the swimming pool) in hot weather (sun. etc) the frame material showed cracks until water leakage begun. End of the goggles. But they lasted 18 months (less than $1 per month = bargain for me).ok. enjoy. bye."
9,"Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide. comfortable. mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles. but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh. and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet. which is a small miracle."
9,"These are hands down the best kids goggles out there as they stay put on little faces.  The large coverage area also seems to give kids more security in the water and also leaves less chances of them falling off.  The material is tacky without being sticky. which is great for holding on to little kids in motion.  The many colors are also nice so that each kid can have their own color.  They aren't indestructible and the lens can scratch so a bit of care is a good idea. but as far as kids goggles go. this is a good investment to make."
9,"This knife is perfect for on your keychain carry. I went to a bbq this weekend and it was used multiple times for three different things. I had to pull it off my keychain because everyone needed a bottle opener for there beer. The scissors were used to open a capri sun that the straw was lost for a kid. And the knife was used to open a present. And when I told people it also has a pen they were shocked! awsome little knife just get it and put it on your keychain."
9,"We have three of these. one for each kid. They have been well used by all three children and have held up well to the use. They fold down to a very slim size that fits well under our seats or in our trunk. We have had them for some time and the children are able to fold them up and open them up without extra help from mom and dad (always a plus).The one negative that I have found is that if you get the lever that is used to lock the scooter open (or closed) at all dirty it will jam and not open or shut very easily. A quick clean will fix this. but it is something to watch for.A small adult can easily use this with no difficulties. If you are a heavier adult or tall. you might want to look for a sturdier scooter meant to hold adults.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
9,"Love the fact this scooter can fold for storage or when taking with us in the trunk of the car.  Though I think the clip you flip to fold this could be easier.  (My ten year old doesn't have the finger strength to push the clip down to fold it).  That's a little disappointing. but Razor's use of quality metal. foam and plastic more than makes up for this little annoyance.If you're in the market for a child's scooter - Razor is the best."
9,"Bought this scooter for my younger nephew in green and he really loves it so far. It's too small for adults like myself. but for kids 4-12 it really does the trick. It rides a little rough on the street. but it's great on freshly paved surfaces and side walks. Do note that the wheels are on the smaller side. so they feel every single bump and road imperfection. Small loose rocks can stop the scooter if driven over at the wrong angle. Definitely make sure you purchase a helmet and pads along with this scooter if you have inexperienced little ones.One issue I did not like about Amazon is the constant price changing they do. When I first added this scooter to my cart. it was priced at $25. then about a hour later. when I was nearing completion of my shopping. the price went up to $30. Be weary. and pay attention to the price listings."
9,"We love these scooters!!  My kids are almost 4 and 5. and we all have one!!  This one was for my husband--my daughter insisted he should have one to ride with us!!  It didn't take any time at all for them to get the hang of riding them!  We bought therex kids theirs when we were at Virginia Beach for a week (3 and 4 at the time.) By the end of the week. they had it down pretty well!  We often take these for short trips instead of dragging the bicycles around!  They are compact. and a lot of fun!  Just wonderful!  I am also not a tiny person--I am 160 pounds. and my husband is 190. so they do a good job standing up to our weight!"
9,"Since the Razor originally came out. there have been many other types of scooters competing for our attention: 3-wheel. 4-wheel. and larger wheel scooters -can- fairly be called improvements. but the Razor is still all that most of us need. for  short trips a bit faster than walking. Sure. you can't fit two feet side by side on it. it doesn't have suspension of any kind. and the small wheels get hung up on sidewalk seams. but it gets you where you're going three times as fast. (it really -does- roll smoothly). it's -very- compact. and -very- inexpensive. Unless you plan on spending -many- hours a week on your scooter.(in which case a couple hundred dollars may be a fair expense for the big-wheel advantages). I recommend a Razor ."
9,"I needed 3 of these for my boys. and of course they had to have their favourite colour.  These scooters arrived at my Post office in less than a week at a overseas military address.  Scooters were exactly as described.  Adjustable height for the handle bars.  Capable of folding up to a relatively small size for stowage. or travel.  Why the 4 stars as opposed to 5?  This is because the handle bar shaft fits somewhat loosely in the neck of the scooter.  I would expect it to be of a tighter fit. Every Razor scooter I have ever seen or handled demonstrated this looseness in the neck.  Other than that they are great!"
9,"My son loves this scooter and I have fun riding it. too. He rides it to the bus stop every morning. Under his 60 pounds it just glides along. It's a bit slower for me. but I have a great time taking it home. anyway. My husband is over the weight limit. so he just folds it up. The folding and unfolding is easy enough for our son to do. tooI will be buying more as the rest of my family - friends kids get to 3-4yrs of age. as the scooters are so durable/adjustable for age and height. that none will be passed down. only worn out over time.and the price is very reasonable with amazon prime!"
9,"Bought the pink one for dd so she could have a scooter like her brothers.She gets around on that thing too fast i think lol.What can i say it is a Razor they are the best. We have a few other brands and they are not as easy to close up and store as the Razors are.Great scooter and super way for them to get good exercise and just enjoy being a kid! Too bad i never had one growing up oh wait that is ok because honestly i use theirs sometimes lol!"
9,"My 5. but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a 'princess' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink.  The 'sweet pea' scooter is PINK.  But it is a nice. soft pink.  All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender.  It's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters.  I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever.  And it came totally assembled in the box.  I didn't have to touch a tool.  All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place.  Even the pink pom poms were attached. These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far: Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model (for me!).So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard. this scooter will be perfect for her."
9,"For kids who aren't old enough to handle a skateboard. but still want to be out rolling along with the neighborhood kids. this is your answer.  The `Razor A Kick Scooter' is perfect for those 5 and older.  Made of aircraft-grade aluminum. with 4' heavy-duty urethane wheels. adjustable comfortable handlebars. and a patented rear fender brake. this little scooter will make any youngster mobile and happy.  It comes in several colors and folds up into a six-pound storable package.  Scooters are almost an American tradition and kids love the feel of freedom when playing around the neighborhood or playground."
9,"After my neighbor went and got one. my 4 yo begged for one.  I figured it would be good exercise. so I got her one.  It didn't take her long to figure it out.  My son. who is nervous about balancing on two wheels. saw my daughter having so much fun. he tried it out and they both fought over it.  So. I had to go out and buy one the same day.  Okay. I didn't have to. but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid.  I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds.  The wheels glide smoothly.  I am impressed with the quality."
9,"This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter (age 6 1/2).  This scooter is built like a tank!  The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever.  The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade.  This scooter can easily be handed down (might need wheel replacements from normal use).It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category.  I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare.  I will warn you though. this scooter is not as light (in weight) as you would think.  I was a little surprised.  However. the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight."
9,"Today I bought the second of this scooter. The first I had bought last summer and was great. It's seen a lot of use. and a fully grown adult has put it through its paces without issue.Tonight I bought another one. and it's going back to the store immediately. The problem with it is that the handlebar tube is jammed and very stiff. There's no way a child could adjust this. since I estimate I had to apply well over 100 lbs of force with my foot against the foot area while pulling very strongly against the handle bars to get even 10&#34; of extension. I'm unable to pull it out further. The handlebar is just hopelessly jammed into the tube. so back to the store it goes.Too bad. as the rest of it continues to seem fairly bulky and lots of shiny metal everywhere."
9,"I bought these scooters for my children about 6 years ago. They ride them regularly and have put a lot of wear and tear on them. Not to mention leaving them outside in the rain and weather often.  These have held up and have been well worth the 19.99 I got them for (on sale on Black Friday).  My son is asking for a new one. only for asthetics since his has rust and the handle bar grips are breaking down from use.  It still rolls and works fine. I think I will indulge this Christmas and buy another and keep this around for friends.He actually rides this more than his bike.  He is 10 years old.  My daughter. 11 still hops on hers too.Easily folds for quick storage."
9,"I purchased 2 units. one blue and one red.  My kids love riding them.The quality of the scooter is very good considering its price.  The handle bar is easy to adjust with no tools.Kids can easily collapse and fold the handle by themselves for storage.The ride seems fairly smooth for them even over concrete sidewalks. although they prefer to ride on asphalt park trails.The rear fender brake works well.The good thing is they go about as fast as an adult jogging. so they can tag along when I go out for a quick run.I own a Xootr for myself. and compared to that unit these are toys. but for sub$40 what can one expect?  :)"
9,"Ordered this recently for a party. This new film printed pictures that were obviously brighter and clearer than the first cartridge of over-year-old film we had opened and used first that night.  I almost ordered a whole bunch to set aside. but now I'm glad I didn't because the difference in quality makes it clear that fresher film produces better pictures.  From now on I plan to order what I need even though the more you order the cheaper it is per picture.  Everyone has so much fun with these pictures - there's something about a tangible print that digital can't compete with.  Highly recommend this product and hope they never stop making it!"
9,"Item does what it advertises - cushions your rear from hard seats.  However. I've had mines about a month now. and it's already beginning to get 'compacted' or flat.  It's no longer as soft as it originally was. and it now starts to get uncomfortable after about an hour or so.  But it's still not as bad as the seat without it.I use it on average twice a week for about 1.5 hours at a time.Also. unlike some of the other reviews here. thankfully it has not (as yet??) split and the gel start to leak out.  It also is a bit wider at the back than most bike seats. so it sometimes slides about and goes off center slightly. even if you tighten the drawstrings as much as you could.Bottom line - it'll give your rear end some comfort. but if I could do it again I'll probably try for a comfy seat instead first."
9,"I thought I could get away with my standard seat on the new bicycle I got.  It seemed pretty comfortable on my quick ride around the neighborhood.  But after I installed this. I rode 4x around the neighborhood without feeling a thing.  It doesn't seem like it would do much when you put it on. but I have to say it has made my ride feel like air.  It feels like I am just riding on my peddles and frame.  I can't recommend the gel seat enough.  This one fit my bike very well and for a great price.  Highly recommend it!"
9,"I had a little trouble getting this saddle cover to fit tightly. it took some effort to get the ties real taught and to cross tie them under the seat.  It worked pretty well for a while. but then over time it felt like the gel was breaking up and then I left the bike in the sun and the gel started to melt an ooze out of the material.  That was it. it was ruined.  It lasted one season of riding.  Felt good when it worked.  It did the job of getting me acclimated to my bike seat.  After a good season of riding i didn't need it any more. the standard saddle is fine."
9,"I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well. and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is. after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15. I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear."
9,"I did a search on Amazon for bicycle seat cover. I saw the picture for this and the price and it looked perfect. Unfortunately. I scanned the reviews too quickly. What I thought I read was that it was a bit too tight so I was thinking this would be perfect for a road bike. But in reality it apparently is perfect for a STATIONARY bike. One of those with the huge seat on it. For a bicycle this thing is too big. at least for standard seats.I rated it for the quality and price which is good. The description is misleading."
9,"I bought it not for softening my saddle. The fact is I have a Selle SRL Titanium saddle in red color and I wanted something to use as a cover to preserve this expensive saddle during I transport my bikes or when I have to ride in very muddy conditions. So I bought this product purely as a 'cover' and I didn't make much research on this item. supposing that 'any will fit'First of all. I was very unpleasantly surprised by the weight of this product. It is unreasonably heavy. very heavy. It is made very big just to be more universal and fit more saddles. but its not the best idea. If you apply it on narrow saddle. than you cant fix this cover at all. It moves and slips all the time. Fixing strand is another bad idea. In fact. I can't find any positive point in this product thus I can't recommend it. Don't waste your money!"
9,"I'm a pain to please..I work and go to school and study and a mother..OMG..omg..I have no time do nothing..I found time to workout on my weekends....and at first when I ordered I was over my head..so I got my man to fix it..The instructions we're bad..but he figured it out..I had this for 3yrs and I'm in good shape and workout 2 times a week for 60 mins..I do crossrunning and sking on the gazelle...its fun because it teaches me to balance myself and My waist used to be a 26 and now a 23...I'm very little now...But..I have been on a no carbs and no dairy diet..so that is why too.lol..the calorie counter that came with it did not work and it sucked..so I got a new one and replaced it."
9,"We've had this stove for upwards of 25 years. and it has withstood the test of time. weather. and all kinds of camping conditions. The stove has accompanied us on camping outings in Alaska. Canada's wild lakes (for canoe and kayak camping) and on our average family summer camping vacations.It is lightweight. sturdy and a great way to prepare hot cakes. eggs and coffee in the morning.For larger families. there are of course larger Coleman stoves. But for a family of two to four. this item is perfect."
9,"It is convenient and packs up well for car camping.  The stove gets very hot. and is great for boiling water.The stove does not do 'simmer' particularly well.  Be careful with anything that needs lower heat settings.  Using a cast iron pan or high quality aluminum or copper clad pan helps.  Attempting pancakes. eggs or a side dish requires very close attention.I would say that overall this is a good value. but there are better units available.It does have good wind resistance to it. which is a definite plus outside."
9,"I've camped with this Coleman stove for two years. It has never failed me. I'd be lost without it.Compact. Rugged. Throws out lots of heat. Boils water and cooks food quickly and efficiently. Wind shields actually work.The hose that connects the propane canister to the stove unscrews and fits nicely inside the stove during storage. Connecting and disconnecting the propane tank is a breeze. Simply twist on a propane tank and you're ready to cook. No pumping. priming. or filling a tank with flammable liquid.This is the best little camping stove ever made. I won't go camping without it.***UPDATE*** 4/1/2012. I'm still using the same stove for camping. Never had a problem with it."
9,"This Coleman stove has two 10.000 BTU burners that have independently adjustable flames that let you simultaneously boil water (on HIGH) or simmer (on LOW) whatever it is you desire. You can hook in a single propane cylinder tank that gives you 45 to 60 minutes on HIGH depending on your atmospheric conditions. This is a Coleman PerfectFlow stove that allows regulation of the propane pressure so some use and experimentation will get you desired results. It is a small unit. but it is very versatile and well-crafted. This Coleman stove has adjustable sides that allow for larger cookware and/or use to control temperature. Matches or such are needed to ignite the propane fueled flame. The bottom line on this unit is that it can really throw out heat and it is easily regulated."
9,"As long as you don't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit.  You see. the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings.  No problem if you're trying to warm a kettle of water. a bigger problem if you're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast.  My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one). and it worked great.  You're on the right track. but keep looking...stay with propane. but away from this model.  I've seen others comment with this same concern. so it is a quality control/product issue.  C'mon Coleman...build it US. build it right."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
9,"Hey guys. I camp and hunt a lot with many friends. My job is to cook for hungery people and the stove has worked great for that.  I use the fitting for re-filling the little 1pound tanks. off bulk tanks.  1LB will last a long time. many cooks.  I took one star away becasue some of the sheet metel is getting cought in the lid. so when I try to open it. I need to find something to pry it open. The second thing is it can be hard to turn the burner on low. it junps back to middle heat when I take my hand off the knob. but it will do it. I just have to try several times.  All in all a great stove! I'd buy it again!!!"
9,"I have owned three of these stoves over the years.  i gave the first two to my kids and ordered this model.  The windscreens are cheaply. made. fall off the stove which then doesnt  support the rear screen.  Once closed it required a hunting knife to open because the inner deck stuck to the lid.  The right burner worked fine but the left burner flamed inefficiently.I feel this stove is a piece of junk and Coleman ought to feel ashamed of the sheet metal worksmanship on it."
9,"The 6 piece set was more than I actuallly needed. but I didn't know where I was going to mount the speed bag and so I got the whole kit.  The speed bag is really good quality and the swivel is better than I thought it was going to be.  It is nice to have both the wrap and the gloves if you are a beginner because you may find that one suits you better than the other.  I did not end up using the platform but the frame leads me to believe that it is very sturdy.  The jump rope. ah. the jump rope is a nice touch and it is nice to have. but i's nothing special.If you are looking for a fun and challenging arm workout the speed bag is a lot of fun to learn. It is not about punching something as hard as you can it is about controlling your punch.  I like it. it's fun and it's a really good outlet on very bad days."
9,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions. I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED.  I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing.  Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating.  The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating.  For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.  For more advanced boxers. spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight.  Wraps are not flexible and too short.  Bag gloves are unnecessary."
9,"My 16 year old son is interested in boxing so I thought this might be a nice starter kit for him to practice with.  The boxing gloves aren't that great. but they serve their purpose.  The bag and platform are fine....I had enough sense to know it wouldn't come with screws and stuff. so we bought what we needed before installing it.  Found a strong beam in the wall in the garage and it was up and ready to go in 20 minutes.  He really enjoys using it (as does my husband) and so far. it appears to be of decent quality and perfect for what we wanted - a home speed bag set that wouldn't break the bank. but wouldn't break during use either."
9,"this is a great kit to get all the items you need for a speed bag set. there is one bad thing about this set. but there is an easy fix. the swivel shown in the picture is NOT the one included in set. the one included in set is a cheap plastic base. with a plastic ball bearing. and a small metal i hook glued into the bearing. with a small spring clip attached to hang tour bag on. of course that wasn't going to fly so i upgraded to the Everlast Professional Speedbag Swivel and it made things great. the next thing after you get good at it is to upgrade to a smaller bag. the bag included is way to big. after you upgrade these two things its a great set and well worth the money."
9,"I purchased the Everlast 2'x6' Folding Mat primarily for use with theStretch-Out Strap. and it works great for my purpose.  The mat is well constructed and very thick-- I am quite comfortable in all my stretch positions.  I do not stress the mat much. so I cannot speak to its ability to handle 'abuse'. however. it seems very sturdy and the handle straps are sewn quite securely. If you need to transport your mat. I would think it might be nice to have some elastic loops or something to keep the mat closed-- I don't move mine so that is not a concern for me."
9,"We're using these to lay over our hardwood floors so the baby can play and crawl safely without fear of bumping her head!  You know. sometimes babies will &#34;faceplant&#34; as they learn to crawl or even fall as they learn to stand.  Our only carpet is limited to smaller rooms. but a few of these unfolded and laid next to each other provide plenty of room for her to play while offering great protection!  Best of all they fold up and store under the couch and the handles really help to move them around easily.Cheap and functional (though our purposes didn't include adult exercise!) and actually a bit nostalgic (reminds me of gym class)!"
9,"I gotta say that I felt like I was rolling the dice on this. because I was not sure if it would be firm enough.  It is soft. but also firm. but not as firm as the commercial type blue mats used for things like gymnastics.  Really that is OK though since for a exercise and stretching mat it does not need to be that firm. and this mat is a good balance.  I think the quality is OK and there was only the faintest of odor up close which is not a minus. just an observation.  The size is also good. I doubt many people would need something bigger."
9,"This mat is a good size and although some reviewers have mentioned it's lack of width. I don't find any problem with that for the exercises I do on it.  The thickness is plenty good enough to protect me from the hard floor. yet supportive enough for my back.  The vinyl is very easy to wipe clean.  One of the best things I like about this mat is the fact it folds in half and has neat carry handles.  I have a small home gym so just pull it out when I need it then wipe down and fold it up and prop it up against a wall when it's not in use.  The color is great too.  Compared to the much thinner mats I was using when I had gym membership. I think this is an excellent purchase.  Seems pretty sturdy though I have only been using it for a couple of months so difficult to tell how it will stand up over time."
9,"Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over. I'd buy the yoga mat."
9,"This is a great mat for the price. Enough cushion for floor exercise. easy to clean and carry. The one drawback is the fluffy nature of the foam. It isn't dense foam. So despite its thickness. it bottoms out pretty easily. making this a good mat for soft and slow moves. but wholly inadequate for anything that might involve impact. I used this for my prenatal yoga floor work and loved the cushy support for my aching hips and back. Overall. better than a typical extra thick yoga mat. but don't expect yoga mat density/quality."
9,"When we take this to the park. then all these children want to play with it.  Funny. but it actually gets annoying. because as a parent. I have to hold other people's kids to keep them safe while they are jumping up and down.  PLUS. my kids don't get to use it as much because of the other children.  There is a weight limit on this pogo stick. so be careful with heavier children.  Other than that. it's easy to use. and even to store.  Barely takes up any space and even stands on it own with the base.  Make sure that you stay with your child until he/she gets really good with it."
9,"My daughter had been in desperate need of a basketball for her outdoor hoop. so we decided to give this one a try. The surface has a good. slightly textured feel that was a little bit tacky. which made for a nice contrast to the cheaper rubber basketball she'd previously been using. which had been worn nearly smooth.We've had the basketball for some time. and it's survived nicely in our garage over the course of the change of seasons. Unlike a lot of the other sports balls we have. this one holds air well. It has a good bounce. and the surface is still in good shape after all this time. Being bounced against the cement on our driveway hasn't left it any worse for the wear. I can't say how it might function in an actual court. but it's a good choice for some outdoor basketball."
9,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good. affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the 'tack' on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- . could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ . Holds air wellFeel - B+. more tacky than other basketballs. but feels greatBounce - B. GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- . I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors. recommended."
9,"This Spalding Tack Basketball is very tacky. It makes it easy to palm the ball and provides a light soft touch. Using the ball mainly on indoor courts. it holds up well. I'm doutbful that the texture could withstand a lot of use on an outdoor court. but after a few uses outside. it is still in perfect condition.I like this ball a lot. but I only gave it 4 stars. because I noticed that whenever we pick the 'game ball' for our pickup games. everyone shies away from these balls."
9,"The main feature of this ball is a tacky surface that makes the ball easier to grip.  This feature works really well.  This ball has a noticeably better grip than the Wilson indoor/outdoor ball that I have been using for casual driveway basketball.  Otherwise. it is a typical indoor/outdoor ball.  It is well made and keeps inflated.  One interesting fact about this tacky ball is that when wet it becomes much slicker than a standard ball. which grips about the same when playing on a wet driveway."
9,"This ball provides grip and feel for ball handlers and shooters with a composite cover material.  I have 2 boys that lllooovvvvee basketball and this ball is their favorite.  This ball emulates the feel of leather. that also offers the durability need for mixed surface use. It seems like they had ball handlers and shooters in mind when making this ball.  The ball has a wide channel design. suitable for indoors or outdoors use. the ball meets official NBA size and weight requirements.  Can really speak on the durablilty but for the most part. we are really impressed with this ball.  Buy it. you'll love it!"
9,"This is an excellent basketball for both outdoor and indoor use. although it will keep its grip much longer if used only indoors.The super grip gives the ball handler excellent control when making cuts and crossovers plus it is much easier to palm!This goes for pretty much every basketball but remember to bring your ball in to your garage or a shaded area after playing. Otherwise. the ball will start to split at the seams if left out in the sun.This ball would have gotten the coveted 5 star rating but the price is a little high compared to similar balls out there. They need to knock $5 off the price. Otherwise. it does the job and the grip is awesome."
9,"My son is a basketball fanatic.  And at 15. in just a year and a half of playing seriously (pickup games. etc.) he has become quite the fanatic.  He already had 3 previous balls he plays with.  But when he saw this one he said 'yep. that's pro quality' with a long smile.  The grip is so good. the response is up there also.  If you want to bring a smile to your players face you can't go wrong."
9,"This is a fairly nice basketball.plenty of tact creates a good grip and the size seems to work well for all of us. As a family we have played with this basketball at the court club we belong too (indoors) and so far so good. The tact is still just fine although if and when that changes I will update my review. We have used this basketball everyday since we've gotten it and its still as inflated as the day I got it.I will also mention that the ball doesn't have much protection inside its shipping box so I recommend using caution when opening the box so you don't end up slicing the ball.This particular basketball  overall seems to be a great value based on the selling price.  I would recommend this ball for beginners and intermediate players alike!"
9,"My son is the Swen Nater of elementary school basketball players. a great defender. good rebounder. makes his short shots. not much offense.  This ball is a 'tack soft' basketball. a shooter's ball. with a good finger grip.Of course. when I tried it. all my shots went in.  Let's face it. at age 53 I can still shoot.  Heck. I tried a ten pound medicine ball and made three straight 3-pointers.  But my son liked the feel. and enjoyed shooting. and seems to make more shots.Seriously. this is a gym rat's ball. not a street rat's ball. and it does give a good feel for a shooter.Heck. I could make a watermelon from 20 feet 11 out of 9 times.  So don't judge by me.  But this is a great shooting and good feeling basketball."
9,"This is a good quality indoor-outdoor basketball.  The texture is soft and very easy to grip when new. with deep seams allowing excellent ball control.  Regulation size (29.5).  Being soft. it's not Spalding's most durable outdoor ball--the Street model may be more durable if you play outdoors all the time. and the tack on this one does wear off after a couple of dozen hours on cement.  Indoors. it'll last forever and stay nice and grippy. It needed a little air when I received it. but otherwise. I'm totally satisfied with it.  (Although not a big deal. I also happen to like the rich leather-like color more than the brighter orange of some balls.)"
9,"I'm still feeling out the grip of this ball and what I think about it.  Change can be hard. and I sometimes want to stick with the traditional grip.  However I have to admit that it is nice to be able to grip the ball better.  I also need to evaluate how well this ball will handle usage.  I play mostly outside which can cause more wear and tear on the ball than indoor courts.  This is probably the most important factor for me. and I'll try to come back and edit my review over time.  I am also still evaluating how the ball behaves around the rim.  So far I haven't seen too much difference in that regard -- I'm trying not to blame the ball for my misses.  :)  The ball has kept its air well note.  I'd say that if you are on the fence with this ball. just go ahead and drop the few dollars and try it out yourself."
9,"I ordered this 29.5' basketball with the only intention of playing with my young son. Having said that. I was not too worried about getting a more professional ball.For starters I could not play with it out of the package as it did not have enough air in it. so we had to wait until I could have it inflated (unfortunately I do not have the needed tools at home) The ball looks really cool. it is light and has a nice grip.We have had it for a little over a week and we like it so far. again. I am not playing professionally or anything like that. it is a basket ball I am using to teach my young son how to play so. works great for me!"
9,"Great basketball if you are using indoors.  It was packaged well and needed a bit of air to get going.  We have been using it on a asphalt driveway for about 2 weeks now and it is showing wear.I have no doubt that it will last for a long time to come. but it will lose its grip and eventually have to be replaced.  That being said it is an excellent quality ball with very deep seems and a perfect gripping surface.4/5 stars for us - my only real complaint is that it is priced quite high.  It would also be nice if they could rate the ball for indoor or outdoor with some specifics so that a buyer knew what to expect after regular use."
9,"This is a wonderful ball.  I know because we bought the first one over a year ago for my son's birthday.  We bought one similar maybe the exact one before but he didn't write his name on it and it never came back home after a practice.  It has a nice 'sticky' grip. feels secure when grasp. and for preparing to shoot. It holds air well and doesn't need to be re-inflated except maybe check it at the start of the season.  Has a nice vibrant feel to the bounce and is all that you'd expect in a quality ball.  I highly recommend it to all. It even arrives inflated for immediate play."
9,"I swim at the local gym 1-2 times a week. Found this pair of googles with great reviews and a decent price so I pulled the trigger. I have been wearing these goggles for over 6-months now and am very happy with them. The goggles are comfortable around the eyes and the strap stays on in a secure and comfy fashion. I bought my gf a pair as well and she uses them several times a week with no complaints. If you are looking for a comfy pair of goggles to use for recreational swimming that come with a decent price tag then you should look no further!"
9,"I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear. keep the water out completely. do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones). and do not hurt at all."
9,"The last time I bought swimming goggles was probably 1992. so I was a bit leery of these goggles at their relatively low price point. They fit great. and they don't leak much at all. I exert myself pretty hard when I swim (i.e.. I am out of shape). and they don't seem to fog up very badly. Every now and then I need to de-fog them. but mostly they're great. They stay in place. they don't leak. and they're adjustable. I particularly like that adjusting them is not particularly easy to do -- yes. I like that it's hard to adjust the length. because that makes the length very stable and secure. They're good goggles. particularly if it's been 20+ years since you've bought goggles."
9,"UPDATE:  Initially gave this 5 stars because of good function.  But after only 9 months. the rubber that seals the goggles against the eyes is cracking and brittle.  I din't expect them to last forever but less than a year is still disappointing.  They have been used fairly heavily I would say.  END OF UPDATE.  Sometimes I hesitate to buy something because it seems too cheap.  These aren't going to last forever but what they do well is keep water out of your eyes and they have flat lenses so your view isn't distorted like with some goggles.  We'll see how long they last."
9,"I like the Speedo Hydrospex Swim Goggles. They have a snug. relatively comfortable (for googles) fit and won't leak if you follow the instructions on the package. These Speedos look good in the water and provide decent visibility. I find the tinted versions too dark to see underwater.  I have used these clear goggles for a year now. and after about 30 uses.  there are no durability issues so far. These are nice goggles at an affordable price. better than the cheap ones I had as a kid that leaked all the time!"
9,"I purchased the clear model before and I loved it. I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these. Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool. They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right.  They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad. The fit around the eyes is very comfortable. Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away."
9,"Speedo makes great goggles with great quality.  I usually buy a pair every year or two to replace older ones that I have scratched up and or stretched out...yes I have a big head.  :-)That said I figure I would try a pair of these.  True to form. they are perfect goggles and very high quality.  Not much else can be said.I rate them 5/5 but with a hint of CAUTION!If you are ok with wearing what seems like a pair of sunglasses under water..then these are for you.  They do in fact block sunlight and make the experience a bit better during the bright mid afternoon but they do darken things up quite a bit  Just a note....in the end its your choice."
9,"I have a lot of ocean miles with these goggles and LOVE them. I always say it's the best 20 bucks I ever spent. [ and I have spent it happily several times because I keep giving them away or loosing them. SO this is a really good price.]  If you are used to the glued on foam seal goggles you should buy these immediately and throw all your old pairs away. You should go to the Speedo store and try on the various models to see what floats your face though. [ I think the other review is about the Speedo Jr. Hydrospecs.] Further these goggles are GOOD to about 20 feet and seldom leak.GO OUT AND SWIM IN SOME BIG WAVES  TREVERYONE wants  T R Caspellmr. Toads wild ride.  Todd Royall CaspellRIDE LOTS  Tord and sundry(expressed opinions not necessarily ofmy brain)"
9,"I have an older one and I have to agree with the flaws cited by other reviewers.  The hard plastic wheels are slippery. make an annoying grinding sound. and they ride rough.  The handle is way too short.  I have to hunch over to hold it.  Other less significant problems: the foot rest is too narrow so my 1 year old just drags his feet (2 year old can peddle or push with his feet fine).  The best thing about it is the low seat height (1 year old can climb on easily. not so with Radio Flyer).  It's also not expensive like the otherwise much better-made Kettler.  Between this and the Radio Flyer. we're set until it's time for real bicycles.  Trikes do tip.  I think that's how boys get tough. no?  or at least more careful."
9,"I am buying our third one for our third child.  This is a 'must have' for our kids between 18 months and 2 years.  The one we bought seven years ago is still going. albiet with a limp.  They have been used so much that the tires do wear out but the kids don't care!  The six and seven year olds still love their trikes as much as they do their two wheelers and they don't seem to notice that the wheels aren't round anymore.  Name one other toy you can buy for 25 bucks that lasts a kid from toddlerhood to first grade!"
9,"I got this for my two year old.  He already has a rocking horse (which he loves!). so I didn't bother with the rocking mode of this trike.  I set it up as pictured - as a trike with the tall handle.  My little guy loves it. and rides it all around the house.  The only trouble is that even with the seat ALL the way forward. he can still only reach one pedal at a time.  When we get better weather. we'll try it outside.  My biggest concern with using it as a parent-pushed. riding toy. is that I'm not sure he'll keep his feet on the footrest -- I'm afraid he'll get a foot under it. and get his ankle twisted or jammed underneath.  But. I guess we'll find out when spring comes!"
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
9,"This is the first trike that we bought for our eldest child. We also tried the metal Schwinn tricycle. but preferred this one. It is easy for the kids to get moving and has a handy handle to help steer the kids. I am 5'11' and this height of the handle is a bit low. but not unbearable - I would have preferred 1-2' taller. My wife (5') likes the height. The wheels are supper noisy and a bit annoying but the kids don't seem to notice. I should point out that shorter kids may have difficulty pushing the pedals. My son had difficulty when he was 33' or 34' tall and had no difficulty by the time he reached 35' or 36'.The trike has held up well. we have had it for about 2/2.5 years and it gets used several times a week (during good weather). We keep it outside and it power washes clean with no problems."
9,"I got this thermos as a christmas present (2012) and decided to try it out to see how long it held hot water.  I placed boiling water in the thermos at 11am and it was STILL boiling hot at Midnight.  Yes it is made in China. but I have not had any problems with the lid.  Just make sure you don't screw the cap on too tightly and you should be fine.  You don't even have to completely remove the cap either since it has slots for pouring liquid.  One reason it kept the water hot so long.  If you put soup in it that has veggies in it. then you would need to remove the entire cap.  The only drawback is that the Lid that acts as a cup holds less than one cup.  Other than that it is a great product.  No glass inside to break either which is a plus too."
9,"I have owned a Stanley thermos for years and they were built like a tank and made in the USA. I picked one up a few days ago and was shocked at how light and flimsy it is. While it may look like the old American made Stanley. it is just a veneer of it's old self and absolute Chinese junk not built to last.I am so disappointed to see once great American companies succumb to the economic pressure of building junk. I would rather they go out of business than ruin their good reputation. Don't waste your money as the companies soul died some time ago."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"I bought my first Stanley thermos years ago. It was made in the U.S. and of great quality. I left it in Texas with my grandmother when I moved. I bought a new one up here. Made in China and you can tell. It's not as heavy as my old one. There is a visible weld seam in the China version on the inside. It does NOT stay hot or cold like it claims. My old one lasted about 18 hours in the winter with coffee. Still steaming. This one...about 10. Disappointed. but I knew better than to buy things made in China. Stanley. I thought you had a lifetime customer here. but you dropped the ball. For what I need. the thermos will work. For $30. I expected quality. Not impressed at all"
9,"I've had one of these for a number of years now and finally got around to ordering another one so my wife and I could both use one at the same time.They're great in winter when you don't want a cold soda can making your hand cold and great in summer at keeping your soda colder for longer.The bottom is rubber and does a great job of staying put.There's no sweating/condensation to worry about either.I really think these things are great and can't see not using them going forward but avoided giving it a 5 star rating only because of how expensive they are.I feel like you should get a two pack for the price one cost."
9,"I can't stress enough how well these thermos koozies work. I own a can-am Maverick UTV and the cup holders in that thing will boil your drink in 5 minutes. Using these koozies I can set a drink in the cup holder inside this koozie and it will keep it nice and cold for a long time. Well worth the money! The only problem I had was that the bottom plastic piece fell off when I dropped it about 6 ' onto concrete. I just put some epoxy on it and it is as good as new."
9,"This thing can keep a beer cold in the heat for hours. Seriously. It's that good. it's expensive. but if you like cold beer. invest in one. Especially if you're the type of person who doesn't finish the bottom of the beer can when it gets warm from taking too long to drink. This will solve that problem. I also noticed that since my beer stays cold so much longer. I don't find myself drinking as much. This keeps me from getting too..... well you know."
9,"We bought two of these on a spur of the moment whim at a office supply store several years ago. We use them at work and home. but sometimes we forget and leave them. I am ordering two more so that we have one everywhere.  They are simply amazing at keeping a soda cold. They are strong stainless steel. There is a small plastic disk on the bottom that has came off of mine the last time I drooped it. The rubber around the top slips off for easy cleaning. For all the abuse it has taken it has held up well. This can insulator will ad class to your can of soda unlike the foam things."
9,"I was bored and trolling Amazon and saw this...it looked like fun so I ordered it. I read the assembly directions. which said you need 3 people. but a woman said in her review that she assembled her trampoline alone...props to her cause I tried and nothing...absolutely no movement whatsoever. I took it to work and 3 guys assembled it very easily. but used their combined strength to make the pieces go together and open. The smell is obnoxious. which I hope will dissipate over time. All in all a fun purchase."
9,"Four arcs are joined to form the rim. Good: has 5 legs. elastic bands instead of metal springs. quiet bouncing. affordable. the size is suitable for kids. and indoor use. Bad: the joints in the rim could be more rigid. the rim changes shape. making the legs point in odd inward and outward directions. The legs have some risk of caving in. hence my recommendation is for kids only. A single person can assemble the trampoline. but once going past 120 degre angle towards 180 degree. there is no turning back. you have to finish the job in one sitting. or the rim will forcefully whack you in the face if you try to bail out. I doubt there is any safe way to disassemble this product."
9,"If you want a mini-trampoline. I can recommend this one. It is built like a battleship. but assembly is non-trivial -- you need at least two adults (the instructions recommend three) to fight against the tension to pop everything in place. No big deal. but you are not going to put this together by yourself -- you can hurt yourself if something pops back due to the high tensions involved. The instruction book could use larger and clearer pictures. The legs screw on. and one of the legs in mine was slightly out-of-round. making for some stiff turning. but I got it on. There is an 800 number to call the manufacturer for any problems. I didn't need to call. We like this mini-trampoline."
9,"I have put these together before.  It's hard. but not awful.The instructions literally say that this job requires three strong adult.  THREE.  Do you have any idea how often there are three strong adults in my house at the same time?  Almost never.  So. needless to say. it's still sitting on my couch waiting for a few strong adults to show up.My husband and I worked on this for over an hour.  We got two pieces together. and finally gave up.THEN. the smell is overwhelming.  I'm pretty sure whatever they made it with is highly flammable and could possibly burst into flames by it'self at any minute.  It does say &#34;Keep away from open flame&#34;.  But. I think this is more like &#34;Do not light a match while this is in the room&#34;."
9,"it only took two of us to get it together. The first time it was warped after we put it together so we took it apart and did it again. On the second try it was fine. Not sure what the issue was. Went together pretty easily....smells something fierce of gasoline which is annoying. It's really just the blue rubber/plastic/foam that goes around the edge that stinks. The entire room where the trampoline is smells of it....hopefully it will be gone in a few more days as it off gasses. Kids don't rebound as high as they did on their kids trampoline but that's okay."
9,"The only issue is if it's moved. I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch. since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it. and so do it! Its a great leg workout. We're all happy for the purchase!"
9,"This trampoline was really cheap by comparison so I'm not going to hold it to a high standard.  A great thing about it is how quiet it is compared to my old one due to it using nylon/elastic bands around the frame instead of springs.  This alone gives it at least three stars in my view.  Assembly wasn't too bad either.My main problem with it is the size.  It is advertised as being 38 inches and that is simply not the case.  The interior dimension of the surface on which you would jump is 31 1/2 inches in diameter.  Even the exterior dimension is less than 38 inches (not that it matters.  Who the heck really cares about the outer size when shopping for one of these?  Lame.Because it is so small I would hardly recommend it. but for the price if you are careful to remain centered then it is passable."
9,"The assembly was relatively easy.  It does however stink to high-heaven until you air it out.  We left it outside overnight. and by the next morning one side had a rust stain on the blue cover.  I don't know how that happened. but oh well.  My daughter likes it. and does use it frequently.  It is a bit small. so you must put it somewhere with at least 3 feet perimeter for safety.  I still recommend it despite the horrible smell."
9,"The 38' size is a good deal for the price and works okay.  I did manage to put it together all by my lonesome instead of the 3 people the directions say are needed.  But... The chemical odor from the blue stretch cover is AWFUL.  I am going to stick this thing outside to see if that helps air it out.  If not. the cover is coming off.  It is too strong to use right now and that is why the 3 stars.  Nothing made for living creatures should smell that horrible.  I refuse to use it further until the smell is gone.I'd love to hear if others have had this issue."
9,"I was worried that assembling would have been hard after seeing other reviews. I had my dad and brother help. turned out not needed. one helper would have been enough. as long as you take your time. and make sure the person opening the trampoline up is strong and does not let go untill you get the bolts started. recomend assembling on a flat hard surface. and before you put in the only 2 bolts that holds the frame together. make sure the two ends are seated flat together.so far with my two 55lb kids jumping on it no problems.would buy again"
9,"I purchased this originally to use in my home gym.  I wish I could say that that is what it is used mostly for. but I can't.  This is the perfect size to have in a home gym or to be used by toddlers and small children.  I'd be careful if using it for toddlers since it doesn't have a hold bar or a net.  If you use it on a carpeted area or grass. as I do. you probably won't have a problem.  It is also very durable.  I have a toddler and a preschooler.  They use it more then I do and It has survived for almost 2 years unscathed."
9,"These pads are made nicely. I like how you can put on the pads without having to slide them up the limb. This helps if you already have the rollerblade on.The sizing is way too big for my 3 year old. The elbow pads barely fit my child's knees.The main drawback of this set is that it is missing wrist guards which I think are extremely important. The most likely fracture point is the wrists.Overall. I prefer theRollerblade Pro Junior In-Line Protective 3 Packwhich are smaller in size and come complete with wrist guards."
9,"After reading the other reviews. I thought these would work perfectly for my 4 and 5 year old children.  I was wrong!  They are huge!  They kept falling down. and the kids weren't the least bit interested in wearing them. and they are truly very safety conscious.  After realizing they were way too big for them. I tried them on. and they fit me!  They are really nice knee pads. but definitely not for little kids.  The elbow pads could probably work for knee pads for them. if you don't care about elbow pads.  I wish I had only bought one pair instead of two.  I will say they are priced well. though. as long as they fit!"
9,"I complained when I saw only 2 pads but upon closer look. they were not the same size. So doing some actually thinking. I took the package apart and lo and behold. there were 4 nested in two pairs. They are small but should fit up to a typical 12 year old. Quality is only OK. but a good deal for the price. They are not real comfortable as I would have expected with gel pads. but fit is OK. I suspect they will chafe with long wear. but I expect they will be fine for my requirements."
9,"Unless you are an adult the size and weight of an average 10 year old girl. don't buy these for yourself.  Luckily. I have a kid who can use them since they were too small for me.  However. they are well constructed and she seems very comfortable wearing them for several hours at a time.  They haven't been tested in an actual scootering fall yet. but by looking at them I am fairly certain they can take quite a hit and keep elbows and kneecaps from serious impact damage.  At least I hope so.  Also they are very cool to look at being deep black with orange buttons."
9,"These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself. I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid's sized. but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing. The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight. and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically. The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads...except that they are even tighter than the knee pads; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off...I'll probably never use the elbow pads again. The knee pads at least do an 'okay' job at protecting my knees (so long as they stay on) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents. I'll never be buying these again. nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children....(in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them.)"
9,"Any chain can be cut. but it takes bolt cutters. something the average bike thief doesn't normally carry. Bike thiefs do carry cable cutters: very affordable. easy to use. fit in your pocket and easily work on 90% of the anti-theft devices.This chain is well made and not so heavy it is like carrying around an anchor. completely defeating the benefit of having a light weight bicycle. Otherwise why not get a cheap beater bike no one would steal and a cheap cable lock thief's wouldn't bother to cut? Overall this configuration would weigh less and far less would be at risk.The price on this lock is unbelievably low compared to the competition. but it is real."
9,"I purchased one a couple of years ago the the wires got tangled a coupld of months back. The wire broke and there is no way to fix it. I bought these that are identical to the old one because I like the scan feature. the large numbers in the panel and the small size. It works well. If I can say something back is that the mounting only allows a handle bar position and it does not sit very tight on the base. My handle bar is not very large and even being small it takes space there. I also have my headlights in there and of course those have to be a the front. Sometimes. it will stop measuring if you touch it forward. It will not come off since there is a plastic stopper at the end but it will move out of the sensors and stop reading your ride. It has happened with me several times"
9,"I bought this only for the odometer function. I just wanted to know how far I was riding each day . I usually ride only two different routes that cannot be verified by driving my car over the same route. ( dedicated bike trails ). It is really not a bad unit for the price. I don't need something that will last for years. Once I know the distance of the routes I could just un-install it if I wanted to.. Ordered on a Wedesday A.M. and it arrived on Thurdsay P.M..It took about 10 minutes to install and off I went. Tested on a route @ Lake Perris Ca. and I was riding 12 miles( assumed it was 10 ) . So if you are looking to buy one. just do it. It is very inexpensive and will probably last a long time if you are careful with it .."
9,"This computer has been on my bike for almost 2.000 miles and it's still going strong. It seems to be very accurate. Just read the directions and you shouldn't have any problems. The only thing  I would recommend is measuring your tire yourself. rather than using the chart provided in the manual.Using the chart will get you in the ballpark. and for rides to the store and back it may be all you need. But if you're going to be doing longer rides and recording your trips. then it is well worth the extra effort of taking your time and doing your own measuring."
9,"I bought mine from a nearby Wal-Mart and it's worked perfectly so far.  Having never installed one before. I just took my time & had some extra zip ties ready...just in case.  The only tool you'll need is something to trim the ends off the zip ties when you're done.  I like the 'scan' mode which flips thru max speed. avg. speed. distance. total time. etc.  On the down side. I bought another for my son's bike.  It either had a bad sensor or a broken wire from the sensor to the unit.  It never did work.  I took it back for a refund.  For $10 - what do you expect?  You may get one that works fine - you may not."
9,"I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me.  Right out of the packaging. this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable. but it's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I'm riding on a layer of wood.Also. the product description says that it is designed for 'spin bikes' and doesn't say that it's made only for Schwinn spin bikes. so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike.  However. it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it. even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible.  This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs. which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I'll continue to use this since I can't return it since I've used it a few times. but I'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand."
9,"This would be a really good product if it fit the seat on my bike. After reading some of the other reviews. I had some doubt about purchasing this item. A lot of people were talking about outdoor bikes and spin bikes. and how the cover did not fit. I have a Schwinn Stationery bike. so I thought maybe it would fit because it was a different type of bike. Wrong answer. the width of the cover is not wide enough and the length is not long enough. I was very disappointed. I am just going to detach my seat and take it to a bike shop where I can purchase the right seat cover for it."
9,"I think Casio under prices this watch. I have purchased watches from Nike and some of the other expensive brands and this Casio is still my favorite. The low profile makes it wearable every day. It says it is water resistant. but I have gone to the lake and swimming with this watch and never had any water issues. The back light is not as bright as some other brands but I am glad it is not because this helps the battery last longer and it is bright enough to see it. The watch is very user friendly for first timers. You can not beat a watch like this. especially when it is a quarter of the price of other watches."
9,"Coleman stoves have always been easy to dent. scratch. get burned on and are not for the weak of spirit.  On the other hand. properly assembled and pumped up they heat far better than propane for much less in total fuel cost.  The white gas can be stored for years before using.  Over pumping the stove creates massive amounts of heat for extra big pots.  I have used big ones like this and the little portable ones.  It is easy to forget that metal parts do an excellent job of transferring heat so look out!  I have also used MSR stoves which could be dangerous. tempermental fireballs if not treated with respect.  By their nature camp stoves get stored a lot and used some.  These are the good ones."
9,"I've had 2 of these now because they're just too much fun. I kept one at home and one at work (I work with middle school students at a summer camp/program) and both broke but regardless I still love this thing. Mine at least have been pretty easy to aim as it is pretty consistent. It is a little tough to pull but shouldn't be a problem for anyone older than 8. In high school one of my teachers had one just to shoot students who were falling asleep. Pure fun for any age! I think their average life is about a year and then the &#34;bag&#34; starts to rip. Assembly was quick and easy. it's just a fun product."
9,"If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act. and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it. but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe. fun. easy to assemble. kids and adults will enjoy."
9,"The AirZooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The AirZooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own. but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)Recommended!"
9,"I've taken this to work. outside. to the beach etc.  I can't get enough of this thing!  When it starts getting boring I put it away for a week or two then shoot the dog with it.  Since he can't see it coming he things something just jumped in front or above him!  I even hit my mother in law several times and she had no idea the &#34;thump&#34; was what was causing her hair to jump!!!!!  This is even fun for my 4 year old. she can pull it back enough to get a nice air slug out even though she can't pull it back all the way and still aim.  Great fun!!!!!!!!!!"
9,"This Airzooka Air Gun is awesome!  This was a really cool Christmas present for both the 17 year old. and the 13 year old boy!  It was a really fun way for them to 'fight' each other. and have a war WITHOUT anyone or anything getting broken or injured.  Even the adults seem to love shooting it at each other.  But if you're worried about messing up your hair I wouldn't recommend getting shot.. It really does shoot a blast of air.. nothing to forceful.. but will mess up your do!"
9,"These Coleman lanterns are incredible values.  I've had this model for 20 years or more.  As a kid. my family had a similar model that is still going strong.  There isn't anything advanced about these; no electronics. no batteries.  They just work.  I have to replace the mantles about every 7-8 years. usually because I bumped the lantern too hard and one or both mantles broke.  At only a few dollars for two mantles. it's no big deal.You would need several high-powered LED lights to equal just one of these lanterns for light output.  On high. this will light up your entire camp site.I can't speak to the issues some have had where they say that their units appeared to be used.  As long as you get a new unit. you cannot go wrong with this lantern.  You'll be passing it on to your kids or grandkids."
9,"tips:1. the lantern burns brighter on white Coleman fuel2. gasoline is A LOT more dirty then Coleman fuel so try to pre-filter the gas before use.3.gasoline will gum up the lantern in storage VERY quickly.so dump out the gasoline after your use.4.if you burn gasoline a lot make sure to pack an extra generator(a lantern part)because they tend to plug up much quicker then with Coleman fuel. the generator is cleanable if soaked in parts cleaner or 'seafoam'.5. if you need 'directional light' cut a thick foil pie pan to the same dimensions as the globe.but make it only wrap half way around the globe(it will stay in place by being pinched between the shade and the mantel metal bottom. this will give you about 200 watts of directed light....perfect for Sasquatch hunting or signaling the mother-ship.that being said; these are great lanterns and simple enough to repair and pass down to your kids....a rare product characteristic nowadays."
9,"This full-sized lantern is a good choice for a shelter-in-place (SIP) scenario or campsite.  Backpackers or people walking to a bug out location (BOL) will probably want the much smaller/lighter eXponent lantern.This lantern lights easily and is quite bright.  I find the lighting holes acommodate the long grill lighters if you get the lighter angled up-down enought.  Remember that using Coleman fuel instead of unleaded will extend the life of the generator.  Use of unleaded exclusively may be a false economy. depending the price of (non-gasohol) unleaded and generators in your neck of the words.  Coleman fuel will also be considerably less stinky while running and particularly when starting and shutting off.The lantern does not come with a case but you can make one out of a pickle bucket.  Line the inside with larger bubblewrap to absorb shock.  There will be enough space inside for your long lighter. spare mantles. funnel/filler etc."
9,"I wrote some pretty scathing reviews on the dual fuel gas stoves. but I gotta tell you...this lantern is real nice.  It casts a nostalgic amber hue across the campsite. unlike the bright. in your face LEDs that are so common.  Keep the LEDs inside the tent. where they belong. this lamp is made to be outdoors and it is incredibly efficient.  We burned it for four hours each night for 2 nights and I still had almost half a tank of coleman fuel left.  Meanwhile. my neighbor was scrambling for D-cell batteries. LOL.  Is a bit unusual to prepare the mantles and light the fire in this day of point and click. but. take a moment and relish the (sometimes) greatness of simplicity...this product gets the job done.  This is what camping is all about..."
9,"It is an OK lantern that provides light at night. I did not try it out using unleaded gasoline. so I am going to assume it works OK using it (We used Coleman Fuel for it.) It is not too heavy to carry around. although it is way too heavy to hang on their very own Coleman Packaway Deluxe Camp Kitchen as the pole sways way too much. It was easy to setup and the included mantles worked great.The big issue on the one I received was that the adjustment knob was too sensitive to adjust the intensity to anything other than Off. Low. or High. There was no way to adjust it anywhere in between."
9,"We just used our Coleman two mantle dual fuel power house lantern on our last camping trip and we absolutely LOVED IT!! It was super bright. burned all night long with no problems and was so quiet.  I was thinking it was going to be loud and hiss like the lanterns I was used to having when we were kids camping.....nothing like those.  They were great too by the way but this one was the real deal.  I would recommend buying the case to bring and carry your lantern because the glass globe is fragile if not stored and carried properly.  The case that was recommended by Amazon for this lantern fit the lantern just right and was perfect for storing it in.  We packed all of our camping supplies in the back of our truck and no harm came to the lantern at all in the storage case!! I would highly recommend!!!"
9,"I have had a coleman lantern for years. back before they were dual fuel even.  I always burned dual fuel  or mogas as the army called it best add ons were a hard case. an amber  glass globe . and a spark starter so i didn't have to look for matches.  if you're careful you can get several uses out of the mantles but I always kept a few spares on hand in the bottom of the hard case.  These lanterns last forever with a little maintenance  mine was bought for me by my ex wife when we were first married I just wish our relationship had lasted as long as the lantern"
9,"First off let me say that this was the fastest shipping ever. period. And I just got the standard shipping.This knife is exactly what I wanted. While this is the most expensive SAK (Swiss Army Knife) I've ever bought. the quality is well in line with their other products. Blades are hair splitters right out of the box. the wood saw is just an accident waiting to happen. and the scissors and pliers are both tight. All this was expected.What I did not expect was the crispness of the cut on the file. While this file does appear to be the same steel as the other implements. in a pinch I have no doubt it will do some good work. The purchase of this knife has probably relegated my leatherman to permanent tool bench duty.Overall wonderful quality. fit. and polish."
9,"This is my third Victorinox Swiss Army knife.  (I lost the first and still have the second.  I only bought this because I wanted more tools).  These knives are incredibly durable.  I've never had one fail me.  With some imagination. the tools can be used for many more things than their intended purpose.  They are also much smaller and lighter than a Leatherman or similar tool. which makes them convenient to have on you at all times.  They're perfect for those moments when an unexpected need arises and you don't have full size tools with you."
9,"I've had experience with Victorinox Swiss Army knives for over 40 years.  My primary casual pocket knife has been the Swiss Army 'Mechanic' for over 20 of those years.  I've always been satisfied with the quality. and with the fine edge you can achieve with the Victorinox stainless steel.  This knife is no exception. Same fine quality.  A little large to comfortably carry in my pocket. but a problem easily remedied with the available Victorinox Cordura Belt Pouch for Swiss Army Knives. Two of the most useful features of this knife are the scissors and the pliers.  Of course you also have the available screwdrivers. as well as all the other features.  It's amazing how handy this knife has been.  There have been times. when I don't have the knife with me. that I find myself reaching for it to perform a certain task. and then. &#34;Drats. I wish I had it with me.&#34;"
9,"Everything I need for lighter home use. camping. hiking. glove box. etc. (Too big to be my EDC. I prefer the Super Tinker for that). I have both the Fieldmaster and the Huntsman. and the only difference is the phillips screwdriver vs the corkscrew. You cannot go wrong with a true Swiss Army knife as long as you pick a model that suits your needs.TIPS:-There's a tiny hole under the phillips opening to add your own straight pin.-The hook is useful for pulling tent loops and stakes. hooking things through loops.-Reamer is great for punching belt loops. creating holes. getting out shoelace knots.-Be very careful with the saw - it is the sharpest tool I've ever seen! Useful for cutting twigs for marshmellow/hotdog cooking sticks. cutting cardboard.Highly recommended!"
9,"My first pocket knife when I was growing up was a SAK explorer. you know the bulky model that had everything. and I love it. unfortunately when your young you are also more careless and of course I lost it. I was devestated. and since back then they were pricer my Dad would not fork over for a new one. undertandably. Well twentysome years later and I finally replaced my lost SAK. this time its the Fieldmaster. I love to camp and this model has all the tools I need without being too bulky and heavy. the quality is still great. the polished stainless steel is a thing of beauty and all and all a this is the quintessential pocket knife!."
9,"Needed a knife for my cub scout and after looking at the cub scout version of the swiss army knife decided on this one instead. Much better value. probably because it doesn't have to have the scout logo upcharge on it. Wanted a knife without a corkscrew on it (why bother for an 8 year old!) and this one fit the bill. He is delighted and I liked it so much I bought a second for my girl scout. Versatile and excellent quality. Not as heavy-duty as my leatherman but a great choice for a pocketnife."
9,"I picked this multitool because it has the best combination of features for me: I really like having a saw. phillips head and scissors. All of the tools are well designed. The saw cuts aggressively in both directions and all of the blades came paper slicing sharp and are easy to restore. It is also surprisingly lightweight for its size; unlike Leathermans which are also great but for different reasons. If I had any complaints it would be that some of the tools are slightly difficult to access (particularly the hook - which I don't use anyways) and I think that there is space for one more tool on the bottom."
9,"I bought this trailer for a trip up north. My husband filled the tires at home to the correct psi. Drove it around the driveway and everything worked great. We get to our destination and go to hook it up and the tubes are BLOWN. Actually shredded looking in spots. We were way up north and spent over an hour in the car to find a town big enough that had a store that sold bike supplies. Once both tubes were replaced the trailer worked great. Very easy to put together. I couldn't figure out how to attach it to the bike but that isn't my area. My husband had it attached in less then 2 minutes. The rubber on the original tube was very thin. I'm surprised more haven't blown."
9,"I was given one of these trailers by my son and daughter-in-law this past Christmas. Our grandson is now old enough so I took him for a little ride yesterday. he loved it!Yes. I'm sure you can spend a lot more money and get a better one. but this works just fine. Easy to put together. easy to attach to my bike (I attached it to an old mtn bike instead of my road bike)attaches very easy and seems very secure.Pulls easily enough and holds Will in place ... what more can you ask for for this price?"
9,"We got this to use as both a bike carrier and a double stroller.  Putting it together was SUPER EASY since it comes mostly assembled.  It is bit tight for 2 kids though. a 4 year old and 2 year old. Because the seat is not firm they tend to slide together and then fight because they are pushed up against each other. It attaches easily to a bike but be warned there is alot of drag almost like pulling a parachute.  I am guessing every carrier would have this issue though.  As a stoller it is very easy to manuever and push. There is some storage behind the seat and that adds to its convenience."
9,"[update 10/24/2008]  My daughter is now four - we still use the trailer for long rides and she still loves it.  The construction of the unit is decent and has held up well.----The trailer is really easy to set up - five minutes if you have a quick release for the back wheel of the host bike.  The ride is pleasant (meaning very smooth) for both the parent and child.  Like others have mentioned. the toddler loves their personal space.  Plenty of 'whees' when we coast down hills.I envision after my toddler out grows the trailer that I can use it for running errands.This is a non-brainer purchase."
9,"I've owned my XLT since shortly after it came out. and it is absolutely the best knife I've ever owned. even better than the SwissChamp I'd carried for 10 years prior.  I work as a computer tech. and this knife has about 90% of the tools I need to fix a computer. all in a (relatively) small package that I can carry in my pocket.  It's got things like Torx and Hex bits. and the bit driver is exactly the perfect size for tightening the little nuts on either side of a D-SUB connector (VGA. Parallel. Serial port. etc).  Even the little straight pin has come in handy for resetting PDAs.  I have used every single tool on this knife except the fish scaler.  Heck. even the toothpick has proven useful!"
9,"First I'm not a collector of Swiss Army Knives .  But bought this and am impressed with the quality of all the tools . It is well thought out and has most everything you would want for smaller jobs requireing a handy multitool. removing a splinter (first thing I used it for and it was nice to have) to sewing leather.  It is a bit large for pocket carry but could be in large pockets. I did get a belt case though . Although large I can use it and my hands are Medium to maybe large in size. but using two hands for somethings. most people could use it .  I have 4-5 multitools and probably 250 sheath. belt. pocket knives. etc. some custom made but this little tool has impressed me . If you collect Swiss Knives (tools) or want it for jobs requireing small tools I think you will like it . The price here is good too ."
9,"That is simply unacceptable! Granted it's not the most expensive unit out there but it should last more than a month.I did like it's size and it was fairly unobtrustive and not hard to program or read (that gives it the extra star)As for measuring steps it is not as accurate as I wanted anyway. When compared to the treadmill and elliptical machines. both of which give readouts of what you've done in your workout. this unit did not count all my steps. I wore it on the belt area/top of waist. It may be that mine was a dud and the battery was going from the beginning which is why the step count was off - but it really doesn't matter. I'm going to purchase a much better quality unit in the hopes it will last longer! I cannot possibly recommend this unit - although it does sound like others have had better experiences."
9,"I thought this had a heart monitor. SMALL Display. The Calorie Burnt Counter is Kcal vs regular calories. I ran on the treadmill and compared my Calories burned and Distance and it was VERY OFF!  Overall the pedometer said I only burned 83 kcal I ran for 30 mins and walked for 15 mins = 45 mins total in  which the treadmill stated I burned 400 Calories. You must also calculate the kcal according to your age. but my results did not come close to the treadmill measurements.  Dissapointed. I bought this because of the reviews on how accurate it is. But it's not. Have you compared it to something else? a bike or a treadmill?"
9,"For just counting steps while walking. this is a decent product. However. it is not totally accurate if you go running. Also. car rides can sometimes increase your step count is the road is a bit too bumpy.The setting for measuring distance is not accurate at all. but I don't really mind.The belt clip is sturdy. I haven't had any problems with it breaking or the pedometer falling off.Also. this pedometer is definitely purple. I'm not sure why they labeled it as 'blue' when it is without a doubt purple."
9,"This pedometer has a clock which resets the count every day and keeps a seven day history.  I just leave it on my belt and don't have to worry about resetting it or checking it right after a walk.  My wife has a pedometer with manual reset and she never remembers to use it.The sensitivity adjustment helps avoid false readings from car vibrations. and the aerobic steps feature is useful to determine how much exercise I'm actually getting.It is very durable.  I've worn it every day for over a year with no problems.  It also has a small enough size that I hardly notice when I'm wearing it.In summary. the combination of durability. features. size. and price makes the Omron HJ-105 an excellent choice."
9,"very loud very high pitch. pealess design. came with extra split ring. dont forget to get a lanyard as one is not incuded with this whistle. ordered mine in brite yellow for boating.update July5.2012: something interesting I wasnt aware. on the back of the fox 40 whistle package is an International Whistle Code. [one blast: 'where are you?'. two blasts: 'come to me.'. three blasts: 'I need help!'. if you hear any of these signals. respond with one blast. each blast should last 3 seconds.] I cut it from the package and have it in my tackle box. may be very helpful when im out on a lake in my boat as I bought this whistle for fishing. if of course any one within hearing distance also knows the code. I have another for bicycling in my CB hydration back pack."
9,"I compared this to a standard whistle (the ones with the &#34;pea&#34; inside).  This is louder. so in an emergency. this can be heard from farther away.  However. it takes a lot more air to blow it.  Therefore. if an emergency includes you being injured or weakened in some way. you might not get much sound out of it.My suggestion is to have one of these. but also have the traditional (easier to blow) whistle in your pack or emergency bag.  If you have the energy to blow this. do so. if you can only blow the other one. even though it isn't as loud. it may still save your life."
9,"there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I'm not gonna lie... I've tried a few of them to save a little money. but i ended up being very disappointed every time. then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it. it is such a great line of products. and very versatile. i use it for hunting. i use it for running. i use it at work. it's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour. it's going to be a solid product. keep up the great work."
9,"Aerobie rings are awesome as for distance. though you have to have good control.  Otherwise. you may find it leaves your neighborhood.It's good for kids when learning. because it will still fly if they flub the toss.They don't hold up to UV and weather really well.  A year in the backyard and the plastic is faded and brittle.  YMMV. but it should last a long time if you bring it in when you're done with it.Be advised that while the image shows a three-pack. you get only one.  They're a little pricey. but not too bad if you're expecting it."
9,"This thing GOES.We get our best results from a determined onslaught to bend the ring DOWN on both sides. like a taco.  Hold it in place for a minute. and then the ring gets great lift and is easier to aim.  The bent position lasts for hundreds of throws and catches and grass landings -- we just bend it that way once and then play with it for the day.This is great to keep in the car.  For my littlest son. we stand close together and just play catch back and forth -- he likes to catch it by popping his fist through the ring as it gets close.  For bigger kids. they have plenty of time to run into position for cathcing the disk -- this thing floats for a long time.Watch out for trees.  And I guarantee you it will sail out of a normal suburban yard. so watch for cars. too."
9,"The Aerobie Pro Ring is a fun disc.  It generally flies very straight and very true if you throw it correctly.  Throwing it correctly is not hard.It also flies FAR.  So. make sure you have ample room. such as a field.  We tried playing with one near our house on a 1 acre lot and it got stuck on the roof quickly.Later. I took my 10-14 year old kids to a football field to throw it. and we were regularly getting 50 yards on modestly powered throws.  An adult throwing the ring with full effort can easily achieve 70-100 yards of distance.Also. chasing the disc while it's flying towards you provides good exercise.This disc makes 'frisbees' fun again!  Buy one!  Find a field!  And. have fun!"
9,"We've had a great time as a family throwing this around the soccer fields.  Luckily we have a large park area with enough space for 4 soccer fields all together cause this thing really flies.  Its soft so that it doesn't hurt if one of the small ones misses their catch.  The hole in the middle provides a good way for someone to get a grip or to catch it ring toss style.  Light and easy to throw for all ages.  Get one of these. and get out for some family disc time.  You will be glad that you did."
9,"I was worried. even after reading positive reviews. that this was going to be some gimmicky product that wouldn't last. But I'm happy to report that those were unfounded fears. This thing is very easy to use. flies much farther than a frisbee ever has for me. offers a great deal more control. doesn't lose course as much due to wind resistance. is durable. and seems much safer than a frisbee. I say safer. because the covering of the ring itself is a very soft rubber. If you accidentally hit someone with a frisbee. there is danger of bruising. etc. But I don't see that happening here. Catching is never painful; even when your throwing partner exerts a little too much force. If there is bad to be found here. I simply have not spotted it. So purchase with confidence."
9,"This is the easiest disc to throw and it goes super far and I love it.  Further. I use it for playing with my Golden Retriever.  First it goes super far and when it runs out of steam it floats gently to the ground and my dog can easily grab it in flight.  While it's not designed for dogs it's made of  a material that's easy for them to catch.  If your dog is a super chewer this probably isn't the one for you; my guy does chew stuff up but only if I leave it with him.  He retrieves it and brings it back and gives it to me and we love using it.  I especially love how he flips it over his head so it's both in his mouth and around his head as he runs back with it!"
9,"I have used and collected a number of knives over the years. I have to admit I am Totally Brutal to my knives and I find out quick if a knife is well made or not.In my honest opinion My SOG knives especially my Flash II knife is a great knife to have!These knives are well made and well designed with a great life time guarantee. Not too many knife companies give you a lifetime gaurantee and shapening too! No other knife company besides Cold Steel will give you more Bang For The Buck !I've Never Ever had a problem with any of my SOG knives and I'm sure you will find the same true too."
9,"This SOG 'Flash II' pocket knife is an excellent 'every day' carry knife. While I personally prefer theGerber 22-47162 Fast Draw Spring Assisted Opening Stainless Steel Fine Edge Knife. my son did not due to the weight so we found someone that was willing to trade the SOG for the Gerber. Here are my observations:Pros:+ Quality; this is a well made knife that will hold up to daily use quite well+ Speed; opens one-handed quite quickly+ Blade; comes razor sharp and holds an edge quite well+ Pock Clip; very sturdy. no worries at+ Positive Locks; this locks open/closed with a sliding buttonMisc:* Weight; this a very light knife compared to my other pocketknives. I prefer a little more heft but (as noted above) my son doesn't. so this is a matter of personal preferenceAn all around good knife at a reasonable price!Highly Recommended!CFH"
9,"I have been using Myerco folding knives for a lot of  years now. but after using this knife for the last month of so. I have to say. it is every bit as good if not better than the Myerco Speedster.While the Myercos are easy to open with one had. the spring loaded blade in the SOG makes it even easier to open.Great knife. well made. You will not be disappointed.Also. the SOG has a metal pocket clip. while the Myerco is some kind of composite. I have broken one of the Myerco pocket clips but the SOG clip looks to be very strong."
9,"The action is everything I could ask for. It is actuated by nudging the thumb knobs on either side of blade and is truly easy opening w/either hand. And. this is just me. I don't see a need for the locking switch to keep the knife from opening in your pocket. although I do understand why one wouldn't want it to open there. Guess it's better to have & not need... I wish the handle material Zytel. could have been a little fatter. softer. to me. it feels a little harsh-sharp. especially on the 'finger' side. But I'll get over it. The blade is sharp out of the box. This is going to be a joy for EDC. It's going to be tough to find a knife to beat it."
9,"I really put this knife through the ringer. I tend to abuse my knives and let me tell you this one can put up with it. I wrote another review on this knife and said it was like a toy. I now retract that statement. This is a real knife. and it will hold up to just about anything you can do to it. SOG. keep 'em comin'... I will buy more SOG knives. By the way. this knife is made in the USA! Not all SOGs are. but all of the assisted opening ones are. I know because I called the company and they said this to me. I really don't think they would lie about something like that. Do you?"
9,"I find some of the top reviews extreamly question.There is no way this blade will handle cutting through a oil drum. it will not cut wire unless its very thin. I would be weary of really prying wit it. its a thin blade.I have the orignal seki Japan seal pup. And i know plenty of guys who have deployed with it.Its easy to sharpen. holds an edge. It will handle any lite to medium task you throw at it.The new nylon sheath is crap. get a kydex. The knife is affordble.  replaceable. And wont break the bank. Its a quialty knife but has its limitations."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
9,"I got it at wally for $40.00 so the price was ok (discounted). I like the blade design. it was sharp out of the package. but with a few passes with the lansky turn box and now its really sharp. The nylon sheath its ok dont have a problem with it. The balance is good but the handle its small. if it was a little bigger and more rubber like for better grip it would be better. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the handle. it is still a very good knife from a known brand. I will recommend it if the price is $40 or less and for  someone with smaller hands.Pros:sizeblade designCons:handleprice"
9,"Great knife.  Not sure about the mixed reviews on the sheath.  I optioned for the Nylon with a plastic insert (where the blade goes in).  Works great and feels like its built to last.The knife and blade are everything I was looking for.  Although it is a bit smaller that I thought it would be.  BUT I have no plans on returning it. just planning to pick up the full size version as well.I did shop around after deciding on this knife and by far Amazon has/had the best price"
9,"Love it love it  love it.I've been needing a camping knife for a while. I already owned several SOG products and have found them to be an acceptable balance of price and quality. This product is no exception. Are their better? Of course! But there are much worse for much more money. as well. THis is an excellent value for an excellent blade that I expect to last forever. Or.  until I give it away / lose it/ abuse it to disrepair. This buy is a no-brainer for anyone in the market for a similar sized blade.The only thing I may--- MAY - have changed. was going for the kydex rather than nylon.... but I do like that the extra storage in the nylon version is perfect for a sharpener or my SOG multitool."
9,"I was on the fence between this and a few others. but once I spoke with a couple real war veterans I was sold.  The blade arrived RAZOR sharp out of the box.  The grip is very comfortable and the weight is excellent.  It comes with a nylon sheath that works great. and has an extra pocket for a multi tool or possibly a magnesium striker.  The vet's I spoke with only retired their knives only after the grip wore out. which was after almost a decade of use.  Great Knife!"
9,"The Seal Pup is a great knife to have alongside your pistol. This rode next to my M9 on a Blackhawk Serpa and Omega holster. Held its edge. the grip was good if you were not wearing gloves and is made cutting chores easy. The 4 star rating is because the sheath was a bit cheap. Chunks got torn out of it. The blade finish also wears off. I ended up engraving mine a bit so it didn't look like everyone else's knife. Everyone seemed to be carrying these since they were cheap and sold locally. I would suggest these were serial numbered so you could at least ID yours from another one. Great buy and if you don't have a need for an M9 bayonet. this could be your fixed blade for travel and deployments."
9,"This is a lot of knife for under $50.  The blade is thick and feels very strong.  The blade comes extremely sharp right out of the box.  I gently ran it on my arm and all the hair fell right off!  The handle is a little small and for those with large hands. it may be too small but I didn't have any problems with it.  The nylon sheath is very nice and has a plastic insert inside for the blade so that the blade won't cut the nylon sheath when inserting or removing.  The blade is made in Taiwan...  I felt I made a good purchase!"
9,"...but I love having quality gear. I don't use this knife to fix tanks or fight for our country- but you couldn't ask for a better camping/survival knife. even just for a regular joe. The craftsmanship and quality of this knife is apparent from the moment you open the box. I am among those who actually enjoys the nylon sheath. and I especially like the multi-tool pouch in which I can store my SOG PowerAssist. If my multi-tool is elsewhere it's a great place for a sharpener or other supplies.Big thumbs up to SOG!"
9,"The knife itself is well made and comes nice and sharp out of the box. My only minor quibbles are that it appears to not be a full-tang knife. and it also is lacking any sort of good strike surface on the butt. The only other downside is that the sheath that came with it (the nylon model with the integrated multi-tool pouch) isn't really that great in my opinion. It's rather bulky and I personally have no desire to store my multi-tool there. but I have a friend with the same sheath who loves it. so to each their own.That said. I have no qualms about my purchase and it's a solid. well-built knife that I anticipate will last me quite some time."
9,"I gave it 4 stars because really for recreational scuba diving IMO. a 7inch blade is too long. The Shorter 'SEAL Pup' is a better knife. That said. this is a pretty tough knife. Not as strong as the Strider WB or TAC 10/11. but still strong enough for recreational scuba divers. Those other knives are also way more expensive. like 3x this one.  The sheath which isn't pictured here is very high tech. It holds the knife firmly. has lots of straps and loops for almost any carry position. So a better choice than those cheapy but flashy dive knives from US Divers."
9,"Amazon shipped super fast...yay!I got this recently and it is really a super solid sexy knife.  Pulled it out of the box and shaved my arm hair right off...so ya...pretty sharp edge from factory.  It looks sleek & stealthyThis will be one of my camping knives.  I go camping around lakes and beachs so getting it wet and working fish. battoning wood and such with this knife will not been an issue.  Well balanced knife...feels natural in my hands...will take a pounding and keeps on ticking.Love the sheath...well made and I like that side pocket to store my firesteel and a mini knife sharpener.SOG...what more can I expect"
9,"The SOG SEAL knife is a very good knife. The blade came with a decent edge on it. The sheath is very good quality. There is a plastic insert that the blade slides into. A couple things to mention...First. the knife is made in Taiwan. So if you want an American made knife skip this one. Second. the knife handle is a hard (Zytel). I don't know why. but I assumed the handle would have a little give to it. The checkering does help with the ability to grip the handle though. I'd like for the guard to be a little more prominent. just in case my hand ever slipped. The end of the tang meant for hammering won't help you out too much except for small things. It is only about a quarter inch thick. Overall this is a good knife that I would feel comfortable having with me in the field if I didn't have my KaBar."
9,"Very simple yet elegant design.  If your looking for a great simple EDC option that will not take up much room in your pocket and won't weigh you down. then this is a great option.  It has 1 full sized plain edge blade. and 1 smaller plain edge pen knife.Something to note is that this knife does NOT come with tweezers or toothpick.  Nor does it have a key ring attachment.  This knife is more or less something that you could carry when wearing a nice suit.  It's very streamlined and slim."
9,"I bought this pocket knife for my daughter and is just what we wanted.It is good looking (glossy red plastic handle covers with golden logo) and functional and we like the fact that it has two blades so you can use one for the rough work and save the other to have a nice sharp edge when you need it.The blades are a bit hard to pull out (maybe they will break in with time) but once they are out they swing and click very firmly in the open position; there is no play from side to side or nay other kind. I guess it is hard to ask for a firm blade lock and have an easy pull out as well. Anyway. if you have good nails that shouldn't be a big problem.The long blade has a decent size for most jobs that will be used for. and so far I haven't seen any scratches from the other stuff she caries in her purse.Overall we (especially my daughter) like it a lot and we recommend it."
9,"My only experience with playing Horseshoes is when I was a kid with my Dad. so I wasn't quite sure what to look for when I got the whim to build a pit in our backyard.  I went to the local sporting store and looked at sets and they seemed kind of cheesy so I came on here to look up sets and found this one.  It was a little pricier than the ones in the store so I was hesitant to order. but after reading the reviews I did and after getting I them I found they are definitely worth the few extra bucks.  They are quality. well-constructed and Made in the USA.  They feel good in my hand and came with instructions to refresh me on how to play the game.  The paint has chipped some but that hasn't bothered me since it doesn't interfere in playing the game.  I would recommend this set to anyone interested in backyard games."
9,"This griddle is just plain awesome.  My only complaint is that the burners on my stove aren't large enough to heat it properly.  However. since it's cast iron. that simply means that I need to give it a few extra minutes of heating time.  And it does heat uniformly given that few extra minutes even though my burners are at fault.That was my biggest reason why I desired a cast iron skillet in the first place.  Because the metal one I have just didn't retain heat.  It didn't matter how long I left it on the burner. the edges would not heat up.But cast iron has nice heat convection properties which means that I can make uniform pancakes every time.Ideally. even if only cooking three pancakes on this griddle. they will come out quite small.  If you want the restaurant style flapjacks. you'll need a bigger pan.  But this is perfect for myself or even if serving a guest."
9,"This is my latest addition to my growing Lodge pre-seasoned cookware.  What I really like about this one is the size - perfect for two adults. or to make a tasty breakfast for 2 young kids.My sister has the Circulon griddle. and it's much nicer.  But for those of us who care about results. not looks. this runs circles around it in cooking ability.  I'd rather have an uglier pan that cooks better and cleans up well than some facier piece.A light coating of canola oil was all that was needed to fire out some nonstick pancakes on the first use.  Clean up was easy.  the one issue I had. and this is not Lodge's fault. was the batter.  The multigrain batter was way too grainy.Up next. crepes."
9,"I love cooking with cast iron. This pan is great for making those 3 egg omlets. pancakes. fried eggs. etc. The low lip makes it easy to get the spatula under the eggs and flip them. On the down side if you fry bacon or sausages in it. the grease will spatter the stove. On a campfire that of course won't be a problem.However if you have limited space in your kitchen cabinet get the combo cooker. The lid is nearly as large as this one and you get the fry pan as well.On the plus side. this pan being thin fits right under the stack of cast iron pans I already own. So if you cook for a large family and want to serve everyone faster. this is a good way to go as an additional pan."
9,"This is great for baking it just takes some getting used to.  Cookies and turnovers get over cooked unless turned.As for the reviewers who complain about the handle getting hot.  Just buy the lodge signature series with stainless handles (it only costs 5 to 10x as much) or buy a good oven mitt or two.Obviously several of the reviewers are illiterate as they didn't read the care instructions.  But to be fair Lodge doesn't say that you really need to boil water in the pan and then wpie with oil and heat before using.  The pre-seasoning only shortens the seasoning process. it DOES NOT REPLACE SEASONING!"
9,"Have had this lodge round griddle for years now and it hardly ever leaves the top of the stove.  This is the pan we used to fry eggs. potato slices. grilled cheese. garlic toast. etc. Nothing sticks to it. Wipe clean when you're done. add a touch of oil or bacon grease to season. and it's ready for the next meal.Not too bulky on the stovetop either. Cast iron cooks nice and even and you can get it hot enough to put a nice crust on potatoes and/or whatever type of meat you're cooking.Bought this for my husband to use so he would leave my pans (and not mess them up) alone. I find I use this griddle almost as much as he does! This griddle is well worth purchasing!"
9,"As a rule I prefer the type of cast iron pan that has a machined cooking surface. I have managed to find a number of these but cannot locate new ones and do not have this griddle with a machined surface. That is my only gripe with the Lodge brand. However. this round griddle has worked very nicely. I have had to re season the cooking surface but it was my fault. The grill does maintain that nice slick seasoned surface that cast iron cookware is noted for. This type of pan is great for omelets and pancakes."
9,"I got this because it was cheap and because our pans have all warped over time.  This pan is made of very heavy durable metal.  I don't think it will ever warp considering it weights near 10 pounds.  Anyways. this is a fantastic grill.  Just made an egg on it and it cooked in like 4 minutes.  With our warped pans. it took like 15 minutes after fidgeting the pan around on the stove level to make it level with the grill.  In other words. this pan is excellent and should never warp on you.  It fits our stove perfectly and I am glad I found one this cheap."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"I have used this griddle on the stove. in the oven. and on the grill.  The seasoning it came with was adequate enough for me to get started cooking right away.  I am a novice at cast iron cooking but have been studying up on the best techniques to try and avoid some of the horror stories of other first time users.  The first items I cooked were some hamburgers and had no problem with sticking.  After several more meals (one including a couple of strips of bacon) I attempted an egg.  I had no problem with the egg sticking and as always cleanup was a breeze.  As long as you take proper care of this griddle I see no reason why it shouldn't last a life time with little to no sticking.  On a side note. my wife has said that I have made the best tasting hamburgers and steaks while using this griddle."
9,"I bought the griddle to use on my new induction cooker as an interface plate - in other words I put the griddle on the induction cooker first. then put a regular pan on top of It to heat. This allows me to use my existing 'cheap' pans with my induction cooker until I can gradually replace them with steel bottomed pans.The griddle works way better than I expected. There is no significant difference between heating a pan of water placed on the griddle as heating water in an induction ready pan (I only have 2 of induction pans at the moment). A cup of water boiled in 45 seconds in an induction ready pan (amazing) and about 20 seconds longer with the griddle in between. I can deal with that!It's a shame that induction cooker manufacturers don't sell 'affordable' interface plates - I've seen them online for $80-$100+!!!! This method works for me and cost less than $15!"
9,"Extremely useful especially with my induction cooktop.  Those will not work with aluminum or ceramic pots or pans and the Lodge pans are quite heavy.  But by putting this griddle on the induction cooktop I can use my lightweight aluminum pans and ceramics too.  True. I lose a bit of heat efficiency but not enough to make a difference.  The low lip on this griddle lets me use my pans with handles easily.  I have larger Lodge cast iron pans that will not let me do this.  So for use with induction cooktop this works great for me."
9,"I do a lot of cooking with cast iron.  In the kitchen.  On the grill.  In the fire pit.  And especially camping.  I have 4 dutch ovens. and a multitude of 12 and 10 inch skillets.  But I didn't have any flat ones.  Did I need this piece?  Did it meet a need none of my others were meeting?  No.  But I thought for the price. why not add it to the collection.  I wish I did sooner.  The pre-seasoning on it is excellent.  It worked like a champ from the get go.  And unlike a lot of other 'pre-seasoned- pieces I have bought. there was zero sticking and it cleaned up with a rinse of water and a dry towel.  Boom. done.Eggs. any style. have cooked perfectly with zero sticking.  Bacon. steak. chicken. etc... have all come out great.  I love this piece."
9,"I have discovered. through purchasing this pan to replace a different crepe pan. that I am crepe-handicapped. I tried. I really did to make beautiful crepes the likes of which I had in France all to no avail. Nothing to do with the pan and everything to do with me apparently. I do love this pan though. It is wonderful for pancakes and probably anything else you may want to cook. This is the lightest Lodge pan I own and it is so nice to work with. No hot spots. no cool spots just perfectly cooked pancakes that were made after my bitter dissapointment with the crepe batter. If you are not crepe-challenged (as I am) I highly recommend this pan. You cannot go wrong with lodge."
9,"Griddle came yesterday and like all my cast iron I seasoned it. Washed with hot water. dryed it and put a light coating of veggie oil on the entire pan and baked in the oven upside down at 350 degrees for an hour. This extra step is worth it and as long as you do not use soap you do not need to do it again.Used the griddle today to make pancakes and it was completely non-stick. Not only is it healthier to cook with it browns the pancakes much better than a non-stick griddle. Cleanup was easy. just wiped with a paper towel. Lodge is the best!"
9,"This is a great pre-seasoned griddle. I make perfect pancakes and crepes everytime.  I usually add a teaspoon of vegetable oil before cooking to keep the surface extra slick although I probably don't need to.  Making crepes is as easy as making soup from a can.  Be aware that the handle gets hot so keep an oven mitt close by and follow the cleaning instructions. you don't wash this with soap or stick it in the dishwasher. This is one of the few lifetime purchases you can get for under 20 bucks.  So cheap I'm going to buy another one."
9,"After becoming pregnant. I've tried to carry water with my everywhere and not in a plastic container (due to chemicals. BPA. etc.) This sig coated aluminum works great - it doesn't have a taste and it cleans very easily with a bottle brush. and the lid with the hole is very very handy for toting around on my finger or carrying with one hand.I've actually dropped it several times so it has a few dents now. but I am glad I went with these instead of a glass bottle. which is also supposed to be very good to drink out of. but that would definitely have shattered by now. The little dents don't bother me and the outside color/finish is still fine. I prefer this size to the larger SIG sizes as it is not too heavy to carry around in my purse. and this has never once leaked on me. It keeps water nice and cold for a short time too."
9,"I didnt buy it for its trendy looks. altho it is nice looking. But I bought it for its ability to be recycled.Some say the paint chips if you drop it. thats true altho no big deal to me. I'd rather have less paint from the getgo. on it as thats makes it even more eco-friendly.The bottle will 'sweat' with ice cold water in it so could get things wet in your purse/ backpack etc.But the bottle itself does NOT leak.Also if you ride a bicycle with it. you have to stop & unscrew the cover to get a drink. not like the squeeze bottles in which you could continue to ride & drink."
9,"I don't say the cap is odd because of it's built-in carabiner support. but because if you fill it just a tad too much. you'll inadvertently create a 'bubble' underneath the cap for when you open it. will pop and leak fluid everywhere. I learned the hard way. and now only fill the bottle up a certain amount before putting the cap on.The bottle does keep liquids insulated nicely. but if you want liquids to stay hot/cold for longer. get an insulated sleeve that will fit this bottle.I like the integrated carabiner/clip loop. as it allows for the bottle to be properly secured to a bookbag. or anything that a hook can be hooked to.It feels like it was built with quality in mind. as I don't think I will be worrying about it falling & cracking or denting. It's easy to clean. doesn't leech into drinks. and is BPA free!"
9,"Originally I had bought the Howard Leight Impact Sports electronic muffs but had to return them due to fit. I bought these to replace them and I really like them. The fit is really nice and they are comfortable. The noise cancellation works well too in outdoor and indoor ranges. I didn't find the battery compartment too difficult to get in to using a flat head screw driver. The negative thing I found was that the on/off button knob fell off when I first turned them on. Perhaps putting some locktite might help there."
9,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units. and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me. especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all. so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options. and if they weren't on sale. it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries. I cant get the things out."
9,"These earmuffs are amazing. The price is the best on the internet.Do not listen to the other reviewers who claim that it is impossible to install the batteries.Any competent person who reads the directions can do it in 1 minute.As for the complaints regarding the on/off knob. when you take them off and are about to place them in your range bag make sure they are switched to off.These earmuffs work how they are supposed to. they are low profile and look nice and at this price are extremely affordable."
9,"Thank you for the nice ear protectors!I have already put them to the test and they work great since my ears have become more sensitive over time and a product like this is like heaven sent.I did not mind the battery installation being a little difficult since maintenance of your equipment requires you to know how.It did come apart easy enough once you know where to install the thin flat screwdriver to separate the ring from the cup.I like it's ability to compact to take little room in a range bag by folding up like a ball."
9,"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically. like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs. they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However. when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room. construction site). they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries."
9,"I purchased this item for a friend of mine and as well as for myself and we both really enjoy them because they amplify the sounds that you hear around you except for loud noises such as gunshots.  Its like wearing the regular type of ear muffs. but with the ability to hear and then some.  We use them for hog hunting and these hearing protectors allow you to hear what is going on around you as well your conversations as if you we not wearing them at all.I am not sure why people complain about them being uncomfortable. but I wore them for over 5 hours and not a problem and they folded up nice and neat just like when they arrived.I would highly recommend them and they take a total of 4 AAA batteries two in each piece and you can control the volume individually.  I would buy them again. They will not leave you a ringing sound such as wearing nothing at all."
9,"Meh...I bought these when a &#34;friend&#34; said they were better than the Howard Leights.  They're not.They do the same job. but complicate the issue.  Instead of one battery compartment (like the HL's). there are two. one in each ear.Rather than a single volume control. you now have one for each ear.  Great if you're a geriatric with varied hearing capacities in either ear. but just a nuisance when you want them both on the same volume anyways.Changing the batteries is a PITA!  Just a really disappointing design. to be honest.  I'd recommend the HL's over these 100% of the time.  Same price and better design."
9,"As others note. battery insertion is pretty hard and takes enough force that the plastic must be close to breaking.  My first set of these worked for an hour and then one earpiece stopped amplifying and instead it started buzzing and whining.  Amazon quickly replaced them (good job Amazon) and the new set has worked so far.  And I didn't break them putting in the batteries. but maybe next time?  Anyway. low profile. good at blocking sound. and the audio gain is sufficient to help with hearing people talk."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"First off. these amplify ALL sounds. so they are useless in a factory where there are constant noises echoing from a distance.When I walk on concrete. my FOOTSTEPS get isolated by these headphones. and the phones mute for almost a half second EVERY step. I cant even hear myself walk WITHOUT these on. They are hot and not exactly UNcomfortable. but you feel much better NOT wearing them.To top it off. I got it at the last GoldBox deal. and I was *NOT* sent the '7S' model I paid $99.99 for. I was sent this 6S model that retails for exactly $79 on Amazon. and I didnt notice until 5 weeks later."
9,"I got this compass because many on the net have referred this as the best compass on the market. I think this may be too much for most users but if you want the best this is it. Its a professional grade product with a lifetime warrantee so you cant really go wrong. Its a little bulkier than most other compasses I have used but it does have a nice rubber housing which doubles as a pencil eraser (for erasing pencil marks on topo maps) and a bunch of referenc cards housed behind the compass. This compass includes an inclinometer for measuring slope grades but I have not had the opportunity to use this feature. Good for orienteering. SAR work. professional pursuits....but might be overkill for general outdoor use."
9,"This compass is just what you need if you're trying to navigate using maps. It's well made and very reasonably priced.The compass is easy to read and is well damped by the liquid inside.This isn't the type of compass you'd want to use for regular hiking. but it very well suited for use with maps and charts. Since it doesn't fold. you'd have a hard time putting it in your pocket.For normal hiking. I prefer a lensatic compass. It's very easy to shoot a bearing to a landmark. Brunton makes a pretty decent unit."
9,"When I considered returning the compass for smaller ones. I learned that Amazon does not accept returns for this item due to hazardous material regulations.  Not a problem in my case. but thought you'd all want a heads-up before purchasing.I purchased a few of these as additions to emergency kits I built for friends/family (see my Listmania lists).  I planned to make the kits out of Nalgene bottles. but the compass is a little too wide to fit. so instead I made the kits out ofMTM Survivor Dry Box with O-Ring Sealwhich worked out better anyway."
9,"This an excellent. inexpensive compass which I use in the car for navigating. I understand that one needs a sighting mirror for serious work. but I just use it in the car. It has good visibility. is lightweight. accurate. and best of all. doesn't cost that much. It's cheap enough so that if I lose it. I can buy another one. and it's more than accurate enough for my needs. I like the green baseplate. which allows me to find it in low light if I drop it. The needle is quite responsive. and you don't have to jiggle the case to get it to move as in many cheap compasses. All in all a good. decent quality. inexpensive compass."
9,"This `easy-to-read' compass is perfect for map and compass orienteering.  It has a tool free adjustable declination for easy navigating and gives you graduations in degrees.  The scale is in both inches and millimeters and the clear plastic makes for easy use on any map.  Unfortunately. there is no site-mirror. which makes for a more accurate reading.  It's small size and price (under $10!) makes for a simple. efficient compass when backpacking or hiking.  It's a good beginner compass. but remember that you get what you pay for. For a little more money you can get a nice 'Lensatic' military compass with a sighting-arm."
9,"It is what you would expect a official MLB Rawlings baseball. It comes in a cardboard box with a piece of tissue paper. The reason only 4 stars is one of the 2 balls i bought had a minor blemish right on the sweat spot. The spot was small enough and I was using the ball for a autograph right away so there wasn't anytime to replace it.There is another option that comes in a acrylic display case that you can find for about the same price if you look around which will save you buying a separate display case later if you plan on displaying the ball.If your buying this for a autograph you can't get better than a ROMLB but if your getting something signed maybe plan ahead so you get a flawless ball or buy one in a display case from a store so you can see it before you buy."
9,"The Airzooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The Airzooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own. but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)Recommended!"
9,"I purchased one each for my niece and nephew. Almost ordered one for myself! I recalled when I was a child. something like this was out there & I recall being amazed and in general having a fun time all around. Who can resist shooting the dog with a puff of air or even more nefarious escapades ;-) ?!? Well. when I saw this. I decided that the younger generation should have some of the same fun. rather than just another video game (how in the world do you lovingly torment your pet with one of those??).Needless to say. the kids have had a BLAST (pun intended). Smiles all around!Issues include difficulty and frustration in assembly. large size (yes. I understand the reasons/physics for the size). and durability over the long haul.Still. when the snow is freshly fallen and you send a blast of air at a pile between yourself and your unsuspecting friend or family member--well what more needs to be said??!!"
9,"This thing is really pretty amazing.  I took it to work and annoyed people with it all day.  It will shoot an air-ball at least 20 feet or so.  My son uses it until we make him quit shooting his sisters with it.  The dog hates it.  It has been pretty durable as we have had ours more than two years.  The 'sights' are decently accurate also if you use them correctly.I bought mine for $5.00 at a 'dollar' type store.  At $15.00-20.00. I probably would not have bought it.  But now that I have it. I would say I have gotten at least $50.00 worth of fun out of it.Anyway. it is really nifty how this thing can shoot a ball of air across a room."
9,"many angles to throw.Can throw like frisbee and it will go straight for a long time but you have to throw it more precisely than a regular frisbee.also like a boomerang which will come back in a big circlebut my favorite is to throw it in a reverse circle because it goes way higher and loops around several times. It's fun to throw as hard as you can so that it flies straight up and loops around almost unpredictably at first. Lots of fun! I love thesebut they hit the ground a lot and will wear out. Mine are worn out a bit but they still fly pretty crazily but I want a new one soon just for a perfect flight."
9,"The instructions on this boomerang are so easy to follow that my 12 year-old daughter had it coming back by her third throw. Compared to all the other boomerangs I have seen. it is the best flying at a low price. It is very forgiving when thrown at angles causing it to dive. The instructions on all my wooden boomerangs warn that at a certain angle. they will climb to their last flight and dive to the ground causing them to break. This one has hit the ground like that with no damage. It is best to throw it in a big. wide open field. as it flies quite far with minimal effort. and as it is fairly soft. it may be best to avoid direct impact with surfaces hard. rough or sharp."
9,"I took mine out to a park and in about 15 throws I had it generally coming back to me.  The instructions say if you throw too high it will land to your left which happened quite a bit to me.  I did have it almost hit me a few times when I got it just right.  I think it's a blast.  I'm 39 and always thought boomerangs looked neat but I didn't want anything wooden coming at me.  This is very light with a soft rubber coating around the hard spine.  If you are familiar with the Aerobie Pro flying rings you know they go extremely far on little effort.  This does as well.  You don't have to throw out your shoulder tomahawking it but give it some snap off your fingers to get the rotation started."
9,"I use this if I travel mostly for the wine opener. Seriously if you want to open wine while traveling and its not a screw top why not have this on you. Also it does userfull stuff like cut things. screw's things. punctures things with the awl and lastly manicures things. Its also inexpensive. highly corrosive resistant and RED. They come in two different models that either do/dont have a tooth pick. tweezers. I DONT have the tweezers on mine simply because you end up loosing them constantly and having that empty hole on the handle bugs me. SO i figured to go with out it."
9,"I've always loved carrying the Victorinox Spartan. and have done so since 1976.  It has the right mix of tools for almost any everyday need without being too fat or tool-rich to be unwieldy in the hand.  The bottle opener and corkscrew. as you might imagine. make it a hit at parties.What I love about this one is the hardwood handle. which remarkably improves ones grip.  It's become my everyday pocketknife (except at airports. of course). and I'm pleased to carry it."
9,"I bought my first Spartan in 1979.  I have been using it since then and love it.  I also gave some as gifts to my brother and to friends.  Not a single complaint.  What I like most about it is that it has all the essentials - can opener. bottle opener. cork screw and screwdrivers.  The tweezers and toothpick make it even more complete.  It is not a multi-tool. but it is a compact. everyday handy tool. without frills.I finally had to buy a replacement because my daughter wanted one to go camping - except for a few scratches it looks as good as new and works like new.I Highly recommend it."
9,"This is my 3rd or 4th Spartan.  It cuts. opens drinks. corks. screw drivers...  It remains flat in my pants pocket.  It's not particularly heavy for an everyday carry knife.  The only thing that could make it a better knife for me. would be a single hand opening main knife blade.  My other everyday carry knives open with a flick of my thumb. so when I go to open this. 'oh yeah... 2 hands...'  Other than that. I cannot recommend this knife enough.I tend to buy the red one for loss prevention."
9,"Basic Victorinox quality but with an added twist. The wooden grips look really nice and feel nice in the hand. Gives an every day carry knife like the spartan a real classy look. Was impressed that they milled out the recesses for the tooth pick and tweezers both of which fit fine. No hole for the pin though. Wood seemed a little dry so I added some lemon oil. I would have preferred they had the tinker in a wooden handle version because I'm not a big fan of the corkscrew. But I added the micro screwdriver in the corkscrew for added versatility. A real bargain for a wood-handled version (compared to Wenger wood handled offerings)"
9,"I've been very happy with my purchase.  My Koolatron kept drinks and snacks very cold with no problem.  As other reviewers have already noted you need to power up the unit roughly 12 hours prior to loading it with items you want to keep it cold.  This unit is not a refrigerator so if you pack it with items not chilled already in refrigerator then it will be a long time before things get cold.Whether my unit will be reliable long term I cannot say but on my recent use I have used it four days straight without a problem."
9,"Product seems well made and arrived in good order. The only thing that I have found bad about it is the fan makes some pretty loud noise. I think it may bother me when I have it in a motel room (I also bought the AC adapter).I have some experience with this type cooler and the others I have used did not have as loud of fan.On the plus side: It fits where I wanted it behind my drivers seat. so my front seat passenger can reach back and open it easily. Quality feel to it and it is not too heavy.The instructions say only use in heat mode 'up to 45 minutes' if that makes a difference to anyone."
9,"I recently purchased one of these coolers and am very pleased with how well it worked. as quiet as a whisper.  The power consumption is reasonable.  If battery drain is a concern. once the Koolatron is cold you can unplug it for a while and it will stay cool for quite some time.The only thing I had to watch out for was that it froze my soda pop because I used it in a cool environment when it should have been switched off.  Only the things in the very bottom of the cooler froze.  Everything else was just fine.The Koolatron is attractive with contemporary colors - white. beige. and grey.  It's slender rectangular profile is proportioned for pop or beer cans to fit perfectly.  It's a well thought out product worth what they are asking for it.  Cool stuff.Overall. I am very happy with this purchase and am excited that I finally have a safe means for storing food in my camper van."
9,"Got this case for a projector I received that didn't come with its own case.  Pelican products are always very high quality and backed by a full warranty.  I received the case quickly and it was perfect for my needs.  The pluck and pull foam insert is very easy to use to make a custom fit for your equipment.  Took me less than 10 minutes to make separate cutouts for the projector. the cord and the remote.  (Useful tip - purchase a container of desiccant if you are going to store electronics or other sensitive equipment in this to absorb any moisture)"
9,"This sharpener is a pocket version of a boxed unit I keep in my shop.  The handle reverses to enclose the dual sharpening surfaces. making it a compact package to carry in your field back. if not in your pocket. as it is a little heavy to cart around in your pocket. in case you are bored and want to sharpen your knife.  But as an addition to your kit. it is ideal. and will keep or restore your knife's edge quickly and effective  Contrary to description. it is 9 inches open and 6 inches closed."
9,"I've been using this sharpener for a month or so now. Great field sharpener. I can replenish the edge on most of my machetes. axes and utility knives in just a minute or two. For a really fine edge I would and do use a stone set but this will give you a serviceable edge when you don't have the time to do that or are in the field. Keeps my knives sharp during butchering.It is compact and easy to use. If you use your knives and don't just keep them for show. you need one of these. Very pleased with the purchase and priced reasonably."
9,"We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle. therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives. I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions. but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!"
9,"The product is exactly as described. The combination of the two grits. groove for tip sharpening. color coding. plastic/rubber construction. locking sheath. etc make this a very convenient. portable and durable sharpening tool. Its not going to get you razor sharp but it will keep your field tools sharp enough. do it quickly and take a butter knife to good enough skinning quality in no time. Its also light weight and requires little to no maintenance. The only 'problems' I have with it is the width and no easy way to lay it level and supported. Both issues are easy to remedy but perhaps aspects for the manufacturer to look at for improvement."
9,"What else is there to say? I've had this particular one for years and have used it quite regularly on my knife and many other blades. The most impressive would be that I have for years now. sharpened box cutter style blades to extend their life. To put it into perspective the fact I can put an almost scalpel like edge to high carbon steel for years; with the same tool and stay nearly as good as new without deforming is amazing. I also like the small solid spot for sharpening small things like  chisels or one of the various exacto knife tips. The small grove in it is perfect for sharpening fish hooks and stitching needles.Diamond stones are the only way to go if your not a traditionalist."
9,"I recently used one of these from a guy a few desks away from me.  Long story short. after 3 minutes of careful swipes (without water). my pocket knife is sharp enough to shave knuckles.  I wouldn't shave my face with it yet but I'm sure i could get it to that level if I took the time.The pictures currently don't show it but it collapses down to half the size.  The sharpening stone part pulls out and fits inside the handle.  I travel a lot so this is going in my suitcase."
9,"I have a drawer full of knife sharpening tools. but have never been happy with the results - or at least not for long. Some seem to do ok for a while. but then either break or stop working. I expect to get a lot of use from this little tool. and I will regain a drawer in my kitchen when I toss out all the other things. All my knives are sharp now. and this tool is what will keep them that way.The only thing I would change is the size. It would be easier to use if it were wider. I think. But that's probably just going to take some practice to overcome."
9,"I am by no means an expert knife sharpener. Although I am happy to say I have some very nice knives. I've always felt a little stupid for not having the skill nor the equipment to properly sharpen my knives. I bought this stone and I have to say that it allows even a novice to do a fine job.In fact. I have nothing but good things to say about this stone set. I am SURE than an expert knife sharpener would have a different frame of reference but it allows me to put a razor-sharp edge on 154CM. 440. S30V and M390 blades that I own. I'm very happy with my purchase."
9,"These don't last long if you sharpen a good deal.  After a couple of months a significant amount of the grit is gone and you have to start seeking good spots on the sharpener. usu. top and bottom.  Same with my Lansky fine sharpener. When the grit goes. the holes (on either) start catching the edge--not good.  Still. even quality stones wear. and as I said. I just bought my 3rd one in 3 years. so there must be something right about it.  Basically. it is quick. gets a good--not great--I use Japanese water stones for my best knives--edge. Frequently. I have had friends admire whatever knife I am carrying and pull theirs out and this enables me to put a quick. easy edge on their blades and hand it back to them. tickled."
9,"Price was good. Reviews excellent. Tired of using stone whetstones. file. and leather strap.  Knew there had to be a quicker and easier way to have a working edge.Received this in the mail and sharpened the kitchen knives and scissors. Diamond has a hardness of 10: hardest natural substance known to man. I drew the cutting edge away from me so that the diamond surface abraded the metal in the direction of the edge of the knife. My father used to do it the other way. but this seems to work better for me. The edge of the knife faces me and I pull the blade away from me and drag it across the diamond sharpening stone. The metal dust quickly fills the depressions. I gently tap the stone against a Bounty Towel and the dust is seen on the towel as a dark stain. Blade is sharp in under a minute. Takes up little room. I keep it in the kitchen."
9,"Sorry. I'm just not a fan.  This stone does ok for tools like shovels or axes. but I just couldn't get the hang of it with knives.  The diamond stones were too coarse and seemed to really grab the edge and prevent you from maintaining your angle.  The absurdly fat handle also gets in the way when you're trying to sharpen. rending a good quarter of the stones useless for most tasks.  I ended up picking up a set of credit card diamond stones and am much happier with my result."
9,"Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect.  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels. axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work.  its better for larger blades."
9,"There are many cheap red dot sights out there. but few are as tough and that exhibit any kind of quality better than the Bushnell trophy series red dot sights. This one is great as it offers 11 brightness setting and 4 different types of reticles. This little guy is light and compact yet very tough. and comes with a sun shade for very bright outdoor settings. Although it uses mounting rings. they hold the scope in place very well and the sight maintains zero very well. Had mine on my ar-15 for 2.5 years now and never had to re-sight it in. It is still as accurate as it was day one! I have not changed the battery yet either after 2.5 years and it is still going strong. AWESOME battery life. A+"
9,"I put this on my Ruger Mark III Target and I am very happy. The multiple reticles would be more fun with larger targets. but at 50 yards. you only need the 3 MOA dot. Easy zeroing and not as heavy as expected. but then again. a Mark III Target is a beast of a .22 pistol. Don't buy the cheesy $20 red dot. Save your dough and buy this quality product. Aimpoints are GREAT. but over rated. If you don't mind the added weight. then this is a better buy."
9,"At first I thought the reticle was fuzzy on this tough little camper. but then I realized that - because the dot it being placed optically in the distance - I needed to wear my glasses in spite of the fact that the unit is only one foot in front of my eyes.  I put on my glasses and voila: the reticle was sharp as a tack.  Holds zero well.  I have both the single red. and red/green reticle versions on different weapons.Only bummer is you HAVE TO TURN IT OFF. or you will slowly kill the battery.  I wish it had a one-hour timer on it.  I've only lost one battery. but when your life depends on it. you don't want to be out a battery."
9,"I bought this to mount on my muzzle loader. It has the ideal magnification for deer hunting in heavy cover where things tend to get up-close and personal.  At the price I paid I didn't expect to get much more than the minimum.  This scope is much better than the minimum.  Light transmission and clarity are way above average.  The size is just right and the build quality is terrific.  My boom stick kicks like a mule but the scope hold it's zero tenaciously. I wish I needed two."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
9,"the optic is very nice i am amazed at how i can see very light rain fall 50 yards away..as for shooting with this i have not yet..also i have this mounted on my ar 15 5.56..well update this review after i take it shooting.11/13/12 update i have taken it shooting with my AR 15 and it worked great. but now its on my ruger 10/22 take down and its a perfect fit for that as well. It is also short enough to fit in the ruger bag while attached to the receiver.I wish they made this exact scope in a 2-7 magnification."
9,"I have this mounted onto a S&W; M&P; 15/22 rifle with Millett steel rings and a UTG high riser.I can look through it and see the target fine.  The unit is solid.  It's made in Korea. which surprised me.  I figured it would be Chinese.  I really don't have anything bad to say about it.  We will see how well it holds up.  I probably only have a few hundred rounds through it. but I don't expect 22LR to give it too much of a jarring.FWIW. I like more magnification than this. but I guess that's my own fault.  Now I know.  I also own the Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 4-12 x 40 which I do prefer. but that's because I like more light and more magnification."
9,"This scope is great. i sighted it in very quickly the click adjusters are accurate. this went on my marlin 22 magnum and its perfect for it. when i went to sight in the sun was very bright and directly in my face the scope didnt pickup any of the glare the crosshairs are nice and thin. it comes only with scope covers. it works great when its basicly dark. you could probly see 100 yards at night under a full moon. it was better than my own eyesight. i woild recomend this to anyone."
9,"Owned this scope for 2 seasons. Mounted on my RRA AR15. I was initially please with this scope. Made in Korea. zoomed smoothly. versatile. stayed tight on the mounts and consistently accurate. After putting about 500rds through it I was amazed that the crosshairs fell apart. That's right. The crosshairs literally fell apart. The lens were fine. scope was never dropped  or abused. Looking through the lens the crosshairs simply scattered. Weird. I liked the scope I paid $79.99 retail. and it appeared to be top quality. It held up well. I guess too many rounds went through it. Pretty disastrous failure if your'e hunting for food. Maybe pay more and get something rated for more use."
9,"This is the best scope iv ever had. I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger. It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective. It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition. I use it in PA for coyote. fox hunting at night. With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope. It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good. My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective. Wich his nikon does not offer. I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y. 1 grey fox from 125y. and a coon from 22y. I did miss another fox but it was my fault. Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping!"
9,"I own several of the Banner scopes and all have functioned as expected. There are better scopes out there that are clearer along the outer edges. and they are substantially more money. The Banner series gets the job done every time and they do so for far less outlay of cash! I also have several Burris scopes for my longer range rifles. and do prefer them for anything over 300 yards. but for me it boils down to the Banner being the right tool for the shorter range cartridges job! Bottom line is they are perfect for their intended purpose for me! Be realistic in your expectations. and you will not be disappointed in this product!"
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
9,"If you Want a decent scope that can stand the pounding it takes from a .308. then this is your scope. I previously bought a Barska scope that  shook to pieces after 12 shots.  After 3 hours of shooting. and more than 60 rounds. I shot my best pattern of the day at 100 yards. and I am not that great a shot ! The adjustments are not as smooth as a $4.000 scope. bit it is not a 4k scope. and bottom line is. it worked fine for me. Two thumbs up For Bushnell."
9,"I mounted this on my Henry lever action .22.  It fits the Henry. which is pre-grooved for rings. very nicely.  I didn't have to get new rings nor take off the iron sights. which was a big plus for me.I am not an expert on glasses so I won't (and can't) get too technical.  Lens very clear at all magnifications.  I was a little surprised nothing was included for 'clicking' the elevation/windage. but my pocket knife did the trick quite nicely anyway.  My local indoor range only goes to 50 yards and it took me about maybe 15 minutes to get it sighted in pretty close to what I wanted.  I was shooting dime sized 5-shot patterns in no time (from a sitting position. haven't done prone or off-hand yet).All in all. I doubt you can find a better bargain on Amazon than this guy if you need a cheap yet efficient rimfire scope.  100% recommended."
9,"I mounted this scope on my Ruger 10/22.  The lense is very clear out to 100 yards at 9x but it is useful to have either a reactive steel target or a glow target to help you see your hits.  At this price point. it is hard to beat this scope.Update (05/26/2010):It's been a while since I've had this on my 10/22 and my impressions remain the same.  The scope has held up very well and has survived numerous drops and bangs.  Even after all of the abuse I've put it through. it retained its zero just fine.  For this price point. I can't ask for a better quality scope.[UPDATE 07/25/2011]Scope continues to hold up well and has not lost its zero since I've installed it.  I would consider this the best bang for the buck scope if you're sticking to 100 yards for a plinking gun."
9,"Lets face it. its not worth putting an expensive scope on a .22 rifle.  I put this on my Remington 597 plinker rifle and it works great.  I shot a few hundred rounds this last weekend at 50 yards and had no problems with the scope.  For [...] bucks. its a steal!  The scope is built well and comes with a wrench for the scope rings.  The scope is easy to sight in as well.  You can't really use your fingers. but you can use a spent casing or coin to turn it."
9,"This Tasco scope came pre-mounted on a .308 caliber hunting rifle we recently bought and I have been impressed with the accuracy and quality of this bargain priced scope. The scope came 'bore-sighted' so was on-paper at 100 yards and it was easy to get sighted in at 200 yards. The scope has held zero through multiple trips to the range and roughly 80 rounds or so. I really like the 3-9x zoom capability. which is perfect for the ranges this will be used.This is a good value for a reliable scope. recommended!CFH"
9,"Not that many &#34;silver/stainless steel/ss&#34; scopes out there. so choices are limited. I never buy high-end scopes because I will break it within a couple of years because of rough usage and carlessness. So. this scope jumped out at me for the money and it proved to be a best buy&#34; in my opinion. It was practically centered (took 3 rounds to center). and after putting 500 rounds through the mini14. it hasn't drifted at all. I run a tactical training program so the 500 rounds were fired by five students at 100 rounds each. and carried through an obstacle course to boot. The rig took some falls and hits. but nothing has taken-out the scope yet. Also. I've read that the min14 is particularly hard on scope reticles. so I use a Buffer Technologies Recoil Buffer (also  bought through Amazon). but I don't really don't know if that helps the &#34;reticle problem&#34; or not."
9,"I really wanted it to work on my 10/22 breakdown. but gave up after getting it sighted in at 6x. then going to 3x or 9x.  It would not hold zero.  3x went to lower left quadrant. 9x to upper right quadrant.  Several tests convinced me I had a defective scope.  Tired of messing with lower priced variable zoom scopes. purchased a Nikon rimfire 4x- no issues.  Decided I did not need 9x on a .22 rifle.  FWIW: I do not have this problem on my large caliber Nikon variable zoom scopes."
9,"Being new to shooting using a scope I have found this one to be simple. rugged and easy to adjust . I have it on a Ruger American in 308 and once I used a little loc-tight  I have no worry about it moving .  My only complaint if you could even call it that was there were no scope rings included with the scope .  But with this set up shooting off a bench I have a .75 to 1 MOA rifle with the right ammo so for the price I can not complain ."
9,"got this for my savage fvsr .22lr .first yess the poi changes with the zoom . but you can figure that out and hold over ...on mills to compensate for poi moving...example-if u got zeroed at 9x and take it down to 6x same shott would be low.vise versa if you zeroed  on 6x ...so with the scope holding off on mils  still able to get decent 1.5 in groups at 150yrds with 22.lr and 3$ammo !! go to rimfirecentral.com to see many of the targets .yes the 9x is lil low on shooting  100yrd+ on paper but doable ...if they had a 500mm with 16x woulda been sweet"
9,"I didn't buy the scope for the case or the stand I was looking for a good mid-range spotting scope that is what my review is for. I shoot 100yds. with a marlin wmr 22 and I can see my shots on paper very good.I also shoot a Savage axis at 200 yds. and can still see my holes in targer. for someone that does bird watching or simular hobbies this is a very good scope for the price. I could read the lettering on a building that was at least 1200 yds. away 12' letters."
9,"This purple Xertube offers extra-heavy resistance co--with approximately 20 pounds--and comes with a door attachment and exercise chart.However you can increase the by stepping closer to the handles. if you are going to do pull ups this is not going to add a lot of weight but just do the job of keeping you toned. this is a perfect band for someone who wants reasonable muscle tone and travels regularly.This band is perfect for those of you who do some recreational resistance or weight training and also travel regularly.  Make sure that all instructions for use are followed. as the bands are quite heavy and can snap back and hurt you causing serious injury."
9,"I bought this specifically for the Jillian Michaels 90 day workout. I am about a month in. and it has been okay. It was the perfect size for weeks 1 and 2. and a little bit off for weeks 3 and 4. However. the quality of the band is excellent. It is very sturdy and the handles are comfortable in your hand. They have a lot of different levels of resistance. so you could probably make a good set with these varieties. I would suggest this band. but maybe not for the Jillian Michaels Body Revolution (unless you buy a few)."
9,"I really like these bands for travel workouts. They take virtually no space in your bag and provide enough resistance for a respectable workout. It's hard to quantify how much weight each one represents. For a thorough workout for each muscle group. it pays to get the extra heavy. heavy and medium bands. Honestly. it's good for some muscle groups. like the triceps. biceps. shoulders and even the back. I haven't used the door attachment. but for the chest. good old-fashioned pushups will do the trick on the road. won't they? As you adjust your foot position on the rubber. you increase or decrease the resistance. Certainly worth the money. as many hotels have sub-standard guyms and 15 minutes with these bands can work you out just fine."
9,"I bought the blue/heavy resistance band to use in two of my tube workouts. The band I had no longer provided enough resistance and it was time to upgrade.Two things to point out. The handles are not padded. Not a big deal.Secondly. this tube is about 6 inches shorter than what I was previously using. The measurements are in the description. I thought the bands were a standard length so I didn't pay attention to the length. In order to use this band in my workouts. I need to reposition my body/grip/whatever during some of the exercises due to the shorter length.The band is still a nice upgrade from what previously used. Just look at measurements if the band is going to be used as a replacement band."
9,"This is the first resistance band I have.  I admit I am a little disappointed with what I got but it is not the manufacturer's fault.  I like dumbbells better than resistance bands.  But Resistance bands make working out possible anywhere.  Good concept!  I ordered a heavier one right after I received my order.I do not know what makes a good resistance band good. a bad resistance band bad.  They just don't work the same as weights.  The most expensive resistance band will still work weird because they are resistance bands.  They are not my ideal strength training tool. but hey!  It is better than nothing.Just one advice. the medium is still too light.  Go straight to the heavy weight."
9,"This band is a good quality band.  I have only used it for a couple weeks and it has held up nice.  I prefer these plastic handles over the fatter cushioned ones.  The door attachment it comes with is nice but I am not 100 percent at ease while using it because the ball stopper on the strap that's supposed to keep it from snapping back at you should be bigger.  Maybe its ok. but if you use it with a door that does not close solid then it might find its way in your face or back.  Bottom line is just be smart about it.  Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and will purchase another resistance soon."

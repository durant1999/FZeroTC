1,"I would recommend this for a travel magnifier for the occasional reading.I had read on another review about a magnifier having a problem with the light coming on. I did find that this one appeared to be DOA out of the box. But. after opening & shutting the viewer to turn on & off the light. the light began to come on. After several times of doing this. the light appears to be coming on all the time.It is small. but for taking it someplace & reading things like a menu in a dark corner of a restaurant. this is great."
1,"These are lightweight and efficient and have some very good points:- the batteries last 2-3 months with daily use.- the LED is bright enough and adequately covers the whole magnified area under the 3X lens-- the lens itself is glass and good quality- the shell is plastic and it&#8217;s very light (but may not take a beating over time)-  it&#8217;s easy to open and turn on the light and the sliding mechanism has never failedI bought a six-pack of these from another vendor and all I can say is to shop around because prices vary tremendously.  I use this magnifier to inspect seeds and leaves.  I keep these magnifiers on my desk. in my briefcase. and in a backpack and I like them a lot."
1,"Seems to be a legit 3X.  I bought my first and everything perfect.  So I bought a 2nd for my nephew - but that one had the light issue someone else mentioned (really dim. flickering).  Before I sent it back. I wanted to check the batteries - so I unscrewed where they are. took them out. but it looked like the contact on the right battery on the unit(uses 2 small watch-like ones) had some kind of grime on it - wiped that off. and I also bent the little tab to stick out a little more to give it a better contact on the battery - did that for the other side as well (it's different because of the +/- but you can bend both sides out a little).  After that. put the batteries back in and it works like my good one."
1,"I'll admit it.  I fought like crazy when people started suggesting that I get a magnifying glass.  Yes. I could no longer some menu descriptions. especially in low light.  And when I needed to see the model number on an electronic device's sticker. and couldn't. well. that was a problem too.  After I accepted that I had a problem. I refused to get an old-fashioned magnifier. like my mother uses.  So. I looked around and this caught my eye (haha). I've been using it for a few weeks now and I love it.  It is black and sleek. and. yes gets the job done.  And. those low light environments?  No longer a problem. since this has a built in light that turns on when you slide open the magnifier."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
1,"This is a great little portable magnifier with light.  I bought 2 of them so I could keep one in my purse and have one for my desk.  However. my husband liked the blue one so much he took off with one and now I need to re-order!It is slightly curved so it feels good in your grip.  Closed. it measures about as long as your standard full-sized desktop mouse and about a half inch thick.  The viewing glass area is about as big as the face/screen of a flip style cell phone.  When open it emits an impressively strong light that works like a champ in the darkest of rooms. As it is an LED light it should have a very long operating life as LEDs don't require a lot of power.  Presumably the battery could be changed if needed as there is a small door with a single screw located behind where the light is housed.  5 stars!"
1,"This magnifier has nothing to cover it when not in use.I compared it with a Carson 3x magnifier and this one did not seem as clear as the Carson - hard to see the furigana clearly in Japanese comic books with this one.The Carson ones come with a cover.I would recommend the Carson 5x if you are looking for good size enlarging.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out MagnifierI wish I had skipped the 3x and gone with the 5x only.For this one in the 3x. the light works well and lights things up nicely.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out Magnifier"
1,"purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier. this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu. for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page."
1,"This magnifier is convenient. in that it is in a container. so it prevents scratches on the glass. but it's a lot bulkier than I expected it to be. Also. you have to move the angle of the glass around or the lettering looks distorted at times. and I don't like the 6x magnifier at the bottom right corner of the lens - it's distracting. The LED light comes in extremely handy in the dark. and is nice and bright. but only on the side of the glass that the light is located. It does it's job. i guess. but not what I expected."
1,"I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times. that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients. etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money."
1,"Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However. I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling. even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass. but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes."

1,"ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging. but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale. Lights powered by them are semi-bright. and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier. MyBatterySupplier. I ordered the50-pack. which did come in the new hologram package. and the difference was dramatic.  Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant. and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars."
1,"This is a great price for batteries. you could pay a couple of bucks a retail store for only 1 or 2 when you can get 10 on Amazon!  These little LR44's are found in so many of my children's toys. the Thomas the Tank Engine cars that talk. Tinkerbell that glows. Christmas ornaments. even some little cheap twirling lights bought at the dollar store.  I have ordered these twice now. because something new dies and I find that it needs the same kind of battery.  It's definitely more economical to buy in this quantity than buying a couple at a time!  They also work well and last. too.  Stock up HERE!!"
1,"Bought 3 packs. prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $3 each. but they are easy to check in the card and all were good.  Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I hadn't reviewed them.  Very pleased.BTW. it is true that the description is misleading. the batteries I received are alkaline. not silver-oxide.  I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices. but for toys and flashlights. alkaline is a better value."
1,"I've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera. I've had the same problem: I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later. I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day. having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries. I'd had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin. and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them."
1,"In this day and age it is hard to understand why everyone isn't using rechargable batteries.  I own about 6 packs of these batteries.  They are wonderful.  I bet I have saved hundreds of dollars so far and keep saving.  Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times.  I absolutely refuse to by disposable batteries for the most part.  It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal energizer alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power.  For example Digital Camera's take a lot of power.  But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now.  I highly recommend them to everyone."
1,"I use my rechargable batteries for just about everything. Be it remote controls. cameras.and flashlights and I haven't noticed any rapid deteriorating of the batteries. Recharging takes about 12 hrs but I keep extra just in case. The only issue I have had is the price - it keeps going up. I've seen them priced as high as $12 for the 4 pack. I have also seen them as low as $7.99 at Menards they average about $9.99. If you decide to use rechargable batteries just make sure you have extra ones for when they run down."
1,"I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use. they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not 'Great for the environment' if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :("
1,"I have mixed feelings about these batteries.  They take a good charge and hold it better than my Duracell rechargebles. but still lose about 10% overnight.  I use them to power a one-LED night light outdoors.  It keeps it bright for at least three nights if I remember to turn it off during the day.  One of the four batteries is a little loosey-goosey.  Sometimes it only charges about 75%. though another recharge cycle will restore it to full again.  Considering other reviewers' comments about funky batteries. maybe they should tighten their quality control."
1,"I have 4 kids and we were using batteries like crazy.  I don't necessarily like throwing all of those batteries away when there are rechargables.  I went to the store without doing any research first and just picked up these Energizers 2500mAhs.  Needless to say. most don't work after a year.  I couldn't get my programmable thermastat to even work because it had such a low charge coming straight off of the charger.  And today. my sons batteries died in his guitar. took the ones that had just gotten done in the charger and they didn't even last five minutes. and boy he wasn't very happy.  I think I would have been better off getting those junky ones from the dollar store.  Look for a better brand!"
1,"I originally got this for my daughter's leapfrog leap pad. She was going through batteries every couple of days. so rather than go broke buying batteries. I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries. 4 Batteries Included. which gives us a set to put in her leap pad. and a set to keep on the charger charged.  It charges well. and is always ready when I need to swap them out. It is definite woth the money. especially if you go through a lot of batteries."
1,"I was going through quite a few batteries for my cats' toys: there's a chase-the-string toy. a chase-the-mouse-tail toy. and a whoo-hoo!-chase-the-laser dot toy.  Using the rechargeable batteries works well - I have an Energizer charger and two sets of 4 AAs to rotate. so they've always got something ready to pounce on!  I'm saving money and not throwing away so many batteries. and the cats don't notice the difference!"
1,"While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands. I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.  I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience. as it depends what you use them for. but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use.  They're nearly worthless to me.  I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year. so hopefully those will work as promised.  I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these.  Try another brand."
1,"I'm a die hard geocacher - and the best AA batteries I can find for long life are the Energizer Lithium 9x batteries. but they are expensive and it bothers me to dispose of so many batteries (even recycled) in a year.  SO. I bought two sets of these and a charger and they work well.  Not great. but well.  I have to change batters in the outdoor GPS twice for a full day of caching whereas I could go all day on the Lithium 9x ones.  Sort of an inconvenience. but going green on anything seems to have it's convenience price tag...Good batteries.  Have the Rayovac rechargeable AA's as well and these seem to be a LITTLE longer lasting on a full charge."
1,"I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it's completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn't pump water anymore. I wouldn't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out. the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they'll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt. Overall I'd rate this unit as 'build quality: poor. life span: short. effectiveness: disappointing'."
1,"Duracell 9 volts are the only batteries I use in the wireless microphones we use for our instructional video business. We replace the batteries before every shoot and sometime run for up to 10 hours non-stop. Wireless microphones use a lot of power and we have found that the Duracell batteries can make it through an entire day of shooting. lasting about 25% longer than the less expensive generic types we tried before.We also use Duracell 9 volts in our smoke detectors at home. They might be more expensive than some. but they are worth it in the long run.Highly recommended!"
1,"Although I'm sure my local fire department will cringe if they read this. I buy these things for our backups for our fire alarms and they last over 4 years!  Wow!  Now if I buy a knockoff brand. or even Energizer. I can only get 18 months out of them before they start squealing to be replaced.  Plus. this 8 battery pack makes it awfully simple to have them around when it comes time to change them. and it's the right number for my house.  Love these Duracells!  Highly. highly recommend!"
1,"You want a battery that is going to last. then you can't go wrong with this one. I bought the 8 count because my garbage can needs 4 and the shelf life of these batteries is so good that I have no doubt it will provide me with the many months of use. Since I have the first 4 still being used. going on 7 months now. I am going to guess at least 1 year before I will need to replace so yes. a good purchase price for this 8 pack."
1,"For most people. that's what you will need these for.  And once that stupid thing starts beeping at 3 AM (I swear its programmed in that way by some sadist at Big Smoke Detector). you are going to want to have a 9 volt ready.  Because you are not the kind of monster who would let your family burn to death (well probably smoke to death if we are honest) cause you were too cheap or lazy to replace the battery.  That's not how you want to get on the local news (that or &#34;local cat hoarder in Guinness Book of World Records&#34;).Given that these have the &#34;Durablock&#34; feature they have a long guaranteed shelf life. so feel free to splurge on this 4 pack of 9 volts.  You will be safe. and feel like a big spender."
1,"Of all the batteries I use. I really dislike D size. They're heavy. and I understand that they have to be. So the question was. do I want to spend a small fortune on rechargeable D's or get the tried an true Duracell D. You know the answer. I use these in one huge flashlight and in two motion sensor lights on our house. I can't tell you that these are better than the bunny batteries. but from my experience. these just keep going. and going. and going. Since the motion sensors are used on a nightly basis (the sensors have picked up raccoons. skunks. and opossums which we didn't even know we had in suburbia). I think it's amazing that we haven't had to replace the batteries yet. and the light is still as strong as ever."
1,"I've used Duracell batteries for years. and they've always been reliable. I would like to mention two things that stood out with the most recent D-cell Duracells (8-count package) that I bought in the 8-pack:* The expiration date is December 2023. more than ten years after I purchased them.* The packaging is some of the best that I've seen for batteries. and if you don't need all eight of them now. the packaging also serves as a nice. resealable container. Also. it was extremely easy to open. needing only a small pair of scissors to cut where indicated.I also recently purchased an 8-count package of Duracell C-cells. The same comments apply. except that the packaging is different (cardboard instead of plastic) than the packaging the D-cells came in. and the expiration date is only nine years out.Call me a very satisfied customer."
1,"Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap."
1,"This is just a battery right? (Duracell Coppertop with Duralock)The D cells I received from Amazon have a expiration date on the battery Dec 2022. Bought these Dec 2012. so I get 10years. See photo in customer photo section.Great to see expiration date on battery!!  NO MORE GUESSING if they're too old.My D cells came in a plastic box suitable for storage.Price here on Amazon for 8 D cell was much lower than any retail outlet.Good price. fresh batteries. 5 starsShips from and Sold by Amazon"
1,"Duracell batteries are my favorite for reliability and endurance.  In my opinion. they provide more continuous output than any other competitor battery. The chief competitor. Energizer. does not last as long in my appliances than does the Duracell.  So. when I buy batteries. I buy Duracell.  This said. be aware of the following facts:  Duracell's cost slightly more than Energizers. so perhaps the Energizers are more economical in the long-run.  Second. always check the expiration date on the batteries.  If the expiration date is near. return them and ask for the package with the  longest expiration date.  Finally. store batteries in the refrigerator for longest storage life.  Shelf life at room temperature depletes all batteries.kone"
1,"Needed to purchase these to power a portable fan. Came well packaged with no damage (from Amazon proper) and the expiration date was years in advance.  Batteries performed as expected. pricing a bit more than 3 hours of continuous power to a portable fan set on &#8220;high&#8221;......  Basically. these are very expensive to use and other types of batteries (re: rechargeable) would be a better purchase although there are just times when only a &#8220;D&#8221; Cell will do.As long as there is no visible damage and your exp. date is ok. these Duracell Alkaline Coppertops should perform well. I have never had any trouble with them over the years."
1,"Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks.  Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries.  I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong:  They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes.  Note to seller:  How long did you think you'd get away with selling dead (and possibly fake) batteries?  Note to Amazon:  Please investigate this seller!"
1,"I purchased quite a few toys over Christmas that required batteries. Luckily Amazon has batteries at a low price in large bulk to cover my needs.The batteries show up in Amazons no frills frustration free packaging with an expiration date several days out. Other individuals. unfortunately. have received batteries near or past their expiration date as well as less than acceptable packaging. I would do two things:1) Make sure when you are ordering the batteries that you are ordering from amazon itself and not one of the other vendors that may pop up replacing amazon.2) When you receive the batteries make sure you check the expiration date of the batteries and. if you have a volt checker. test the batteries.Overall a good deal on a wide variety of sizes and quantities."

1,"I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page. it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews. many buyers received their batteries unpackaged. just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago. I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are. but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time."
1,"I buy 2 packs of these EVERY MONTH for work. We use them for a digital scale built into our forklifts. This is in use 8 hours a day. 5 days a week... standard 40 hours. I get them with Subscribe & Save. I don't think you can possibly get similar quality for the price. and rechargeable D Batteries!? Yea right!! With the risk of damaging the batteries here. I don't think so. Not for that price. Duracell is the way to go!"
1,"We have been using Duracell for many years. and have always trusted our camping and emergency needs and devices we use to being powered by them. in one form or another.  Sure there are cheaper batteries out there. rechargeable even and solar too; and of course Duracell has their versions of all of these.We do believe in being green. and doing the best to keep our energy footprint small. and we have found over the years we can count on the Copper top for most of our needs.  And of course we should all dispose of them properly."
1,"Duracell Coppertop Duralock D batteries are premium quality batteries. as reflected in their price.  They seem to last longer than every other kind of battery I have purchased.  Although I haven't actually done any laboratory testing. they have been in a particular flashlight I have and have been in there working for about 10 years.  In a crisis or long duration power failure event. these are my first choice for survival.If you are looking for the best battery on the market. I think these are it."
1,"In general. Duracell and Enrrgizer perform significantly better than more generic battrries in terms of battery life. Yhese are no exception. I used them in a stompbox. and even though this is primsrily for practice and jamming. i don't want interruptions to change the batteries. These don't disappoint.The pricing of Duracell on Amazon has also been much better than I can get locally. Before I bought these. I tried three drugstores and one supermarket to see ifIi could pick up a better deal. It wasn't possible. The batteries I could find locally were runnng almost twice as much as these Duracells on Amazon. As long ss that remains the case. I will continue to buy online."
1,"A Christmas gift for 2 young boys who love to wander thru the woods near their house at night.  They have found goblins. trolls. werewolves. and lions. tigers. and bears....(if you wish to believe their tales!)  They are small in size but very. very bright and the light projects for a great distance.  We can sit on our back porch and tell about where they are by watching the light beam in the trees.They now also turn our couches upside down to make a tent and use their lights to read and play by.  They do that even in the daylight!  The batteries have not yet been replaced after many hours of use.  They made a great gift and got them away from the TV and computer games.  That is the biggest benefit in my opinion."
1,"I have had several maglites over the years and while reading the reviews decided to get this light because it is LED. WRONG. for some reason most of the reviews are on the LED version and this light is the battery eating krypton version.I have drawers full of these old ones and don't use them because they are just old inefficient technology.I was bummed out and requested a refund and planned to refuse the fedex shipment. But when I cancelled the order they said to just keep it. I really don't wont the damned thing but I think it would cost them more if I now refuse the package.Moral quandary.Maybe I'll upgrade it with the LED kit.UPDATE####################I bumped it up a star because it is now perfect since I added the L.E.D. mod kit by Nite-ize.It now has 25 hour battery life and is twice as bright."
1,"I've dropped my Maglite onto hard floors. submerged it in water. and subjected it to the abuses of a tornadic four year old. The all metal (not plastic!) case is nearly indestructible. Both ends are threaded and are fitted with snug o-rings to protect the innards from rain. humidity. and submersion. The lens housing twists to adjust the focus of the beam and comes off to allow it to be used as a candle (handy for nights in a tent or during a power outage). In addition. an extra bulb resides in the base!"
1,"Do NOT buy a Maglite product unless it's an LED light. Non-LED Maglite products are crap and do not have any usefulness in modern society. LEDs are the wave of the future and yet Maglite is still producing these style of flashlights. When I got the flashlight and turned it on for the first time. I could not believe how dim the light was. It's barely 10 lumens. if that. Do NOT waste your money on this product. Buy a pen light such as a Streamlight Pro or something of that nature that will accept AA's but can output over 50 lumens of light energy. Much more cost effective. lighter. more efficient and overall a better product. I'm sure Maglite is producing LED lights so if you do get one it will most likely be a good flashlight just do not get this particular style."
1,"I was taking part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine. and everyone had two tools: a Mini Maglite and aLeatherman.  They all wore them on their belts. and they came in handy on numerous occasions.  Of course I picked one up and I love the little holster that comes with it.  If it didn't look dorky I'd probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time.It's not just good for night use.  Changing a fuse. adjusting equipment. finding something under the desk.  For those kinds of everyday. all-the-time uses. the Mini Mag is much more handy and useful than the largerMAGLITE. which I also own and keep in my closet for emergencies and camping.  Highly recommended for its simplicity. utility. and durability."

1,"We have been buying these Maglite Mini flashlights for quite a while. I have yet to try their LED version. but for now these work perfectly for me. I know that the LED one is supposedly much better. but at this price point. I have a very hard time passing these up.We probably must have about 3 or 4 of these around our home. and I personally keep 1 in every toolbag or toolbox. With the cheap price of these you can have one in every room and anywhere else you can think of. You also have a wide variety of colors to choose from. but I stick to the modest. classic black annodized.I know that this is just a review for a simple flashlight. but I believe Maglite to be the best. and I hope this review helps."
1,"focus-able beam is nice. I had already bought a TeraLUX ministar2 extreme upgrade for my existing mag and liked it so much I decided to buy this to put it in a less scratched up case. for a conventional bulb the stock bulb is not very bright and unless you have a led module for it already or know enough about electronics to make one I would buy the mini mag LED. If you do know enough about electronics you can buy led lights. cut the leads and add your own heat sink for fairly cheap from parts here on amazon. I did this to my old mini mag (you can find instructions on instructables) and not as bright as the TeraLUX but 2-3 times brighter than stock for $2 in parts."
1,"I have been a fan of Maglite as long as I can remember. I don't want a flashlight that breaks easily because when I need it. I NEED IT. The Maglite line has alway been durable and solid and feels good in the hand. The design is well thought out like the 'candle mode' to light a space.This package has a nice holster. but it is small enough to fit easily in most pockets. Over the years I never had to replace the halogen bulb in a maglite but they typicall provide one spare in the bottom just in case. That kind of thoughtful reliablity plus nice design make this as great as the bigger ones.There are two of these in my house plus a LED model too. In my opinion this mini-maglite does everything I need very reliably. I can depend on it when it counts.Hope this helps someone."
1,"mini lite was just the right size for me to use when I am fixing or repairing something and need a different size of light rays to see something tiny or in detail.  The size of the barrel of the flashlight is great for my hands when I need both of them to use and can just use my fingers to grasp instead of the whole hand.  Brightness of bulb is excellent since you can adjust the rays to be full or small to see just the focus of something detail.  Light also came with an upholster to store and wear on your body so you can carry for camping use or hiking use or even for your work when needed.  It is convenient to have in a holder so you don't have to hand carry it.  Great product for the price you pay."
1,"This big pack was a huge problem solver for us.  We don't have a car so we navigate the shopping chores carefully.  We are within walking distance of many different stores and we do have a hardware store nearby but the usual purchase of a regular box was used quickly which meant constantly walking to the hardware store for refills.  Buying these has been a big relief for me. since I do most of the walking.  I am still using these and it has been MONTHS.  I will do this every time. The price is not painful and the large number of bags makes it a real deal."
1,"We use these bags in two of our trashcans in the kitchens.  We have a kitchen on the main floor and in the basement and these 13 gallon bags are just the right size for our kitchen trash containers.  By the end of the week they are pretty full and we dump some smaller trash cans into the sacks as there is still room and then they are full to the top.  I have never had one leak or tear on me and I like the tie flaps to close the bag securely and to carry it outside.This is a good product and we will continue to use it and I recommend it to you.  The price here is high compared to what we are paying and you might want to shop around."
1,"I'm clueless as to whom these trashbags are marketed. I bought them and find them pretty annoying. For one thing they DO NOT 'stretch and grab' as the marketing info says. They just hang there. If you want grabbing. try Hefties &#34;Hefty Gripper Tall. 13 Gallon Kitchen Bags). They're awesome.The other thing Easy-Flaps don't do is hold as much garbage as other Tall Kitchen bags. Because of their construction they barely fit our can. plus unless you under-fill them. there is not way to tie them off.The only good point about these bags is that they are 1 mil plastic. Otherwise they fall far short of what's needed in the kitchen."
1,"I am the dishwasher in my home. and I like good tools. It's been a slog to find a truly good dish brush. and here it is. I used the amazon.com info and went to Ace and found the same brush sold individually. Bought one. and have been using it now for two months. It cleans very well. is easy to keep from getting clogged. and it doesn't splay out bristles very much. I've trimmed off about half a dozen bristles all in all. and the brush still has a lot of life left in it. The UPC at Ace for the individual brush is 0 4130104554 3. I like this brush enough to think that I'll buy the dozen-pack when this one gets too far gone. Washing dishes with a good brush makes a lot of difference."
1,"We're not much pleased with this brush. It's way smaller than we wanted and. owing to the angle of the head. one has to get their hand in much closer in to the grubby dish or pot they're scrubbing. That makes it hard to apply much force. We bought another brush in the same order. the Libman Kitchen Brush which Amazon also sells and which is a mite cheaper. It's a far better brush. bigger and better designed. This one is ok but not good enough to recommend."
1,"Review for: Rubbermaid Dish BrushA review for the humble dish brush.  I'm not sure what it is about this one but I prefer doing dishes with it more than the many other kitchen dish brushes I've tried from various retail stores and supermarkets.  I'll gladly waste time looking for this one buried in the sink before using another one just sitting there looking at me longingly.Like a car that lets you still feel the road. the bristles are flexible and unbunched enough you can get hard pressure right into the problem spots.  Flip it around and you get nice scraping action.  Use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots.This same flexibility means it won't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles. however even scrunched up it still continues to work great.  So hats off to this simple. classic rubbermaid dish brush standing the test of time."
1,"I used these when I went on a month long safari. Had no chance of resupply and did not want to take too many standard batteries as I found in my experience that the high humidity. despite being in a tight container. drained most of the charge before I used them. Took two sets of these lithium AA plus other brands as backup. Didn't need them as the one set in my camera and one set in my recorder were still working good after I had returned. They endured over 100F to a 32F at night. 90% humidity. heavy rain. damn mosquitoes (ah..wait..that was my gripe) and worked very well. Did not have a problem with having to wait for them to recharge my units like other cheaper brands."
1,"The flat discharge curve of lithiums means they will stay above the UVLO (Under-Voltage Lock Out) conditions of your electronics power supplies. Today's electronics do not just keep working until all the juice is gone. They monitor the input voltage and when it drops too low to guarantee a stable output. they shut off. Normal batteries may still have some juice left in them but nothing other than flashlights can really make use of it. Lithiums go most of the way from full health to death in a relatively flat curve so your electronics will get longer life. Maybe only 10% to 15% wasted energy left when done compared to 40%+The price is worth it."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
1,"In an outside sensor for an indoors weather station. these batteries rock. I spent years with my outside weather readings coming and going before I read the manual and saw that they now suggest Lithium batteries. Stuck a pair of these dudes into the remote sensor and have not had a problem in cold weather. With the Duracells. and I love Duracells. I was always loosing my outside temperatures anywhere below 30 degrees (F). So far I have gotten to -4 (F) with no dropouts. Very nice."
1,"These lithium batteries are great. They are long lasting. lightweight and work great in freezing temperatures. Their 'BEST BY' date is often ten years or more. If you have a device in a fridge or freezer or outside where it gets cold/freezing. then these are very useful since alkaline batteries will often fail in cold temperatures. They are also useful for devices that are inconvenient to change batteries. like clocks or wireless outdoor temperature or motion sensors. If you're wealthy. then you might as well use these instead of alkaline or rechargeables. but because of the relatively high cost. I only use these for 'special' applications. Otherwise I use alkalines or Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries."
1,"These batteries really let you drain every little bit out of them. Make sure you use them in the correct devices. as others mentioned. They worked great in a digital camera w/ flash. I tried to use them in a headlamp - and they didn't fair so well. However even after I thought they were dead. if you let them 'sit' for a little while. you can come back and get a little more life out of them (few more shots/flash. light. etc). It was kind of funny how many times the camera would power off. and I'd let it sit for an hour and come back to find there was some juice back in them. If you have a high drain electronic device or you need longevity/cold temps in your battery - then definitely give these a try. However if you have more average/lower draw electronics. these may not seem to last as long and can be quite expensive comparatively to alkalines."
1,"I got these batteries specifically for my wife's digital camera and have been pleased with their performance to this point. When I first tested them on my battery tester they pegged the needle with their power; I've never seen another battery do that.They've been in my wife's camera now for several weeks and I test them again before we take it out for use and each time they've showed a full charge which has surprised me. If anything develops noteworthey I'll update my review but so far they have exceeded my expectations."
1,"We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic.  We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters. Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference. The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters: TIP: I did find it best to purchase and use &#34;Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#34; AA cells. Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics (and you don't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months)."
1,"I bought these batteries thinking they where rechargable. but they aren't!These batteries lasted a very long time. I would say about 4-6x longer than my rechargeable batteries. in my ebook reader.Pro's:Long enduranceHigh power outputExcellent for both high power devices (like digital camera's or flash) as low power devices (clock or ebook reader).Cons:Non-rechargableDon't last as long as they mention on the package (4-6x not 8x longer than rechargeables. and about 2x longer than Duracell batteries)Conclusion:I would never buy these batteries for the sole reason that they are non rechargable.Otherwise they are excellent for small electronic devices like clocks and small portable radio's and ebook readers.For high power devices. though these batteries are excellent. I would especially recommend to get rechargeables!"
1,"Bought these for some trail cameras taking videos. with sound. field scan etc.  Are holding up well (better than new Alkaline)  and the price was great. They also have a listed Shelf Life of 15 years. and are supposed to last 9 times longer than Alkaline batteries with high drain applications. I recommend the product and the seller Brooklyn Battery Works.  Purchased some more of these from Mel Pierce Camera (an actual store but on Amazon too)  at a cheaper price and they were delivered fast. Reason I mentioned the sellers is due to what appears to be some scammers selling them . Both these sellers are fine. fast. priced fair. new in the package."
1,"Generally. I have many positive experiences on Amazon with the exception of this vendor. Please let me explain; I received these batteries and noticed that they had an expiration date of 2027. Wow! I was 'pleasantly surprised' for the long shelf life. I then placed the batteries in my drive way alarm and noticed that my drive-way alarm did not work properly. I immediately thought that I had a defective drive-way alarm. However. I decided to check the volts of these batteries with my multimeter and was quickly surprised that 5 batteries out of 8 were defective and actually was only producing less that 1 volt. They should be 1.5 volts. After contacting the vendor. they had me send the batteries back for testing which I had to pay for. Since then. I have not heard hide nor hair from this company. They will not communicate with me. That's wrong! Do yourself a favor and purchase these somewhere else...."
1,"Hopefully these perform as described. They are exactly what I need. but who can tell until they run down how long they will work? While I was away from my Home this winter. the alkaline batteries in my programmable thermostat died and did not turn on my heating system. I barely missed getting frozen pipes. If they perform as described they will be cheap insurance for repeating this problem. but I don't know if they will work for even 10 years. but certainly I can count on a couple of years from them. fingers crossed."
1,"They are used in an Acurite weather station that we purchased.  The weather station has an outdoor sender that it mounted on our patio.  During the coldest parts of the year. the temperature on the patio can be in the teens.  Acurite. in the manual that comes with the weather station. recommends that lithium batteries be used in the outdoor sensor.As recommended by Acurite. we used the lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor.  We purchased these batteries about a year ago.  So far. the batteries have performed flawlessly.  We haven't yet had to replace the batteries in the sensor so I can't comment on their life. except to say that it's at least a year. at least for our type of use."
1,"These are expensive for daily use. I'd recommend NiMH rechargeables for that. but they're perfect for low temperature use (car flashlight in Minnesota winter. digital camera use outdoors in the winter) when both alkalines and NiMHs fail to deliver. These would also be. with very gradual storage loss. great for an emergency electronic device. Maybe for GPS or LED flashlight. Do check that your electronics are happy with these batteries installed. I've heard of both digital cameras and GPS units (Garmin GPS60) that did not."
1,"There are a lot of people that need more of a charge with electronics that only alkaline batteries cannot do. especially today's standard of electronics. Energizer has made that accomplishment with their Ultimate Lithium batteries. They work absolutely well in my hi-tech chargers for my Iphone and Ipod Touch. without the hassle of charging it to my computer all the time. They are simple to use and work great. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they can run. but when I tried them in my instant Energizer Charger. I was convinced that they were excellent at the power they have given me into my player. If you have a smartphone or a camera that needs more than alkaline batteries. I definitely recommend you give these a try from Energizer.Price: BCharging: B+Overall: B 1/2+"
1,"For almost everything in my household I use Sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries. and could not be more pleased with them.  However. I recently purchase several LED emergency road flares. and wanted batteries which I wouldn't need to check frequently.  While the eneloops are also good for long term storage in the cold. they discharge faster when it is hot. and don't perform as well in the cold as these lithium batteries. which are rated down to -40F.  If you need these for more heavily used devices. you might want to get rechargeables. but these store well and operate in a wide range of temperatures."
1,"I've just ordered a second supply of these batteries. The first set I used in a pair of salt and pepper grinders. The first thing I noticed is that they seemed to be more powerful than the Duracell batteries I was using before. They are still running strong after three month's of constant use. I would highly recommend Energizer Ultimate Lithimum batteries to anyone looking for the best. longest lasting battery. I am thouroughly satisfied with them.UPDATE: It's now been over four months and they are still going strong. I've purchased another pack of 8 just to keep them on hand when I need them. They have a 15 year shelf life so I'm not worried about them going bad over time."
1,"I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent. fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time. retain power even when they're just sitting not being used. and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls. Wii remotes. toys. etc.)."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
1,"I bought these for a digital camera which went through alkalines every 30 photos. After researching how alkalines drop to about 1.2 volts after very little use and then level out from there I learned that these lithiums maintain the 1.5 volts for a much longer period of use and consequently allow my camera to continue to work through about 120 to 150 photos. I also use these in the outside unit of my weather station because they will not fail at subzero temperatures like alkalines do. The added cost is worth it in some instances but probably not for general use."
1,"These are 'niche' batteries. They weigh half their Alkaline and NiMh brothers. store more energy. work in very low temperatures. and sit on the shelf for a decade without losing their charge.As everyday consumables they make no sense (for that. look into Eneloop rechargeables). But as the cells that power your emergency flashlight. your GPS on the Inka Trail. or your radio during a blackout. they are a godsend.Note that the voltage of these cells is slightly higher than regular AA's. Therefore. some devices actually *won't work*. at least not when the cells are fresh and fully charged! For example. people have posted problems with Garmin's Gpsmap 60csx or some regulated LED flashlights. I'd recommend you check with the manufacturer and test your device with those cells before placing them in your survival kit."
1,"got 'em quick with no problems. yes they absolutely last longer [I use them in a lable maker]. These are great batteries but are not for every app. I do not recommend using the 9v version in a smoke detector. The lithium bateries by nature go until they are completely exausted then suddenly they are completely spent wih no warning. The alkilne batteries slowly get weaker thus letting the detector let out those annoying squeeks which tell you the detector's batteries need changing. Not to keen of a flashlite blinking out with no warning. But. the tremendious shelf life and longer runs between changes is a real plus.PS Check to see that you are getting the correct ones for your needs. They have different life spands of lasting 4.5.8 and the ultimate of 9 times longer than alkiline batts."
1,"I bought these batteries specifically to go in the outdoor portion of my indoor-outdoor weather monitoring station. I tried normal alkaline batteries first. but they do not provide enough voltage when the temperature is low. Then I tried NiMH rechargeables. but those crap out at an even higher temperature. Then I coughed up the extra money for lithium. i.e. these batteries.These batteries are the only ones that work when it is very cold outside. Lithium wins!These are approximately the cheapest lithium batteries on Amazon. that is how I chose them. And they are a name brand. Go figure."
1,"i was uneducated in lithium batteries. i thought they were rechargeable. but have come to get info from energizer via their telephone rep..that only lithium ion batteries are rechargeable...that lithium batteries as these are NOT.to me then. the price value is just not there. for the price paid for these i can buy around 36 good alkaline cells.update: i have found these batteries to not last as long as regular alkaline batteries....e.g. i get about 6 months use on a clock from an alkaline but only two months on these lithiums....obviously then i will stick with alkaline over these....i have tho moved to using rechargeable cells for nearly everything anymore- usually the enelop from sanyo- these are very good and certainly cost effective..."
1,"I ordered this scrub brush with the intent of using it on sinks and showers. I first used it when I threw my microfiber couch cushions in the laundry and they came out stiff. I used this brush to easily bring back the softness that microfiber is known for.Since then I have used it for sinks. tile. shower. and linoleum. It has worked fabulously each and every time and it is now my go to scrub brush. It is extremely comfortable in my hand. they did a fantastic job with the ergonomics. It is easy to apply gentle or firm pressure based on the situation.If you need a versatile brush that works well and is comfortable in your hand. this is it."
1,"When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They. by far. have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much. I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time. I think I'll get two :)"
1,"I expect a scrub brush to be designed for medium/heavy pressure.  The shape of the handle in my hand doesn't allow me to just press down and do the job.  Rather. the roundness of the handle wobbles back and forth (left to right versus back and forth) in my palm.  Also when wet the handle doesn't feel solid in my palm.  Maybe it's just the shape of my hand instead of a design flaw?  I only deducted one star for this possibility.The bristles are high quality and the plastic piece appears of the OXO quality you'd expect."
1,"I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet. they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower. sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find. but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time. your hands and wrist will feel the difference."
1,"I have always kept a hefty scrub brush around for I have an old kitty that loves to toss up her dinner occasionally. plus a young puppy that often feels left out and follows suit.  Scrub brushes are easy to find and probably never considered here much on Amazon.  But trust me when I tell you that not only is this a terrific brush. but it is also very hard to find in stores.  The power behind this baby is its contoured plum like handle that sits directly on top.  It gives you maximum comfort for your hand while directing the brushes where you want without you getting tired and the brushes just slipping lightly over the stain.  The handle and the brushes are of a great quality and and I bought two for different parts of the house.  Definitely a vast improvement over the usual handles we all are used to seeing on brushes like this. and at a very fair price here on Amazon. The best. and highly recommended..."
1,"After reading the reviews. and recognizing the quality of OXO. I thought I had made a good decision. I was in for a surprise. I have one of those old tubs with some soap build up that is difficult to remove. With a little elbow grease. and with this superb brush. the soap scum is gone. Good grief. what a surprise. For years I have been trying to get that stuff off.  I am now going to scrub my stair carpet. Somehow. coffee stains have ingrained themselves into the rug.The raised handle keeps my hands and fingers above the brush. which makes it so much easier to use your full force. Thecontoured handle gives me a strong grasp for vigorous cleaning. The handle is nonslip. wet or dry. It is great for cleaning a variety of surfaces. from tile to carpet. There are two types of bristles for the optimum scrub. I have never found anything better for scrubbing out those darn spots!Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-08-14"
1,"I just LOVE this brush.  Not only does it &#34;feel good&#34; to the hand. but it's design allows you to easily get into the rounded corners of the bathtub whereas a flat. rectangular shaped brush made rounded areas difficult to clean.  The non-slip rubber grip is a plus as well.  I'm really happy with this purchase.  Will buy again when I need a replacement.  Have been using it for over 10 months and it shows no signs of wear.  Very satisfied."
1,"I had one of this brush already. but wanted another for outside. I use my inside one to clean tubs and shower tile mainly. and anything else that needs the work of its sturdy bristles. I use the outside one for dirty or mucky shoes. and to clean out our two flat. rectangular bird feeders that hang outside in the weather. If it rains or snows. the feeders get pretty nasty inside on the bottom. but we like them as they allow the birds. squirrels and chipmunks to all be able get into the trays to eat."
1,"This bottle brush is great. We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses. It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you're cleaning. Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I've used it on. I'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
1,"i have tried many brands and types of bottle brush and now i finally found the one.this brush is just enough soft and flexible to clean bottles well. The bristles are soft and yet sturdy to withstand pressure. Unlike rubber/silicone based brush whose bristles have no strength to stand straight. this will easily clean corner without having to jam the brush into the corner.Another good feature is the lenght. it is around a foot long. so you can use it to clean your vacuum flask/thermos easily as well."
1,"It is surprisingly hard to find a brush like this. I just wanted it to be able to clean my travel mugs really well. I don't like putting them in the dishwasher and a sponge does not reach everywhere. This is a great brush for a good price. I have been using it for about a year and it still looks great. the bristles do not wear easily so I think it will last for a long time. I am now able to reach all those touch spots in my travel mugs. carafes. and vases."
1,"It's a good sturdy brush. bends well. fits in what I need it for. but the bristles are only slightly rougher than a generic bottle brush. I use it clean glass bottles I fill with juice (from a juicer). and it doesn't get anything stuck on. It also stains easy. However. the grip is comfortable and it's a good length for 16oz glass bottles. and if you can find a different way to get things unstuck. it works just fine. I just wish it was rougher and a little longer wouldn't hurt. It does the job but aside from real sturdiness it's not much better than a generic brush."
1,"Got this for cleaning out sport bottles and stainless thermal coffee cups.  Flexible.  The bristles are not very dense and the bristle material is very light.  This is NOT a scrub brush. and I actually have concerns about how long the lightweight nylon bristles will hold up over time. but this gets the job done.  The brush will fit into anything the width of the wand portion at the top. because the bristles are so soft. they flatten out and flow (almost like wet hair...)."
1,"I have always struggled cleaning my tea pot and my Nalgene water bottles.  I would stuff washcloths into them and spin them around but I never felt like I was doing a good job.  I saw this cheap little brush on amazon and figured I'd give it a go.  This brush helps me all the time now.  It can squeeze into the holes my hand can't fit in and I can move it around and scrub the insides.  I am impressed with this brush and am very glad I found it."
1,"This is astoundingly dishwasher tolerant. It has emerged unscathed from the top rack of my dishwasher after pots and pans wash. 6 or 7 times already.Initially. I bought this to clean my tall ello glass water bottle with a narrow opening.  Now I use it on all hand wash serving and glassware.  The bristles are effectively scrub-y. are high quality soft nylon that doesn't scratch glass and collapses to fit into narrow mouth jars and bottles.  The handle is hand injury friendly with typical soft OXO comfort with appropriate density for a secure grip. A+"
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
1,"I use this to clean out all sorts of cups and bottles and it always maintains its shape.  Been using it for almost a year now and its still going strong.  Its really only for light cleaning though because the brush bristles are too soft to do much scrubbing. but they are the right softness to easily squish into a small bottle opening. which is what I bought it for.  I'd buy it again with the knowledge that its just a light duty brush specifically for water bottles/jugs."
1,"We have had a couple really nice bottle brushes that have recently just given up completely and we needed replacements fast.  We looked at all the stores we regularly haunt. but did not find anything of a satisfactory type and quality.  So online I went and found this great sounding brush and decided to give it a tryout. so far it has performed flawlessly cleaning all sizes and shapes of bottles and containers of all types as well.  Overall this has been a great purchase. and I hope they have these in the future for when this one gives up the ghost in a few years..."
1,"This bottle brush is well made and GREAT for most things. but it has a THICK stem that will NOT go into regular size water bottles. so don't buy it for that! I tried to use it on the VOSS water bottle I use (recycle.) and for spice bottles. and my sport jug - it was hopeless. You need a regular old fashioned 'baby bottle' brush with the thin wire stem for regular drinking bottles. OR TRY this incredible brush:Way Clean 33030 Bottle Brushwhich is under four dollars AND has a thinner shaft to fit more bottles. glasses. etc. and which is SLANTED to facilitate a thorough cleaning!"
1,"This brush is the best especially to clean out small mouthed bottles of all kinds & pitchers. To me the best part of this brush is it's flexibility to reach places that normal plain brushes can't reach like unreachable cracks. crevices & bends & curved glass. This thing rocks & I am very very happy that I purchased it & I will be telling a lot of people about it because it makes cleaning pitchers. water bottles. jars & any think a breeze to clean & I most definitely am extremely satisfied with this wonderful product & wonderful seller that packaged my product so well. Go get one you will be very happy that you did so."
1,"I am becoming an OXO Superfan simply because their products meet most of my kitchen needs fully.  Of those OXO products I have. not one has failed and each has performed as advertised. but with more effectiveness than I expected based on their modest prices.  I bought this brush mainly to accompany a 6-pack of 18 ounce glass water bottles that would be hard to reach without a bristle brush.  In goes the OXO and out comes the unwanted material.  Luckily. the contents have been nothing but water and nothing else that we know of.  A simple and effective brush goes a long way around here and we highly recommend this one."
1,"Great bottle brush for our household with three kids who all play sports.  So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices.  This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles.  (And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles.)  My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time. so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months.  I always buy the same one again. but I wish it lasted a bit longer!"
1,"I received this last week.  I bought it to clean jars and glasses.  Does not feel flimsy. does a good job.  The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality.  This is in a whole different class.. it works!  I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012:  This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR.  I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one.  Talk about value for money spent!"
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
1,"Sometimes a little thing makes a big difference and having the right tool for the job is one of those things.  I use a meat grinder several times a week to make pet food for cats and make sausages for myself. This requires scrupulous attention to cleanliness.  One of the parts was a little hard to clean on the inside. but this bottle brush makes the job a breeze.  It is both flexible enough to easily clean the interior. while the bristles are soft enough not to scratch the metal.  I also found it to be an excellent tool for cleaning the square glass containers that I use to store milk in the refrigerator.  As you know square kitchen containers can be tricky to clean.  This brush is long enough for half gallon containers. but it could be a little short for larger containers.  For my purposes. this brush would have been a good purchase at twice the price."
1,"I have had this brush for over two years now and I use it constantly. The colored end bristles are a little stiffer then the white ones so it's great for the bottom of jars especially the ones you have to clean for recycling. Makes hard work a breeze. After extreme daily use it still looks brand new. I just put it in a glass with bleach and water every so often to keep it nice and fresh. I purchased two and the other one is still under the sink with the tag still on it because I just can't wear this thing out! I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I bought one for a friend who looked at me like I was insane when I raved about it and now she tells all her friends to get one too! Get this brush. it is an amazing very well made cleaning tool!"
1,"My large hands make it very difficult to wash the bottom of my insulated coffee mugs (the manufacturers recommend not putting them in the dishwasher). A regular wire core bottle brush does not work very well because there are not enough bristles on the bottom and the wire always bent the wrong way. This brush solves those issues quite well - there are plenty of bristles on the bottom. and the plastic handle flexes and allows extra pressure in the corners yet still returns to its original shape. The bristles are softer than those found on most bottle brushes. but still seem to do the job. I don't know how durable it will be. but my past experience with OXO products has been very good. so I expect this brush to last a long time."
1,"My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!"
1,"BOTTLE TYPES WE OWNWe have numerous water bottles and stainless containers (Foogoo. Camelbak. Thermos to name a few).  Some are BPA free plastic. some stainless inside and out.BOTTLE NECK SIZEThe neck opening of each of our bottles varies from 1.5 inches up to 3 inches (this is a Foogoo lunch container).BRUSH BRISTLES AND PERFORMANCEThis brush is the best one we have tried (we have tried three other brands).  The bristles are firm enough to clean the bottles. but soft enough not to scratch them (unlike others we have tried).  The handle just below the brush is flexible so it bends making it very easy to get every nook and cranny in all our containers.We use it on a daily basis.  I donated our other ones after receiving this."
1,"Put quite simply. OXO has done it again!  The quality of this Good Grips Bottle Brush exceeds all expectations in both design and execution.  The engineers at OXO are experts at what they do and their dedication to customer satisfaction is clearly seen in this superb brush.  Anyone who has purchased any OXO product will testify to the satisfaction one feels in using said product as well as the incredible value OXO always presents.  The OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush satisfies as no other brush possibly can because no other proudly displays OXO on the label.  OXO defines value. excellence. durability. and satisfaction and the Good Grips Bottle Brush is virtually OXO writ large."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
1,"I just got this product yesterday.  I used it to clean out 4 of my water bottles and their lids.  Along with a long handle. the brush has bristles that stick up on the top and allow me to clean the bottome of the bottle very easily.  The brush also cleaned up under the rim of the bottles easily due to the direction of the bottom bristles.  It rinsed off easily and dried quickly.  So far. so good.  If it falls apart within 6 months I'll revise my review; otherwise I'd recomend it for cleaning water bottles/baby bottles/etc."
1,"I have a SIGG water bottle that needed cleaning. My first search resulted in a special SIGG brush that was ~$9. This was ~$4. In combination with Efferdent tablets. this brush works great to clean and refresh the bottle and remove the metallic-y smell from my bottle. (DONT BUY THE SIGG TABLETS -- SIGG Tablets are 24 tablets for ~$8 while Efferdent. which works EXACTLY the same. is 120 tablets for ~$6!!!). Be smart people; Don't buy the SIGG branded stuff since this brush (and the Efferdent tablets) work just the same. if not better for a lot less money."
1,"I like this brush. though I do wish it had a suction cup. or something. so it would be easier to be near the sink.  We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job. though. even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand. and while it was nice. the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.  For the price these are easy to replace when necessary."
1,"OXO generally makes a good product. This is a nice brush. But for cleaning out my NISSAN 34oz themas it barely does the job. The handle should be about 3 to 4 inches longer and the bristles could be a little stiffer. A mix of stiff and softer bristles would be ideal. It works well for cleaning out my NISSAN Tea tumbler. Stiffer bristles would make getting the little ring of fine tea leaf residue that always seems to collect at the bottom and just wont rinse out at the end of the day when I finally get home. Its a good product just room for improvement."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
1,"This bottle brush works really well to clean my stainless steel 27 oz water bottle. Here is why I like it:1. The diameter on the opening of my water bottle is 1 3/4 inches. and this easily fits inside.2. The handle and brush combined are a foot long. which makes it very easy to clean the bottom of the bottle.3. The leading negative review mentions another brush that has a slanted handle. which supposedly makes cleaning easier. But the handle on this brush is very flexible. and will bend and slant at whatever angle you want with just a little pressure.4. The bristles are effective at cleaning both the bottom and sides of the water bottle.5. The grip on the end of the handle is somewhat thicker. which makes it easy and comfortable to hold this brush while cleaning.Bottom line: This is sturdy and well made. and cleans effectively."
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
1,"I love the Polar thermal water bottles.  But they have 'dimples' in the sides of them that make them difficult to clean.  All my cycling bottles collect a lot of fine road dirt in them.  Until now. I've mostly lived with some residual dirt in the bottle.  I add soapy water. close and shake.  That gets most of the ick out. but not all.  But this brush is THE BEST brush for cleaning out my cycling bottles.  The handle is long enough to reach the bottom of all my drinking bottles and gallon glass juice jars.  The bristles are soft enough that the brush can be inserted into narrow neck bottles.  And they are stiff enough to do a good job of cleaning.  I don't believe in purchasing lots of specialized cleaning gadgets. but this on is a must."
1,"This is a great brush.  I use it for my 32oz Nalgene bottles and it works fine. but I also use it for my 16oz Takeya Glass Bottles and it especially works AWESOME for those because it touches all the sides of the bottle when it's in it!  When it's in the Nalgene bottle you have to circle it around to get all the sides. but not so with the smaller diamater bottles.  Handle is the perfect length and the bristles still stick out and look fine after 6 months of use."
1,"Does a great job of cleaning out my protein shaker bottles.  I used to just use a sponge. but I couldn't get in the little crevices (like the shaker spout) to get out the protein that had dried in there.  With this brush. I can easily get into little corners. while also scrubbing out my shaker quickly and efficiently.  The bristles are also soft enough that it won't scuff up the plastic shaker.  All in all. I would consider this a must for anyone who doesn't have access to a dish-washer. or who only has one shaker and doesn't want to run the dish-washer for one item."
1,"There are so many water bottles out there today that it's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle.  The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today.  You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this!"
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
1,"I am a bit disappointed with this brush. It gets the job done but the bristles seem to splay out easily when using any sort of force. I was able to use this regularly for about three months before deciding the brush was well and truly dead and I needed to find another one. I am now looking around for a new one but if I don't find one to my liking I will probably get another one of these because although it is very short-lived. the grip is comfortable and it does work fairly well while it's still good."
1,"I have white tile in all the bathrooms. and the grout gets stained. Nothing for it but to scrub the grout occasionally. Not my favorite job. but this brush is comfy and the handle is at the right angle.Here is the recipe I use to make grout cleaner. I think it works better than commercial sprays and it's cost-effective:1/2 cup of baking soda1/3 cup of ammonia1/4 cup of white vinegar7 cups of waterPour this into a spray bottle (not one use previously for bleach; I would suggest buying a clean. new bottle at the hardware store.) Spray on. scrub. Do not ever mix with bleach; ammonia and bleach release chlorine gas from the bleach and it is instantly toxic to the lungs and can overpower you quickly."
1,"I am old enough to remember &#34;The Fuller Brush Man&#34;.  After the Korean War. many veterans sold door-to-door for the Fuller Company while they were trying to get back into civilian life.  The &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34; came through our neighborhood several times a year.  Since I was the one who usually opened the door. I got a good dose of his wholesome first impression.  He carried a large well worn leather case.  When he opened it onto our living room floor. a fantastic array of brushes would spill out.  My mother always bought something.I guess OXO somehow fills the gap left by the missing &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34;"
1,"This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand. They call it a 'a grout brush'; not for brushing freshly poured grout (cement). but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium. lime and mold deposits out. Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand. Very satisfied about the results. Because of its narrow brushing head. the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted. It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out. I will reorder another."
1,"The stiff bristles on this OXO grout brush tackle even the toughest soap scum and mildew stains on grout with ease - even older white grout comes out looking nice!  The soft handle makes the chore of cleaning a bit less stressful on your hands. and the length is just perfect for the task of grout cleaning.  I find that spraying some shower cleaner. letting it soak for a few minutes. then tackling it with this grout brush makes my showers/tubs come out looking like new again.  The bristles on this brush have held up the test of time. and have yet to show signs of wear from multiple use.I wouldn't go back to any other type of brush again!"
1,"She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes. so I bought her one of these. When I saw it. I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain."
1,"I always used a dishrag or a sponge for cleaning counter tops.  Then I read a review of this product that mentioned using the brush for counter tops and stainless steel sinks.  I am so glad that this review prompted me to buy this brush.  It really cleans up the counter tops and the stainless sink looks really great after cleaning with this brush.  It is also a great tool for cleaning the interior of the refrigerator.  It has cut down the time required to do that job. and just makes this weekly task more effective in less time.  It's an excellent investment and would have been worth the cost at twice the price."
1,"This brush has a wide rubber grip handle and firm bristles.  What makes it a bit unique is its size - at 11.1' it is nearly a foot long.  You can use it to clean a large area where a smaller brush would make the job tedious. and in some instances to avoid bending as much due to its reach.The bristles are synthetic and fairly heavy gauge.  They can be used to clean corrosive acids and alkalis although this was made for use in bathrooms and kitchens.  I tested it on the shower floor and it's perfect for that type of work.The instructions say this brush can be cleaned in the dishwasher.  With most brushes. the high heat of a dishwasher would cause bristles to fall out."
1,"After getting this brush I thought the overall size of it might be a problem. but proved it wasn't for the things I have used it on. One excellent job it does is cleaning a stainless steel sink. The bristles are long and stiffer making the task less tedious and using about half the time and elbow grease of the way I have been doing it. One thing that could be improved is the handle. It should be just a bit smaller around and have finger notches on the bottom for improved handling. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."
1,"I've used this kit several times while traveling abroad.  The plug is handy. especially in older hotels that have sinks without a sufficient stopper.  My big problem is with the woolite packets.  Nearly every time I travel with these. at least one breaks open and spills all over my stuff.  Not a huge tragedy since it's soap. but a mess and a pain in the neck just the same.  I started packing them in ziplock baggies. so that WHEN not IF one of them bursts. the mess is contained.  The woolite does clean very nicely. though. and I can clean a few days of underthings and socks with one packet."
1,"No one wants to spend vacation time washing clothes in a Laundromat. especially if you are overseas.  Having the laundry done by hotel staff is very expensive but I didn't want to tote dirty clothes around for 17 days!!!  And the fees airlines charge for extra or oversized luggage are ridiculous if you try to take the amount of clothing you need for a long trip.This was recommended by a friend and is the perfect compromise!!!  I love Woolite anyway and the sink stopper is a great addition.  I purchased a travel clothesline and pins and now can wash items as I wish anywhere!!  I will continue buying additional as we travel frequently."
1,"I have used this kit three summers in a row to wash my delicates while traveling abroad. The sink stopper is a wonderful invention and tends to work on most tumba and deep sinks. On very small sinks. it will still work but you may notice it does not hold as tight of a seal. The soap packets are a good size. though I typically only use about half of the packet for six or so undergarments. As long as I fold down the top of the packet. the rest of the Woolite stays inside. The Woolite is easy to wash out and leaves my clothes clean and soft. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone going on a trip who may need to do an emergency load of laundry!"
1,"I bought this as well as the Carson Pendant magnifier. The lenses are both the same size.For starters. the GT 532 took 12 days to receive it! The Carson arrived in two days. Both ordered the same time...I recently had cataract surgery and opted to have my nearsightedness corrected. which left me unable to see anything closer than about 4'. I bought an assortment of reading glasses from Walmart. as well as these two magnifiers. just to get by for the moment.If I had to pick one or the other. the Carson is the winner. It is less bulky. and IMO. allows me to see better. with or without glasses.It has a better case as well. I will keep this for those moments when I forget what I did with the Carson Pendant magnifier.I also bought a lighted. free standing/handheld. 5x Carson FH-25 magnifier at Walmart for $13. I have not found any better product than what Carson has to offer."
1,"The battery was exactly what I needed. it was not outdated and arrived quickly.  I sometimes find it difficult to locate the right button battery when one is needed; seems there is no rhyme or reason given to battery names.  When I open a product to see what is needed. I look up the battery number online and frequently get hits on batteries that do not even come close to resembling the one I have.  I am not sure why button batteries have so many different equivalent names. but I have included some below for this battery in the hopes it will help someone else.A76 equivalent batteries:  1128MP. 1166A. AG13. D76A. G13A. GPA7. GPA76. LR44. LR1154. L1154. PX675A. PX76A. RPX675. S76. V13GA. 357A. RW82. KA. A76. 208-904. SB-F9. G13-A. CA18. CA19. LR44. A-76. 76A"
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
1,"I had purchased (on Amazon) a battery operated remote door bell which I added to my front door.  Needless to say. the little 12 volt battery that came with the doorbell was an unknown brand and didn't last very long.  I could not locate the replacement battery in my local area grocery and drug stores.  I looked on Amazon and sure enough. they had them available!  I was especially pleased the batteries were Energizer. exactly the type I needed. and was a two-pack!  I really do tell my friends that if they can't find something. or if they do and it's too expensive or too far to drive to get it. look on Amazon!"
1,"I thought I was going to get the exact blister pack that was pictured but it wasn't. instead I got the retail single blister packs where the batteries are made in China.  Both work but the twin blister packs are made in the USA and lasts at least 50% longer. next time I'll ask the seller if they are selling this exact blister pack or if they are selling the 2nd rate single retail blister packs.  I won't return it for a few dollars but I would have paid an extra 2 bucks to get the originals with an expiration date printed.  I hope this helps potential buyers of this product."
1,"You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like. but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless. these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries. let's just give this power-packing. very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!"
1,"This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++. would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet. so I am not sure on the quality. I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know . because I did the hard ground-level research. opening the controller. finding the battery. removing the battery. examining the battery. finding the name of the battery. replacing the battery. closing the battery containment area. and so on."
1,"I bought theEnergizer ECR2032 Watch Batteryfor our bathroom scale. and expected it to last a year or more. like the original battery did. However. it is weakening after only a few months. I bought the battery December 2009. but it had a manufacturing date of July 2009. Could it be that the battery was too old? Is this short lifespan a problem with the battery in general. or these batteries in particular? I don't know.At this price. though. I cannot complain too much. Free shipping with Amazon Prime makes this an incredibly good deal. so I ordered another one. Hopefully. it will last a bit longer. The packaging this time is different (not the same as the picture shown). but the battery is still old--February 2010."
1,"I had to get a new battery for my XM radio remote control. This was the size I needed. but I never thought about getting it on Amazon. I went to the drug store and paid over $5.00 for the same battery. When I went home to install it I thought I would just check to see if Amazon had one online. Sure enough. I bought this one and took the one I purchased from the drug store back for a refund. I even told the counter person that I had to return it due to the price. So far the battery works just fine."
1,"I have an old APC UPS that uses this battery. and every 2-3 years. the battery dies.  I always replace it with a genuine APC battery because then I get free mail-in recycling.  I wouldn't know what to do with my old battery otherwise.One way you can tell if it's genuine APC is if it includes instructions on how to send the battery back to APC for recycling.  I purchased my batter from 'Amazon.com LLC'. and it is genuine.  I removed the old battery and put the new one in. and my UPS works great now.  I expect it to last another 2-3 years."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
1,"We have 3 of these. and have been pleased since the beginning (about 3 years ago). Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use (though it takes a bit of getting used to. and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while). We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory. but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss (both dead batteries). There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out. I like this latest itineration best. as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom. One word of caution: my family will not travel without these things. so while I preach 'pack light'. they tote their Sonics everywhere we go. Fortunately. one charge lasts at least a week. so the charging base is only needed on extended trips."
1,"Gimmicky tech stuff drives me crazy. but this product is worth every penny you pay for it.  Although you might be used to scrubbing your teeth (and I admit that can be therapeutic at times). the super-charged foam will actually do a much more thorough job of ridding your teeth of plaque.  My oral hygenist said that use of the Sonicare has made my normally very good-looking gums fabulously heatlhy.  I'm another person that wishes I had had one years ago; it may have helped me prevent the loss of a tooth.My oldest son's orthodontist gave him a Sonicare. because they believe it is the most effective toothbrush for cleaning teeth with braces.  We're buying another for my younger son. as he now has a retainer. The sensation of using it may be a little unusual at first. but you will quickly become used to it.  Believe me. you want this product!"
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
1,"The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners). and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing. but they simply get cleaner. More important. my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless. and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges. and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean. quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However. it's worth it for better dental and gum health."
1,"Excellent product but a little pricy. relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver. then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver. to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades. unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!"
1,"I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then. when trying to get the lather to come out slowly. you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable. but doesn't really burn. The lather. itself. comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not. I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face."
1,"After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product."
1,"I've used an Oral B since 1993. and am on my 3rd one. The first one finally 'burned' out a few years ago. and the 2nd one I somehow left in a motel room. and it conveniently got 'lost' (hope the maid is enjoying it). as when I called that afternoon. 'nothing had been found'...These cannot be beat. Like many other reviewers have said. the dentist's ALWAYS notice the difference when people switch to these.Personally. I always brush on high speed until it beeps. then I switch to low speed. and re-brush. and then go onto my gums and tongue before stopping.A Great Tool. from a Reliable Mfg.. Not to be Beaten! If you've not used one of these. by all means. GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF ONE. NOW!! You'll NEVER regret it! ~operabruin"
1,"B000050FDE: Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush  Am pleased as punch with this dental device. which puts others to shame.  In fact. the soniCare 1126 corpse that it replaced is patiently waiting for proper disposal.  I don't know if toothbrushes have chemicals in them which would pollute the environment if given half a chance.   I don't recall when the Philips soniCare was first used. but even at first brush. it never performed as well for me as the Oral-B.  Different strokes for different folks.   This Gold Box item leaves my mouth feeling super clean each time I use it. and I particularly like the double-head brushes.  Thank you. Amazon. for making this available to me at an 'irreteethable' price."
1,"This is my second electric toothbrush.  I upgraded this time based on a recommendation and have to say it lives up to it's description.  When fully charged - it will take you through an extra long vacation without re-charging. I like the smaller brush that allows you to get around bridge work and between teeth. and that it lets you know when you've done 2 minutes worth (started out determined to always do this --- think I'm down to a minute -- but teeth and gums look and feel good.) Only thing I'd like is a bigger head on the main brush. so that my minute was covering more teeth area."
1,"I charged it for 18 hours as it requested from the get go. Once I start it up. after about every 15-20 seconds. it hiccups for 1 second.  Not bad of a product.  Feels different since I use less toothpaste now (compared to brushing manually).  I feel like a lazy hygienist now. with the lack of desire to brush my own teeth because the feeling of 'Success!' and 'Clean!' isnt' there anymore.  However. I will use this product until it is dead. I also bought it discounted from the amazon gold box.If there were no hiccups. I'd give it a 4. that's the main defect (with mine at least).  I do like the waterproof-ness. but I don't need it since I don't brush in the shower.-MCUpdate: Upping to 4star"
1,"My dentist scolded me for thrashing my gums by brushing too hard and for having too much plaque. He insisted I get the Braun Oral-B. which he said was the best of its kind. I'm glad I did. The design has a soft mode for people with sensitive gums and it has cut down my plaque. far better than had I used a conventional toothbrush. Also the device is easy to use and maintain so I'm confident I'll use it consistently. Finally. I must say my teeth feel far more clean and smooth now. The Braun no doubt will have prevented me from getting some serious dental work."
1,"Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner. and the vibration is enjoyable as well.The battery life is great. however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don't need it to be fully charged to use it.The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.As far as replacement heads. I went with theGeneric Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.). They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.Highly recommend this powered tooth brush."
1,"I had the older version of this from a couple of years back. and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband. and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one. and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.For the price I paid. though. it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions."
1,"I bought this for my husband because he really liked the idea of a self-cleaning razor.  It worked okay for a month or so and then broke.  He sent it in for repair and it came back working properly.  A few months later. it broke again. Again it was fixed.  Props to customer service for this.Since we were already going broke paying for the cleaning solutions. when it broke a third time. we decided it wasn't worth the hassle and bought a different one."
1,"There is a newer offering from braun which I also have. The 7526 razor has been around for several years now and is by far the best one ever made. I have had mine for well over 7 years now and it still works like a champ! I have had to replace the foil and blade twice and the replacements are for sale on amazon. I accidently plugged the cord into only one slot on a power strip and it ruined the power cord so I thought I would 'upgrade' to the newest version. The newer razor did not shave as good as my trusty old one. So I purchased a power cord and I have since packed the new one away in the attic. I'll never give up this razor! It holds a great charge and I am still using the original battery."
1,"I've used Braun razors for over 25 years. and while this model isn't as good as some of the older simpler models. it still works fine. It's great to be able to purchase screens and cutting blocks on Amazon as it's hard to find these in local drug stores. Thanks for providing such great service and just for being there Amazon!By the way. Braun has a great. simple little battery-powered travel shaver that I now use as my main shaver. and then I use my older model for the side trimmer. The little guy is only about $15 and does a great job. and even has its own rotating screen cover. Very neat."
1,"This razor has been pretty crappy to me.  I got it as a Christmas gift about 1 1/2 years ago.  After about 1 year. the foil got a tear in it. so I paid $26 and got the replacement pack (turns out Braun doesn't sell just the foil anymore).  About 6 months after I bought the replcement. the foil got another tear in it.  Now it nicks me every time I use it.  It does a nice job. but it is crap for $30. spend a little extra and get a better razor."
1,"The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers. which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they've got you as a customer. they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's. not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)  I'd try a Norelco or Remington. but I think they're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company (Gillette?).  I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel--or trying a Panasonic."
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
1,"Although the part numbers have changed over the years. this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge. and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)"
1,"I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore. and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit. and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment). and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these. but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer."
1,"Have been using these Braun Clean & Renew Refills for several years now.  They do a good job of helping to clean the razor (after you get rid of the hair debris).  Used to purchase them at various stores especially if I could find them on sale. which was almost never.  I have watched their prices continue to go up & up.  Then one day I found them on Amazon at their Subscribe & Save area at a cheaper price. especially because this package comes with 3 refills which is a money saver.  The only negative comment I will make is that once opened. each refill only last about 30 days -- sure wish Braun could figure out a way to make them last a little longer."
1,"Sure. you can run your shaver head under the faucet to clean out the whiskers.  The alcohol in these cartridges also disinfect your shaver foil and blades.  That's important since you are shaving so close with the Braun you are bound to get unnoticeable micro cuts that might harbor harmful bacteria.  The auto clean function works surprisingly well also.  I tested it by not shaving for three days and then shaved and stuck it on auto clean.  After the cycle was done. I pulled the head and inspected.  Spotless!  That is very impressive.  The Braun engineers deserve kudos for their innovations and making the world's best shaver."
1,"I use this with a Braun 8000 series activator (8585 I think). They are expensive (so is the shaver) but the system does work.  The first one lasted over 5 months. using it every 2 to 3 days on average.  No evaporation loss that I could tell.  You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it but I am not sure that is within warrantee. etc.  I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner. so that made it clean and fresh.  However. when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary.  One thing to note is that you cannot take this on a plane - even if you check luggage.I am sensitive to smells. but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose."
1,"These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not. so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly. then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system."
1,"At first I thought that a self-cleaning razor was gimmicky. but after owning for several years now I think that this function is highly useful and that it keeps the expensive razor and blades in decent condition.  My one complaint about the refills is that because they are alcohol based product. it evaporates. so if you shave infrequently and therefore clean infrequently. the product does not last for very long.  The idea of removing the cartridge and capping is decent. but seems like more of an hassle than it's worth."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
1,"I've been a user of Braun electric shavers for over 5 years. I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean & Renew cartridges have a shorter life span. from about 3 months to less than 2 months. not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point. I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I'm the only one. but so far I give it only 3 stars because of thisBut the Frustrarion Free Pack is great. it greatly reduces the amount of useless cardboard and excess material. Good job there!"
1,"These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use. and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned. not sure why that is. Amazon 'subscribe and save' is a great way to save money on this product. since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience."
1,"I've been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints. The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is. Less cardboard waste than the old packaging. and a better price per cartridge.To make the cartridges last longer. re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use. I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so. and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it's kept capped to prevent evaporation."
1,"The clean and renew system works very well. at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time. and to improve the 'feel' of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month. and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a 'heavy' cleaning.  The system obviously has a 'cost' associated with the refills. but overall. it seems to be worthwhile."
1,"These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old. and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time. so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life. I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy."
1,"This product is used to clean and lubricate your Braun electric razors. They are reasonably priced and last a good amount of time. They have a lemon-alcohol kind of scent to them which I have grown to really like. These really work too. Sometimes when I don't get a chance to order extras and don't clean my razor for a few days I can really feel the difference. Shaving is much more painful because the razor starts to pull your hair more instead of clipping it.Don't get too complacent through. I would still recommend occasionally taking a brush and air can to the razor to get it extra clean."
1,"Braun's cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day. You just have to decide if it's worth paying about $5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you. For me. it is. I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the 'on' button after shaving and walking away. knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it. When I travel. I don't bring the cleaning unit. so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day. which (a) takes a few minutes. and (b) isn't as effective as the cleaning unit. So it's four stars. withholding one star just for the price."
1,"This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads 'low' I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3. but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large. smashed. under-protected box. the 5 stars is for the quality product. convenience. and ease of use. Very easy to insert. use. and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL."
1,"I received a Braun shaver for Xmas last year and looked around for refills to keep the shaver clean.  We even thought of refilling ourselves but after the first try. this was not the ideal solution to using the refills.  We found these at Walmart for a good price but then when those refills were almost gone. I searched for a better price.  The Amazon automatic supply system for refilling these ended up being the best price anywhere and. with free shipping and scheduled shipments. this is one less thing we have to concern ourselves with.  Great product -- excellent value."
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
1,"I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol. but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean. smooth and fresh shave. get this and change timely."
1,"Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each. this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target. Walmart. etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh. lemony. sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each. which helps to increase the value and lower the cost."
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
1,"I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while. long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in. it must have been about two months ago. it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year. not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth."
1,"I bought these for my friend. who needed refills for his Braun shaver system...I told him that he'd be better off getting them through me because I can get it in 2 days with my Prime Membership--and they'd be cheaper than the drugstore prices.I was right about the drugstore price comparison.However--when they didn't show up in 2 days. I called Amazon.  It turns out that the shippers require that these be sent regular-speed (something about Hazardous Materials). so it took 10 days to get here.  You cannot order these with the 2 day shipping.As far as the quality--they are the refills that are designed for the unit. and work just perfectly as expected.The Braun Shaver Systems rule :)  According to my friend. at least ;)"
1,"I've been using my Braun shaver and the refills for almost a year and a half. Like others. I thought the refills might last longer by cleaning my razor every other use. I eventually realized that the refill didn't last any longer. so now I use the cleaning function after each use. I get a fresh shaver for each use and feel as though I'm getting my money's worth from the refills. One note...I always save the cap/top of the refill. If you're planning on being away from your cleaning unit for several days or more. you should cap the refill. You're refill will last longer as you won't lose any fluid to evaporation."
1,"I find that cleaning the Braun shaver in the cleaning base with this solution just a couple of times a week is enough.  If you snap the cap back on the cartridge between uses. you can slow down the evaporation and make the cartridge last at least two months.  The bright blue solution will slowly turn gray from the accumulated whisker debris.  When it gets ugly enough. and when the level of liquid starts to get low from evaporation during use. you'll use your own judgement about when to start a new one."
1,"I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though. buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave."
1,"I've been using a Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges for over two years.  They are worth the money---the shaver is clean and glides over my face for each shave.For what it is worth. I'll add a comment that the Braun 8985 Series 5 shaver itself is one of the best-engineered products I have ever encountered. I'm always finding flaws in electronics. etc.  The Braun seems to defy me!!Some have complained about the price of the cartridges.  They are worth it as I have said.  You can keep the shaver clean by following directions to 'vibrate' the hair clippings out and then use a brush---I've done this on trips of up to one month with great success. but that isn't like using the cleaner mechanism with liquid."
1,"I have the Braun 8585 razor; see my review there for my thoughts on that.I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.Best of all. it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the 'normal' light is on. or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.  That's a bargain to me.  No more brushes or hot running water!  Now if only the razor did a better job..."
1,"I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that)."
1,"Having switched from a long time Braun user to a Norelco Sensotouch 3D I still have my 790cc Braun. When P&G; bought out Braun they discontinued the foil and cutter block with a generic that pales in comparison to Braun Optifoil. I switched to the Norelco and the cleaning system system is a marvel.However I still prefer my old Braun and was lucky enough to have bought extra foils prior to them being phased out. The Braun clean and renew system is still in my opinion the best there is. The solution strips the blades and foil of all gunk. oils and whiskers - it's like a brand new razor every morning.This is a great deal on a 4 pack of refills. Plus if you have a Prime membership you get Free two day shippin to boot. The frustration free packaging is a real plus and cuts down on waste - I choose it whenever it's available."
1,"These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this. I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning. raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call. I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can."
1,"The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more. the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store. and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change)."
1,"Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs. this product may be your solution. By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution. I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps. While the shave isn't as close as premium blades. the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.Two tips: 1) I  recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution. Occasionally. I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving2) Prevent evaporation -- consistently leaving the saver in the stand will help preserve the volatile solution more effectively.  If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal. covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help."
1,"There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday. once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer. it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year."
1,"There's not too much to say about these...they do what they're supposed to!  I clean my razor using the self-cleaning system nearly every day and it really amazes me how clean the razor comes out.  Not only is it clean. but it's lubricated and smells nice.  It truly does feel like you're using a brand new razor every day.  There are lots of reviews on here complaining that the stuff doesn't last long enough. but I find that they last about a month if you use them fairly regularly. and that's about what I'd expect from them.  Sure. you can only use them once a week. seal them in between uses. and make them last a lot longer.  But. I don't find them overpriced and I like that my razor is clean and fresh every day.  It's much faster than thoroughly cleaning the razor yourself. and works better than just using a brush and water."
1,"You open your Braun cleaning station. slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor. it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China. filled with alcohol. coloring. and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?"
1,"I've been using a Braun Syncro shaver system for quite some time. and have always used the Clean & Renew refills to keep my shaver clean. lubricated. and ready to go for the next shave.  Cleaning with these isn't a necessity. but it does take away the chore of having to do it myself.The cost of these. in my opinion. is worth the price for a smooth shave every time without any fuss of having to take the shaver apart to clean it. or having to remember to make sure to lubricate the blades as frequently - plus the lemon scent is a nice added bonus!"
1,"Supposedly this keeps the blades clean and sharp. It sure seems to work. But after about 1-1.5 months. the fluid seems to stop working regardless of how many times you've used it to clean the razor.So plan on buying more than a few of these. For certain it really cleans the razor and so far the blades are only about half as dull as they normally would be. So a big plus. but I really don't like having to buy all these accessories and you can't travel with these as they are flammable. I wonder how just plain alcohol would work instead as it'd be a lot cheaper. Just bring an empty container and fill it with alcohol?I'd like it if these refills weren't flammable so I could take them on the plane and also if they were cheaper. and lasted longer than a month."
1,"I have used this product for years. I don't have a heavy beard. and sometimes I shave in the shower. so I usually don't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine. I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time. but to me this is just a cost of maintenance (like periodically changing the oil in my car). Also. if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product (like when I go away on vacation for a week). I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product."
1,"First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily. you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks"
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
1,"Not much that I can say other than the price of these is much better on Amazon so I get them here. The product works great and keeps my razor in top condition. The only thing I have noticed is that once a razor is a few years old I think the product starts to wear the painting / coating on the plastic. Mine razor has started to discolor a little as well as bubble / peel near the area the cleaner hits. Really this is a non-issue. most razors I have had that cost well over $200 dont even seem to last that long. just figured I would mention it. Not much you can do really. you have to clean the razors and these cartridges are what most require in some form."
1,"I purchased my Bruan shaver with clean system about 8 years ago.  I use to be able to go to Walmart and purchase the refills. but here lately Walmart has not had them in stock.  So I had to go online to find them and of course Amazon did.  Not only was the refills cheaper. but instead of getting a 2 refill pack I was able to get a 3 refill pack cheaper than what Walmart sold with only 2 in their package.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who own a Braun shaver with a cleaning system."
1,"I prefer this ear thermometer to my other one. The need for a lens filter may turn off some buyers. but I like it for the fact that they keep the lens clean and ready to use. The case the thermometer snaps into holds the filters for easy to reach convenience.The thermometer gets accurate readings quickly and easily. It only takes a second. My other ear thermometer took longer and I could never aim it just right. The other one also doesn't have a lens filter. which made it more inconvenient because I always had to make sure it was clean and then hunt down the alcohol to clean it with.This thermometer is tops in my book. I highly recommend it."
1,"I have a number of Homedics products from the full body massager to handheld. to a neck thing and love all of them.  They are great.  While at Goodwill on $1 Thursdays. I picked up this foot massager for $1.  It works great.  All the good and bad stuff about this from the reviews - it vibrates too much. moves all over the floor. etc.  Yes. it does all those.The heat works great.  The vibration works great. though. I would keep the vibration thing on for probably more than 5-10 min.  I feel my whole body vibrating.  Anyway. I keep this under my desk with a big towel under it to keep it from slipping too much.  For $1?  I couldn't even get a $1 burger from McDonald's for less expensive.Great buy and find for me."
1,"For the price. this product isn't that bad. but don't expect too much from it.  The 'massage' basically amounts to it vibrating a lot. which can feel somewhat nice. but not as much as I had expected.  As a runner. I've tried many different foot massagers and this one is on the slightly below average end.  The unit also doesn't put off much heat at all.  You can get more heat from sticking your feet near a light bulb.However. being able to control the product with my toes was fairly nice. and I do use it occasionally.  I just don't think it should have been labeled as a'Pro Ultra.'  There's nothing really 'ultra' about it."
1,"I used to stay in hotels 4 nights of the week when working out of town. Nothing worse for good sleep than noise. a strange place. and jetlag. If you get a smoking room or a stale-smelling room. it can be really be pretty bad. I used to put the television on a non-channel for the white noise (blocks traffic. elevators and voices a bit) and burn scented candles for the odors.The Homedics device is a lot better than burning a candle and having the TV on all night. I love the woodlands sounds and aromatherapy sure works for me (and certainly gets rid of that &quot;hotel&quot; smell as well.)If you travel or know someone who has to be on the road. this is a great thing to take with. And if you have a fussy baby. sometimes it can help (although I lent one recently to a friend with a colicky kid but he still preferred to be in a car. driven round and round and round and....)"
1,"Aleve helps me for my back pain but doesn't seem to help with most common everyday things like headaches.I alternate between Tyenol and Aleve. When one stops working. I switch back to the other. This is just about the same as Tyenol. Aleve may be a little bit better but it is more expensive.I would recommend this if you take Tyenol and it has stopped helping because your body has become adjusted to it. Aleve seems to be harder on the stomach so be sure to take with food.Another reviewer said it helped with her menstrual pains but it doesn't help me with mine. This does help me better than Tyenol with lower back pain."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
1,"The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell. but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator. which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack. which feels like hot lava."
1,"I didn't find that this worked very well for my arthritis (osteo). but it DOES work wonderfully on mosquito bites. especially if you use it on the bites as soon as you notice them. To me. it's worth it's weight in gold for just that reason. I purchasedAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid. Original. with No-Mess Applicator - 4 fl oz. then theAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid. Original - 16 fl ozto refill the bottle. I will purchase again next summer when those pesky critters come back.My husband doesn't like the smell. but I don't mind it at all ... and I don't care since it works!  :D"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
1,"Its pretty good. its a lot like icy hot.  I guess I thought it would be stronger though.  Im using it on a sprained neck thats very painful so I didnt expect it to knock this kind of pain out completely but it helps ease the tension a bit.  My only complaint is it REALLY stinks.  Someone across the room from me at work asked me if I was eating a tunafish sandwich..lol.  It smells like tuna and kinda like rubber a little.  The smell makes me nausea after 3 days of use.  I never want to smell it again if my neck EVER heals..."
1,"Absorbine Jr. is one of best 'old fashioned'. now. sadly little known products on market.I do use several 'legacy' type products still including Absorbine Jr. Cornhusker's LotionPfizer Consumer Healthcare Corn Huskers Lotion 7 Oz&Corn Huskers Heavy Duty Oil-Free Hand Treatment Lotion 7 fl oz (207 ml)and Bag BalmBag Balm Antiseptic. 10 ozWhile not quite as effective on muscle aches to me as some other products like Icy Hot. it is still good and is fantastic on athlete's foot problems (burns like hades. but clears up mine in 2-3 days) and works extremely well on insect bites and plant sticker punctures and irritations.  Kids may howl and complain as it can BURN on broken skin / abrasions. but it works better than most of today's fancy (and expensive) products and does not have an perfumes or fragrances added.  It acts. works and SMELLS like a 'medicine'."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."
1,"The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the product label is misleading.  It's just not for athlete's foot. it's also good for jock itch.  My derm told me that there's no difference between this powder and the one that's labeled &#34;jock itch&#34;.  It's deceiving because the prices are different. whether intentionally or not. it does not matter. consumers shouldn't have to deal with the confusion.  This product gets the job done quickly and easily.  I can't find a better medical powder out there."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist. 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review"
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
1,"I have chronic anemia and am periodically on oxygen. and have developed nearly daily nosebleeds. My hematologist gave me a sample of Ayr because I was in so much pain from the cracking and irritation. I could hardly touch my nose. After a few days using it. my nostrils were actually *flexible* without being too painful again! I still get nosebleeds but if I keep up with using the Ayr as needed. I don't have the burning dryness. it doesn't hurt to touch the sides of my nose and I can blow my nose (believe me. that's an achievement).I purchased theAyr Saline Nasal Gel Moisturizing Swabs With Soothing Aloe. 20-Count Swabsto tuck in my purse when I'm out. since this is Wisconsin and it's drier than a bone here in the winter.This is better than the entire pile of saline-only mists. treatments and sprays I've been advised to use."
1,"As my husband and I have gotten older we have had increasing nasal dryness during the winter.  For a few years we have been using Boroleum at bedtime.  The Boroleum is quite helpful -- but it is viscous and smells awful.  It is basically petrolatum and camphor.  Really do not want to be using it during the day.  My husband discovered this Ayr saline nasal gel -- it is very light. liquid. and unscented.  We find we need to use it several times a day but it has become indispensable.  If I forget to reapply it my nose quickly becomes dry and painful.  It almost doesn't seem possible that this simple and inexpensive salve could work so well.  We have bought so many tubes of this and it is now one of our subscribe and save items.  We are always stocking several tubes as we never want to run out of it."
1,"This was a multi-box deal. The expiration was far enough away in years that I will easily use them all. I suffer from dry bleeding sinuses in the winter. My doctor recommended vasaline; that was a one time nightmare. I tried a generic of this from CVS and liked it. and then found this product for less than the generic. It helps ease the pain of dry nasal passages. help stop the nasal prescription spray from giving me nose bleeds. and coupled with netti pot. saline rinse. and two vaporizers. my nose has been happy and sinus infection free for two months. I will buy more for sure!"
1,"It's so soothing to the insides of my nose. Some types of weather makes my nose very dry and the AYR helps a lot. When my nose get too dry it might bleed when I blow it but because of the AYR it doesn't bleed as often. The only thing is that you will need Q-tips to apply the AYR. You could use your fingers but I wouldn't. You never know what's under them. no matter how much you wash your hands. I would recommend this to any one with this problem."
1,"I have been using Ayr Nasal Gel for the past two years at bed time and have found that it keeps my nasal passages open throughout the night and it has eliminated the stuffiness I had before discovering this product.  I buy it in quantity from Amazon and save substantially from retail pharmacy's.  I can't recommend it more highly. especially after this winter.  Since it has been unseasonably cold making keeping adequate humidity in the home next to impossible with humidifiers and even warm mist vaporizors. Ayr Nasal Gel has provided relief that otherwise would of made my sleeping through the night extremely difficult. A small amount at the bottom of each nostril is all one needs to use and a tube will last for a reasonable time making it a cost effective means verses nasal strips."
1,"If you live in an arid area of the country and are prone to nosebleeds. this is just the ticket. It is a pleasant gel that keeps your nasal tissues from drying out and bleeding. The person I bought this for had massive hemorrhages and was usually far from medical help. Since she started using this. not a single nosebleed. When she can't get to 'the big city' drug stores. I know I can always depend on Amazon to back her up.This product comes in fine spray. gel spray. and gel tubes. I prefer the two later items myself. but even the fine spray or a saline spray helps."
1,"During Utah's dry winters. I experience daily nose bleeds.  I've tried saline nose spray and humidifiers.  After a particulary bad nose bleed lasting almost 24 hours. I researched other treatments.  I had nothing to loose from trying the Ayr gel.  THIS STUFF WORKS!  I haven't had nose bleeds since using the product.  I wish I would have known about it years ago.  But two instructions for best success:1.  Put the get on the tip of the finger (not the bottom) and rub it all around INSIDE the nose & up as high as you can get it. (make sure your fingernail is cut short).2.  Look at your nose in the mirror about an hour later - sometimes there will be white stuff visible.  You want to make sure you don't gross people out.3.  I have to use the product twice daily to prevent all bleeds.This product changed my life; no more daily bleeds!"
1,"In the past our ENT recommended we use Ayr Saline Nasal Gel.  Our ENT said the Ayr gel would keep our noses from getting overly dry.  He said this would help prevent us from getting so many sinus infections.  He also suggested we each use a Neti Pot and saline solution.  As the doctor pointed out. you can keep Ayr gel with you at all times. but you cannot always keep a Neti Pot with you.I don't know why. but we sneeze almost each time we apply the Ayr gel.  The sneezing last for a few seconds and then the sneezing stops.  The Ayr gel moisturizes our nasal cavities. which helps us to have fewer nosebleeds.Amazon and Wal Mart charge the same price for the Ayr gel. but when we go to Wal Mart. they are often out of stock.  I was glad to find it here at Amazon.  When I bought it from Amazon. Amazon had temporarily lowered their price."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel. With Soothing Aloe. 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day. and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists. and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well. delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray. and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)"
1,"I ordered this when I couldn't find the 4-Way saline spray at a decent price.These probably work well for you if you want to use them as drops or dont mind a stream type delivery.I dont like the feel of the stream compared to the mist type so I probably wouldn't order again for that reason.I had trouble with it dripping from my nose as I was squeezing the bottle where as the mist type doesnt do this.Since I dont like leaning my head back to use nasal spray its not a good product for me personally.The product itself is fine overall.I dont like the longer.skinny tip compared to the short.wider.type on the 4-Way.Very good price for six large bottles though."
1,"I suffer from year round allergies with nasal congestion constantly. This saline mist is the best I have tried. It is not drying like the others. The spray bottle is easy to use and gives off a nice mist spray. not alot of fluid just to run back out your nose. I have purchased other spray bottles that were so hateful to use such as the spray hole too small. or the bottle loses it's shape making it hard to squeeze. etc. This mist does the job I need it to to moisten and help clear my nose..sorry gross. Great price here at Amazon also. I'll be buying it again."
1,"I bought these in a pack of 6 using Amazon Prime and considered it a great deal.  I need saline spray after having a septoplasty 4 weeks ago and this saline rinse fits the bill.The shape of the bottle and the nozzle are better engineered than Ocean (in my opinion).  This bottle provides a nice. gentle spray.  Great stuff and very good at moisturizing the mucosa.  Does what it was meant to do.I used this heavily after a septoplasty surgery and also imagine it would be good for those using a CPAP machine dealing with dry noses.  I prefer this over Ocean and some of the other saline sprays because the bottle format is actually nice and delivers a very consistent mist of saline.  The 'fatter' ocean bottles always feel like they get squeezed in the middle and become more difficult to use as the bottle gets emptier.I like this brand the best -- great stuff!"
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
1,"For some years I've had repeated sinus infections.  Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive.  I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray. it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the 'job' for me!"
1,"For someone who always has had troubles with her sinuses. I'm a big fan of nasal sprays.  For some reason. I can not get used to a Netti pot. just the sensation of water makes me gag immediately.  I've tried a lot of sprays. and my past favorite Rhinaris is wonderful. but expensive.  Plus. often it would get a little stale and smelled almost to a point of curdled milk if left unused for a while.  I like Ayr because of a low price on amazon.And here's a great tip. if you take care of the bottle and rinse the tip under hot water after every use [as per directions]. it never gets stale. always fresh smelling. which really means no smell at all.  I usually do 3 sprays in each nostril. which I find does a fine job."
1,".Recently I have been on oxygen most of each day.  Although the oxygen helps the condition for which it was prescribed. it drys my nasal membranes.  So I get frequent nosebleeds.  Sometimes the nosebleeds cut off access to the oxygen.One of my therapists suggested I try Ayr products.  I found that Ayr produces a gel. nose drops. and a mist.  I decided upon the mist.Ayr Saline Nasal Mist is very helpful.  When my nose begins to bleed I spray the mist into my nose and it stops the bleeding.  My doctor explained that the sodium chloride in the mist helps form blood clots.I recommend Ayr Saline Nasal Mist for anyone struggling with nosebleeds."
1,"After my five year old started suffering really bad allergies this spring I used children's Zyrtec. It worked but made my son feel 'weird' and he didn't like it. So I tried Clariton but it did nothing. So I search for something that didn't have side effects and found this. I was drawn to it by the good reviews I found all over the web. Well after 2 days of use my son is allergy free! I can't believe it and I'm so happy! I'm thinking about switching myself from my Rx steroid spray.It's such a happy moment when you find something that works and it safe.If you suffer or know someone that does. please try this product. It rocks!"
1,"What a great little design that fits into your pocket just like a chapstick. No matter how stuffy I get. those Vicks vapors clear me right up allowing me to use my nasal spray to keep the airways clear. There are two things you should definitely avoid with this product. First. you should not over use the inhaler. as it will cause nasal irritation. Second. you should store the inhaler at room temperature because if it gets too hot the vapors will be stronger and also cause nasal irritation. The only other concern is that this product has an ingredient that will show up as an amphetamine on a drug test. So. you should keep the card with you if your boss gives you a drug test. If you follow these guidelines. then you'll see this product is a real lifesaver when you're all stuffed up."
1,"This is a product that is intended to cure/treat an illness/disease. and HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO BE SAFE OR EFFECTIVE BY THE FDA!  *** ALL *** of these foreign medications/foods being sold on Amazon are ILLEGAL ...  Where are you Amazon?  This is a crime.This is a medication made by India (or wherever) for India (or wherever). IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE SOLD IN THE USA!  Wake up people - you have no idea of the conditions in developing countries. no idea of the quality of their source materials. their hygiene. their regulatory enforcement. etc.  I was almost killed by a substituted medication from Mexico.  Don't be an idiot.  If you wouldn't allow a stranger to inject you with a syringe containing an unknown substance. don't eat/inhale unknown substances either. because it is no different than being injected."
1,"Thanks to this little stick. I don't have to fight with my gag reflex due to the horrific smells of my fellow airline passengers who fart up a storm as we fly across the oceans and lands of our vast planet. Out of pure necessity did I buy this product and 10 years later I still never travel without it. I've never used it for anything other than keeping offensive odors away from my nasal passages.I'd rather spray the offenders with Lysol but since that's no longer chic or eco friendly. this little gem works amazingly well. Plus. the Vapo Inhaler is US TSA friendly."
1,"Decongestant pills deliver the drug to your whole body. so they can cause side effects in your whole body. This inhaler delivers the drug straight to your nose. just where you want it. I find these inhalers more effective than pills. much faster. and with fewer side effects.Decongestant pills usually contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine. both of which are stimulants - basically speed. I have tried pseudoephedrine pills and I find they cause insomnia and anxiety. I have not even tried phenylephrine pills. Decongestant pills tend to increase heart rate and blood pressure. and can cause chest pain (angina) in some people. A closely related decongestant. phenylpropanolamine (PPA). was withdrawn from the US market because it caused stroke. However. it should be noted that the stroke victims were generally taking very high doses as a weight-loss aid. they were not using decongestant doses.This inhaler contains a very similar stimulant drug. but the dose is very low and it stays mostly in your nose."
1,"I had a Cold and I couldn't breathe my nose was all stuffed up so I order Vicks Vapor Inhaler. for some reason there are no where to be found where I live. It arrived in just two days. Amazing. with the Vicks Vapors you get instant relief. in just a matter of seconds my nose cleared up real good. One of the best over-the-counter Medicine for Sinus Congestion that really works. I have used it for years. I decided to order another one and for some reason I'm still waiting for it and it's been over a month. I think everyone had the same Idea! ...Thank You D.D."
1,"I sweat if it's hot or cold!!! This is the only thing that works for me!!!!! I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS!!!! Buy this!!! Just DO NOT use after a shower when you have shaved your arm pits it will bun you. At first it does tingle with applications but after a while your skin gets use to it. I did have a rash/burn looking after first application. But using it when I did not just come out of the shower and/or shaving it works best!"
1,"Purchased this for my adult son who has excess sweating; he was so grateful; 'He was like Mom it really does work. thank you!'  Sometimes moms have to research products for adult children as they are where we were years ago. raising young children. working and just don't have the time to get helpful information that will solve their problems.  Anyway. it worked for him...Be sure that whom ever uses this product. that the directions are read carefully as it is not to be used like a deodorant.1. Use at night before bed (do this twice in a row)2. Then use every other nightDon't quote me verbatim. just read the direction for yourself before using. as I'm sure you would like to get the best use from this product.  If it does not work for you see your physician for a stronger version of this product...Good Luck!"
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
1,"I've spent soooooo much money on other products that never helped me :(This actually works!!! I was actually checking in the mirror through out the day to see if I found any sweat & it was completely dry. even after being outside & sweating my underarm area was DrY!!!!! It's watery when putting it on but dries pretty fast & may itch a little at first but it goes away. Trust me if you have embarrassing sweating arm pit stains on your shirt this is Worth it!!! Wish I would have know about it along time ago. But happy to finally find one that keeps me DRY!!! :)"
1,"I saw a TV commercial for this. I thought it wouldn't work so I got it from Walmart so I could easily take it back if it didn't.  IT WORKED.  Now I'm getting it from Amazon after this bottle runs out.It's not that it hides odor any better. it's that it stops wetness better.It's no secret about the aluminum ingredients.  The only thing keeping the mainstream deodorant makers form using the same ingredients is controversy over the effects of aluminum absorption into the system."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
1,"Works but hurts and itches like crazy when you put it on after shaving.  I purchased for wedding as this issue was a big concern for me.  Shaved on Thursday pm in preparation for rehearsal dinner on Friday (since I knew I wouldn't have time to shave on Friday with a huge to-do list). used deodorant on Friday night prior to wedding day.  However. still used another light layer of different kind (a roll-on) over it and had no issues whatsoever the next day.  No. wiping off on his tux or anything.  This was all a HUGE concern of mine too. Everything went perfectly and I didn't have to think about if I smelled or anything at all that day."
1,"1. I was scared that it would sting so badly. and no it's totally bearable and it will go away in a matter of few minutes.2. I once used it all over my body (pits. back. chest). and that was a hot day! And I did sweat a bit. but 90-95% of the sweats were eliminated.NOTE: DON'T use it on large area. not only it will sting really bad the night you apply it. the next day whenever your body trying to sweat it will sting too! BUT if you just use it for underarm alone. everything's fine.3. It lasts for approx. 2-3 days before you'll have to reapply it. Once I used a lot (and by a lot I mean A LOT). it stayed effective for over 5 days!!!4. Instead of rolling it directly to your underarm. you should roll it on your palm. and apply it with your palm so that it won't drip."
1,"If you have profuse sweating problems. thank the lord. because your problems are over. One swath of this under each arm and you can kiss those sweat rings good-bye. Ok. you won't want to do that. but if you have had that problem for as many years as I have. you may actually do it.The bottle says to use only on underarms. I advise that you follow that. However. I put some on my forehead every couple of days to keep those bothersome sweat beads out of my eyes (I wish I had bushy eyebrows). I have noticed an increase in perspiration on other parts of my body. especially while sleeping. but that is a small price to pay for the benefits."
1,"This is an amazing product. I've went through multiple brands. even tried all sorts of Secret. but nothing worked for me. I don't usually sweat unless I'm nervous. After trying Certain Dri Roll-On. I got rid of everything else I had. This thing is amazing. and you do not need to use it daily. Just apply once every 4-6 days depending on how often you need it. I apply it about once a week. It dries quickly and leaves no stains. Be sure NOT to use it after you have shaven or if you have extra sensitive skin as it could irritate. You can use the solid version if you have sensitive skin. Don't forget to get the A.M. Certain Dri as it gives a refreshing smell for the morning."
1,"For years now. I pretty much had to stick to black shirts since I sweat so much.  A quick Google search turned me on to Certain Dri. so I bought some and gave it a whack.  I put it on every night for 3 nights in a row.  Now I only put it on every 2 or 3 nights. and I have been getting great results!  I switched from using your standard antiperspirants. to a combination of this and regular deodorant.  My white undershirts aren't suffering from the nasty yellow pit-stains that normal antiperspirants cause. and I'm able to wear other shirts now without worrying about having wet armpits. We've had a hot May. and so far June here in Detroit...  I've only had minimal issues with sweat. even when it hits the upper 80's and 90's!  This stuff also seems to work well. even when working out or running!"
1,"Finally. a solution to damp pits!  I previously had horrendous sweating. and had to change anti-perspirants almost weekly.  Nothing had ever worked.  Now. I can put this on once a week. and use my regular stuff daily.  It actually works. and I haven't had a single instance of wet pits since I started using it.  I'm blown away that it took me so long to find this!It does sting a bit at night when you apply it. but it is absolutely worth it for the results."
1,"Tried it for a week and it did nothing. Followed the directions exactly...nothing. Tried applying twice a day...nothing. By the third day I was getting severe irritation. By the fourth day I had what looked like abrasive burns under my arms. This was all with following the direction and then. when it didn't work. the suggestions given by other users of the product such as waiting until fully dry after a shower. only applying before bed as per the directions. applying lightly the first time and more the second application the next night. etc. etc. etc.. I didn't get any noticeable reduction in sweating and now I have chafed pits. Moving on to another product."
1,"If you're looking for a product that is both inexpensive and works well. this is it. It does exactly what it says it does.It's sort of a longer term solution. If you put it on at night it'll last for up to 72 hours. but for me usually wears off around the second day. Put it on every night. you'll never have a problem with sweating.This isn't scented. so if you're looking for scented stuff- you can use something else to put on in the mornings. This strictly only stops the sweating. and it's good at doing it."
1,"I love Certain Dri. I'm not sure I could get along in life without it. When I first started using Certain Dri over a decade ago. I would use it every day. Then. I dropped down to using it every other day after maybe two or three weeks. Now. I feel I only need to give my underarms a few swipes once a week. This is incredible because I used to sweat like a beast. I mean. just sitting down without moving around would make my underarms sweat profusely. Gross. I don't worry about that anymore. I do wish that the product worked on hands. though. I haven't had any success trying to get it to work on my hands. However. that's not how the product is marketed. It is just wishful thinking."
1,"Skip all those &#34;clinical strength&#34; products that are sold by big name brands and just buy this!Certain Dri has helped me SO much. I don't think I could live without it! Ever since middle school I've had problems with underarm perspiration. but not anymore. I've been using this for maybe 8 years now. I used to apply it every singe night before bed. but now I use it about once every other week and its still working! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering. even if you haven't shaved your underarms. it's so uncomfortable and itchy!I really can't express how much I love this. Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida. my underarms are still dry!"
1,"I work out fairly often and have a pretty good physique. I like to wherefairly tight shirts. Before I started using Certain Dri. I generally had to where baggier shirts for fear of wetness. Now I can where them as tight as I want. This stuff is awesome. I put it on every 2nd or 3rd night. On occasion it will itch a little if I put to much on. but not near enough for me to stop using it. I certainly don't recommend using it every night. It wasn't meant to be used that often."
1,"I oversweat notoriously and embarrassingly. none of the OTC products quite cut it and make me go out in confidence. and about 70% of them give me rashes to boot. and Certain Dri proved to be a game-changer.1) It does NOT stop underarm sweating altogether. at least for me. but reduces it so dramatically that your underarms end up staying a lot drier than the rest of your body (sth  I def. Prefer)2) Doesn't cause underarm stains if applied correctly* (read sparingly).3) SAFE on oversensitive skin. again. if applied correctly*.*If you're worried you might've overapplied it. simply wait 30 mins after applying. then using a slightly wet tissue/paper towel. wipe the area application. once. This should clean any excess amount away. and don't worry; it will still work."
1,"I am profuse back sweater and had been using Sweatblock pads with great relief.  However. I wanted to find something easier to apply at less cost.  I assumed since the ingredients were the same that Certain Dri would do the trick.  And it has lots of great reviews.  It's been somewhat of a disappointment.  While I can tell it does prevent some sweating. it doesn't keep me dry to the same extent Sweat block did.  I'll try it a little longer because of the price. but it doesn't do the trick as I had hoped."
1,"The temperature hits one degree above 70 and I sweat like a pig. I drink gallons of water a day.  Thankfully my partner doesn't complain.  Her only complaint is body odor. aka pit stench.  Guess what? If there is no sweat there will be no haven for bacteria and hence no odor. This product works very well for me and has been a godsend.  Now my arm pits are always bone dry.  A little too dry actually.  I usually use a gentle skin lotion in place of daily deodorant.  No complaints from me. my partner or my coworkers.That being said this agitates my sensitive skin a little.  Using every other day helps alleviate that. but it's a worthy price to pay to avoid smelling like a dump and having gross stains all over my expensive shirts."
1,"I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I'd jump into a definite conclusion. I've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now. I bought it at a local pharmacy. wasn't cheap. I followed the instructions and I gotta say that it only helped for the first few applications. After that I started having irritation. itching. skin staining. clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working. But that didn't do it. I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant. Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem. Won't buy it again. it's just wasting money."
1,"I've recently started feeling the affects of lactose intolerance and it has put a serious damper on my food experiences. Most of the time I just go without any lactase supplements and risk the small amounts of dairy that comes with the meal. However. when I go for lattes or cheesecake I practically inhale these. They work amazingly quickly. allowing you to take two and just have at it right away.I'm also a bit self conscious about my intolerance. These are individually packed and come in pretty small wrappings. I hide some in my pocket for those days out and if I ever need some I can just turn around and quickly take a few. Very convenient and very effecti...OMGBRB ICE CREAM TRUCK!"
1,"I have severe lactose intolerance (not an allergy. 'just' intolerant) and I usually use the 'Ultra' form of this product. However. since I used to be okay with the 'Original' strength Lactaid. I thought this might be more economical. even if I had to take multiple tablets. I was wrong. For some reason. these tablets just didn't work for me. even when I took 3 or 4 tablets for something that would be managed by a single 'Ultra' tablet.So. if you are really sensitive to dairy products. then you're better off with 'Ultra' Lactaid. rather than 'Original' Lactaid."
1,"The lactaid product is wonderful for anyone that is lactose intolerant. The lactase supplement helps greatly. But go with the tablets. I bought a box of the chewables. and they are terrible. I take them now just because I paid for a box and want to get my money's worth. And once I finish this box. I will always go with the tabs. Granted. ther are more convenient in a place without water... but at the same time. when would you be eating without any liquid to take it down with? Stick to the tabs. you'll be happier."
1,"man! i wish i knew about this when i was younger! I never knew that there were pills about this to help with lactose intolerance... do you guys know how much i suffered bc of milk when i was young? all that diarrhea? it sucked! One day I was like hmmm what if there are pills we can take for lactose intolerance? And there was! I was eager to try it. I'm partly lactose intolerant and It's not that severe. I only get diarrhea when I eat a lot of dairy but ti's not too bad. I take this whenever I drink milk and it does work. I don't get diarrhea like I use to. Now of course this might not work for you bc everyones body response differently to pills."
1,"Lactose intolerance can be very stressful to deal with. Having to decline food. opportunities to eat because you can't digest is embarrassing and annoying. This solves the problem. Take one with your first bite and you can eat dairy products. It says take another after 45 mins but to be safe I would take it 30 mins after if you continue to eat dairy products.I prefer these to the chewables because I can fit a few in my wallet.If you have an empty stomach. be careful when eating lactose containing foods and drinking lots of liquids at the same time. That is the only time I've ever had issues. I took a bite of bagel with cream cheese and a Lactaid and then chugged a bottle of water. needless to say the Lactaid wasn't able to work very well in my empty stomach filled with water and a bit of cream cheese. my stomach was very upset.I drink the Lactaid milk all the time as well - I really like the whole milk.Great products."
1,"I love ice cream & other dairy products but unfortunately. these pills are the only way I can enjoy them.I've also been recently diagnosed w/ extreme iron overload (I guess having steak everyday for lunch & dinner wasn't a good thing :)). So. now I try to drink milk w/ every meal (esp. if meat is involved). At home. it's no problem since I have access to Lactose-free milk. but at restaurants. you don't have that option so Lactaid pills to the rescue!"
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
1,"The National Brand of the best working Lactase Tablets - they get the job done--i.e. preventing embarassing dashes for the nearest lavatory. which can be a pain if you're taking the train. particularly as it tends to be rather drafty in there and on cold mornings any trip where one has to run down a long series of connecting cars just to partially disrobe to read a newspaper and pretend that's all you went there for- which allows you to be comfortable and not have to make the weaving sway-bumping into others -as you fairly leap down the cars to the necessary--only to find it &#34;occupied&#34; - is a good thing to have on hand to use instead- make sure you take it WITH the dairy product - not after and not more than 1 minute before eating ...(heed my advice on this -or- don't say i didn't warn you)."
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
1,"I'm lucky. these are 'cheap' and work great for me; I eat a lot of dairy!I usually eat between one and three with my first bites of dairy. occasionally I've made a mistake and taken after. never have had a problem. knock on wood -funny thing. I live on a dairy farm. and I can drink our raw milk just fine. I need lactaid to eat our aged cheeses and pasteurized milk. I have not tried raw milk ice cream. and our yogurt is fine for me. all yogurt is fine for me ...I'm delighted I can buy this through Amazon. hard to get locally ..."
1,"These Lactaid tablets work well to prevent lactose intolerance induced disasters. The tablets are packaged in a way that is easy to carry around in your bag. pocket or other portable methods.I can finally enjoy foods with dairy again. I suggest taking one right before your first bite of foods with dairy and then having another in the middle of eating dairy if it is a good amount of food or you have been eating for a while. I'm very cautious so I like to be on the safe side I guess.The tablets are composed of lactase. a naturally made enzyme that people with lactose intolerance lack. so there shouldn't be any side effects to taking 'too many' tablets. I would just use common sense and experiment with how many tablets to take when eating various dairy products."
1,"I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead:[...]Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product."
1,"I suffer with very very dry eyes. They sting a lot and I frequently have to put drops in them. Recently the drops just weren't doing it for me anymore.... felt like someone glued my eyelids open and sat me in front of an industrialized heavy duty fan. I had to take frequent naps daily just to help with my stinging dry eyes. I got headaches when I read or stared at the computer too long cause of persistent stinging. For my 'Dry eye syndrome' this is the FIRST and ONLY product that has really helped. My eyes are no longer red. They do not burn. they do not dry out quickly.I still use liquid drops but maybe only once of twice daily and this is only because I am afraid my eyes dry out again.This product is worth the money and I highly recommend it."
1,"This sterile eyewash helps my dogs with his dry eye.  Once a friend was putting it in. I asked why do you do that? she said her eye itches ... so I keep a watch on my Westie. Marco Polo and wipe away his 'goop' and use the wash.  I used to use specific drops for dry eye ... but this has the same effect.It's a large bottle that you just tip. don't squeeze and the drop comes out.  Great price compared to the tiny ones."
1,"I have had problems recently with dry eyes (horribly blood shot eyes at one point). I tried a couple brands of eye drops and another recommended by my eye doctor but none provided any real relief. But. this does - yea! Also. good to have on hand for an emergency. I can't fully open my eyes working to keep the small included eye cup from leaking (which it does anyway). So. I looked into buying a larger eye cup. TheEye Wash Cup 1 Countis perfect. It is curved. slightly smaller. is easier to hold. doesn't bend. and so doesn't leak - a highly recommended addition."
1,"The single-use container version (no preservative) of Thera Tears is the only one that gives my dry eyes relief. and I've been using this product for years.  I've tried other products. which irritate my eyes rather than soothe them.  More important to me than the applicator design is the availability and pricing of the single-use container version.  Unfortunately. Walmart and Target (whose pricing was great at only $8.58 per box) recently stopped selling the boxes of single-use containers in their stores.  So. now I'm researching new sources for best pricing and availability."
1,"I've had severe dry eye for 6+years now. I've used preservative-free thera tears this whole time. They started out with a sturdy little vial that had a resealable tip. Now they've extended the tip with a long 'neck'. When I open the vial it is sometimes still sealed shut. Other times it just squirts everywhere. It's such a waste. Many people are complaining but Advance Research isn't doing a thing about it. I guess we need to log more complaints. E-mail address: info@theratears.com"
1,"I have been using another. more viscous. product for quite some time for dry eye. I tried this and liked it as something to use in between. because it is thin enough. it does not blur my vision. However. it is too thin for much protection now that the heat is on in the house. so I use both. alternating them. I have a bone to pick with the makers. though. They designed the little containers (this is preservative free single containers) with a funny grip that often blocks the liquid from coming out. which is very frustrating and not good for use while driving."
1,"I've used TheraTears for years in these handy vials but recently have not been able to find them in the stores. (The vials are far superior to the bottles that contain preservatives that irritate my eyes.) So I was delighted to find them on Amazon and ordered several boxes. They came without the box. just foil packs of vials thrown into a shipping box. Without the individual box there is no way to verify their expiration date. (I'm guessing they were expired or close to it.). I contacted the seller the same day. They sent me a return label WITHOUT the postage paid. I had to pay close to $7.00 to return them. Don't buy these from the First Aid Company."
1,"We buy these for my 89-year-old mother.  It is so much easier than having a little bottle that she cannot get the top off of.We buy them on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away (besides. the prices are up to 40% higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours. why go anywhere else?)Anyway. these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent."
1,"I bought these for my infant's first trip to Hawaii. I was freaking out about the plane and travel and yada yada... My daughter was 8 months when I used these but she's bigger than the &#34;typical&#34; 8 month old and these fit her ears fine. She was about 19# when we went to give a reference. She didn't have any trouble taking off or landing. These provide an amount of buffering to noise. similar to a regular ear plug. and this helped while we were on a prop (hopper) plane and to the regular noises of flying. I ended up buying 5 pairs to have on hand. Through the round trip of 4 legs. I used all 5 pairs since 1 fell out into the Netherlands of the airplane floor."
1,"I bought these to try out when I am in public since I suffer from near deafness in one ear and hyperacousis in the other (the body tries to compensate for a loss of one of the senses).  I cannot tolerate noisy restaurants and loud venues like Costco.  These are rubbery tubes surrounded by a spiral (screw-like) rubber.  You can place them into your ear canal and twist to seat them well.  The rubber tubes allow air to escape due to changes in air pressure so your ears do not need to pop.  I cannot use them easily since they still do not fit my abnormally narrow ear canals despite the fact that I am an adult.  Still. I can manage to make them stay for a short time by twisting and twisting and it will help if I am exposed to a loud venue and have difficulty tolerating it."
1,"The reason for this is because of the design. Instead of having a tapered curved sleeve style plug similar to the Etymotic ER20s. these have sharp ridges stab into your ear canal. They feel soft to the finger but in actuality apply more pressure on the ear canal than the standard sleeved style ear plug.  There are four ridges that taper in size and they really do push out on the ear canal as you push them into your ear.  It hurts like crazy.  Curved sleeve tapered earplugs. those ones lay against your ear canal and distribute the pressure across more ear canal surface.  With these all the pressure reside along these sharp ridges.I'm very disappointed in these. I thought they were sized for kids (which they are). they  seem to hurt more .  I know earholes differ greatly from person to person. Mine happen to be about 3/16th of an inch in diameter.  I really can't see any child wearing these comfortably. much less an adult with tiny earholes like myself."
1,"I bought FRER pregnancy tests after two years of using the cheaper Wondfu tests on amazon. I loved the wondfu tests and  left excellent feedback but my third batch I got false positives which was. obviously. heartbreaking. I decided to spend more money and buy these tests instead. Well I got my BFP today and confirmed with a digital EPT brand test as well.  I'm 13 DPO and my period was due in 1-2 days. I did test earlier with these pregnancy tests and all tests were negative until today!! I recommend these tests - accurate and quick/clear results."
1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
1,"I used these exclusively with my first two pregnancies.  Fortunately. it did not take us long to get pregnant. so I did not end up forking over more than the price of one package each time.  For my third (and current) pregnancy. in an effort to save money. I bought the Wondfo tests. and purchased the FRER to confirm the positives that I got from the Wondfo.  Wondfo detected the pregnancy at 9 DPO (6 days before my expected period). and did a good job at tracking the subsequent hormone build-up.  I can't imagine spending the money on FRER if it takes repeated attempts to get pregnant. when there are so many cheaper alternatives out there.  That said. I trust FRER's results. which is why I bought it to confirm the Wondfo results.  As I am rating the product itself (and not the price). It gets 5 stars."
1,"I used First Response for all 3 of my pregnancies. They give you accurate results and early. I just found out I am pregnant with my third and I haven't even missed my period yet. I used the First Response ovulation predictor last month and I had a feeling it was a success. I used 2 of these on Friday the 10th and Saturday the 11th. got 2 lines on both. My conception date was May 31st. Granted I know it's early and things can happen. but the point here is that this pregnancy test gave me accurate results and very early. And everyone knows. false positives are almost impossible. I highly recommend these!!"
1,"I ordered these as they are a whole lot cheaper than what they sell in the stores. 3 tests for 11 bucks?! I&#8217;ll take it. They shipped super quick to me which is another plus. The best thing though? I took this test at around 11dpo. Got a faint positive. I went to the lab the next day to get my blood drawn. Came back negative. This test was able to catch a positive before the lab&#8217;s levels could. It was only a qualitative so I don&#8217;t know what exactly my levels were. had to have been lower than 20miu(the lab&#8217;s levels). Had to go back the next week and of course. got a positive. So I&#8217;m pretty impressed with these tests."
1,"It's a shame First Response makes you think your result is accurate 4 days before your period. It is very. VERY rare to be able to get your reading that early.You simply do not have enough hgc in your blood for an at-home test to pick up.From my research. these FRER's are very accurate...but you have to wait til at LEAST 12-14DPO. And this is based on a perfect 28 day cycle with O at CD14research show s Dollar Store tests are also accurate but less sensitive. I would load up on dollar store tests then use these for final proof!Go to fertilityfriend.com and get the proof there that you will probably test negative until about a day before your period."
1,"I was Eager. so I took this test 4 days before we could start saying I'd missed or was late...The faintest of faint lines appeared... a line. is a line and it was a positive line!  My husband was skeptical... so I waited 2 days and took another one... the line was VERY CLEARLY there this time... and we were pregnant. For fun. we tried other leading brands that can detect early... and got a 'Not Pregnant' indicator... so... in my books. First response. is about as FIRST response as you  get... b/c we were infact pregnant :)Goodluck!!!"
1,"I bought this on a whim since I was one day late and my body is like clockwork. Imagine my shock when I took two test and one came out positive and the other negative. I was hyperventilating. We were safe but things happen - condoms are not 100% and I was off my pill due to how ill it made me. I made a doc's appointment for blood work and we found out I was never pregnant.... Happy ending - yes. But we are still traumatized. if this was an accurate test a lot of stress could have been avoided."
1,"First. the instructions to use your first morning urine are bad--it's best to test in the evening. If your cycles vary. there aren't enough tests to ensure you catch your surge. I never got a positive on these. and after testing with Wondfo strips (that provide more tests). I came to realize I ovulate later in my cycle. I never would have realized this on these strips. and I probably would have stuck to my initial fear (that I wasn't ovulating) if I had stayed with this brand."
1,"After using and ovulation test for 4 months as well as BBT charting. we went to the Dr. and when I explained to him that my chart &#34;looked&#34; like I had ovulated but my ovulation kit had never turned. He said it was very apparent that I was ovulating and that I needed to use a better quality ovulation kit. I bought this one over the cheaper ones I had been using and it's true. Personally. I would recommend charting first to get an idea of when to ov. test and then only test on the days that are close. These tests say start on day 10 but I don't ovulate until day 18 usually so I don't even bother now until day 14 in my cycle. If you want to save money. I would recommend using these on your &#34;most likely to Ovulate&#34; days and use the cheap ones on the other days."
1,"The first month of trying to get pregnant I used a more expensive clear blue digital test which didn't work properly as I kept getting errors of all sorts. I then got a cheap drug store brand which apparently didn't work either. I immediately ordered this for my next cycle. it was simple and easy to use. After my first try with it. I'm now 8 weeks pregnant. So what can I say. it works.Update 21/10/2013I'm sure it works!My son is now three years old so my husband and I decided we were ready to try again. So of course I turned to first response again. I bought a pack of these and used it for two cycles. They are pretty good so I was able to stretch it over two cycles. and to my surprise I'm pregnant again using these tests after two months."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
1,"Never got a positive reading with these opks. even though I did with wondfos. and I had a clear rise in BBTs for the four days following the positive reading with wondfo.  These are ridiculously priced compared to wondfos ($2.43 per test versus .40) and didn't work for me!  I would have missed my LH surge if I hadn't also tested with wondfos.  Can't recommend these based on my results.  I highly recommend wondfo opks.Update: Tried using these again this cycle. Clearblue Advanced showed a solid smiley (peak fertility) and wondfo showed a strong positive (test line was darker than the control).  FR still shows a negative. FR apparently isn't very sensitive.  While I think CBs are expensive. they do work far better than FRs for me.  I would have missed 2 LH surges if I'd solely relied on the FRs."
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
1,"I already raved somewhere about these.... they are JUST AMAZING and so far can't seem to find anything betterdon't like pills so these are very thin and compared to regular ones are night and day and they don't smell after like Trojans...you get used to how they look...but again. we disagree on the smell. I don't smell them but my other half does.these are the best we've tried so far! just amazing! ....they're hard to open but totally worth the price and the effort. He loves them. definately the best out there that we've tried. They're not slimy....will order again!"
1,"Pros: I hate condoms. and I love these. They are a little weird when you first open them up. if you don't know what to expect. Honestly. the smell is pleasant. and reminds me of kind of a leathery fruity woodsy smell. They are a little roomy when they get warmed up. which adds to the feeling of there not being anything there. For a while. I was just certain they would break at any moment because I figured an animal membrane couldn't possibly be that strong. but they are super tough. Fill one up with water and you will see what I'm talking about. I went off hormonal birth control a while ago. and have been using these instead. Again. they don't protect against STDs and should not be used by anyone but monogamous couples. Best condoms ever!Con: expensive. but I honestly would pay more for them if I had to."
1,"I cut myself rather nastily at a friend's house and he gave me one of these.  They seal tightly and absorb blood and fluids to allow natural healing.  You just put the bandage on and leave it; no changing dressings.  Although they're expensive on a per-each basis. because you don't change dressings. they may be less expensive than fabric or plastic bandages per injury.  I bought some for car. home. and suitcase. so I'll have one wherever I might need it."
1,"It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack. but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid. I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone. these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages. Flexible Fabric. 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
1,"While there is nothing wrong with the product. I am APPALLED by the magnitude of over-pricing on Band-Aid branded bandages. I am not blaming the retailers. I have also noticed that Band-Aid seems to be &#34;eliminating&#34; competing generic offerings. especially if they are in similarly sized boxes.Right after I received this I found packages of generic bandages with 100 total strips of assorted sizes at Walmart for 88 cents. That's $0.88! I checked several Walmarts BEFORE I ordered Band-Aid. but there was no better generic offerings. it was only AFTER ordering that I found them.Nonetheless. I don't have a &#34;good reason&#34; to return these (oh. I would. if I could. but it's not the seller's fault. so I don't want to make them take losses on S&H;). but I will be avoiding Band-Aid brand with even more resolve now."
1,"I have an irritated spot on my face where my CPAP mask presses too hard. and no matter how I adjust it. it still gouges that spot. Band-Aid Clear Spots help a lot. and I use a fresh one every night. The Clear Spots are also very helpful for little cuts and scrapes where a regular-sized Band-Aid would be overkill. I've been buying these in a local pharmacy. but when I saw the 3-pack (150 total) for only a couple of dollars more than I was paying for one box of 50 at the pharmacy. I was sold.The Clear Spots are a very helpful product at a very reasonable price. and I'm very pleased with the deal."
1,"First of all. let me say that whenever I tried a brand other than 'Band-aid' I was disappointed.  That said. I believe this particular style is the best I have found.  When I was having a lot of trouble with eczema on my right hand. I needed to wear band-aids on two of my fingers. to protect them so they would heal.  All the other bandaids either had fabric that began to unravel almost immediately or the cushion area was too small or the length of the bandaid was too short.  This one is just right. The whole bandaid is 2 7/8 inches long.  The cushion part is a quilted 1 inch by 1 inch square and has a nice thickness to it.  Also. the actual fabric of the bandaid is a sort of rubber-plastic. so it does not unravel and it stays on pretty well.  It is water resistant.  Buy this one for your general use.  You will probably save money in the long run."
1,"I couldn't bring myself to count all 280 bandages in each of the two packs of Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages I ordered. but I did confirm that all stated sizes were in each box in what appears to be the correct distribution. This is a heck of a lot of bandages. but I have two sons and I like to be prepared. I will re-stock our auto and personal first aid kits from these large boxes as needed. I did not carefully compare prices for these. and I suspect a local Costco or BJ's might have better per-bandage prices. but this was a painless way to stock my medicine chest."
1,"First. you don't buy specialized bandages like this very often. I think the last pack lasted well over five years.But these new ones. yikes! The adhesive - able to stick for days (thru showers). the breathe-ability of the flexible and comfortable material. the ability of this tiny bandaid to apply pressure when needed. Latex-free and hypoallergenic (I've had bad reactions to the adhesive in bandaids. not just the latex). This stuff blows away other (more recent) models of bandaids in my medicine cabinet.It reminds me more of surgical tape with a gauze pad fixed to it. Except my surgical tape isn't this quality.Where can I find this stuff in other sizes?"
1,"With our large family and all of us doing lots of sports - ok. the kids do sports and I'm just a klutz - I like to keep a large assortment of bandages in the medicine cabinet.  I like this huge 280 count box because it has some of every size in one place.  Having a separate box for each type of bandage takes a lot of space.  Most of these are the plastic kind. although it does contain some of the fabric kind. We don't use many of the little tiny square ones. but they're nice to have on hand for blisters or small cuts.  The biggest ones are perfect for knee or elbow scrapes.  The fabric ones are perfect for fingers. since the bandage is tougher.Bandaid bandages stay put on the injury. unlike some of the cheaper ones I've bought.  Every medicine cabinet should have one of these boxes. ready for any emergency."
1,"I gave this product one star because I didn't even have the chance to really test it's effectiveness because it started coming off the same day I put it on. I followed all the directions. washed and dried the affected area. etc. etc. My blister was on my hand. while most other people seem to have them on their feet from running.The directions clearly show that it can be applied to your hand (actually their illustration showed the product being applied in the exact same spot I had mine). Well it stayed on for a while until I had to wash my hands and then it just started peeling off.The product says it can get wet and is made to stay on. Don't get me started on the cost of these either. Regardless of which option you chose. your paying at least 80 cents per cushion. That's a rip off. You could purchase 40 band aids for that price. use some neosporin and replace them each day. Much cheaper.Would not recommend."
1,"We never seem to have Bandaids around when we needed them so I ordered these. They arrived quickly and contain lots and lots of Bandaids. They are of the no frills variety. meaning your traditional old-school Bandaid. No flexible fiber bands or anything. There are tons of bandaids in here. All sizes and shapes. Great if you have kids who often get hurt. or if you are accident prone. You'll always have a Bandaid in the house with this pack.Pros: Cheap.Lots and lots of Bandaids. all sizes and shapes.Cons: Very basic band-aids. not very sticky."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
1,"I bought these after having a tooth pulled that would not stop bleeding. I'm by no means an expert on gauze pads so I won't speak to quality etc. I bought the smallest size which was 2x2 inches. If you are having a tooth pulled and want to have some on hand I can recommend these. I did find I had to cut them half in order not cause my 'gag' reflex to come into play. This may have been because of all the stuff the oral surgeon had stuffed into my mouth and my brain may have had it!  Anyhow. these fit nicely into the back of your mouth when cut in half. I'm sure since I have three grandchildren under 7 that the ones I didn't use will come in handy at some point too!"
1,"With my washing machine not working. I've been doing a lot of hand laundering. as well as washing dishes. (no dish washer either) My hands with dry Winter air and harsh indoor heating have become crinkled. cracked and rough.I have a box of hand lotiona and creams and last evening applied this one just before going to bed.It helped very much.Upon awakening this morning. I nearly forgot how dry and parched they had been because they feel so nice and soft.I'll be using this every night before bed until my skin heals.Wonderful product for chapped. cracked hands."
1,"A family member had been suffering with lips so severely chapped that they would crack and bleed on a daily basis - the bottom lip looked like it was splitting in two.  This went on for several months.  After reading about this product. I purchased a tube:  within 24 hours. the pain was gone and the skin was starting to heal over.  Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed.  To say that we are shocked is an understatement. particularly when we read the ingredients. which appear to be primarily mineral oil and petroleum jelly.  This is a miracle in a tube. and we are not going to use any other chapped lip products.  Highly recommend this."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
1,"Folks. the 'active ingredient' in this crap is Petrolatum - basically. that's Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.  And this junk contains 41% of it.  Regular Vasoline Petroleum Jelly contains 100%.  At less than 1/3 the price.  So if you want to spent $6.00 on this vs. $1.50 on a Vasoline. please don't let me stop you. but I'm simply telling you basic science.  The 'inactive' ingredients include mineral oil and glycerin.This concoction is why pharmaceutical companies are despised around the world.  Take $0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly. throw in $0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin. and tout it as 'Advanced Therapy'.It's B.S. folks - pure and simple.  Junk.Save yourselves some money and do yourselves a favor - but the cheapest Petroleum Jelly you can find; Vaseline or store brand."
1,"I bought this product because I saw that there were 62 5 star reviews and almost no bad ones. A mistake. I should have read the ingredients more carefully before buying. I should have read them at all.As soon as I squeezed some out of the tube I realized it was mostly petroleum jelly. I looked at the ingredients and. sure enough. active ingredient was 41% petrolatum.THAT'S VASELINE!So. if you want greasy hands and nothing else works. maybe this is for you. But I don't. and am somewhat disappointed I didn't read the description more carefully and bought based on all the great reviews. Caveat Emptor."
1,"I discovered Aquaphor when a dear friend went on Accutane. She was in misery because her lips were so dry. Her doctor gave her some Aquaphor samples. I had thought it was only for body skin but I was very wrong. This thick. rich product soothed her lips and the dryness and cracking were gone within a day.I picked up a tube and found it has a many uses. In addition to softening lips (which I use in rotation with another favorite Carmex) Aquaphor can be used on dry knees. elbows and heels. A tiny bit works well as an eye moisturizer and it also softens cuticles.Great product for a little price!"
1,"I have dry skin and when the weather gets dry and cold. my skin keeps coming off like a snake (I think it's a common problem that many people have). Before I used Olay Moisturizer + Sun Block and it worked. However. for some reasons. it stopped working for me. My doctor recommend this to me. I tried it and it worked really well. My skin stays moisturized for the whole day. The best thing about this product is I don't have to use it everyday. I apply it on my face in the morning. wash it off by the afternoon. and my skin stays moisturize for the next 3-5 days. The only draw back is the product is waxy. When I apply it on my face. it looks like I just cover it with oil. Yes. shine. oily looking. However. if you don't care too much about your appearance. it is a perfect solution for your dry skin. Oh. did I mention that the price is very reasonable?"
1,"Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I've ever used!  I'm on Retin-A. and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I'm dealing with right now and how you're not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I've used the other $100 jars of worthlessness. and believe me. this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However. some things you do need to consider before buying:This is quite greasy. therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding's....It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I'm not complaining."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
1,"I have used this for years to combat dry skin on my face. Here is why I like it:1. It goes on clear and works very effectively to moisturize dry skin.2. It penetrates quickly. so I can wipe it off in a couple of minutes in order to avoid having a &#34;shiny&#34; looking face. but still have moisturized skin.3. It is more soothing and less greasy than vaseline.4. Unlike various facial moisturizers. it is fragrance free. so you don't have any smell after using this.5. This tube is a convenient size for travel and also to keep in the office.Bottom line: I have tried countless ointments over the years because I have always had dry skin. and this is the best one that I have found.Shop for price. I buy this for less at my local CVS than the price on Amazon."
1,"I suffer from HS and bought it for this. This is great for itches as well. It numbs the area so you can forget about it. i.e. mosquito bite. etc. I also use it for my edges. After I got my hair braided it was tight and annoying and I am using it for a few days until my hair loosens a bit. I will also use if for my eyebrows when I pluck. Apply first. leave for a few minutes. then wipe. The product should have numbed the area long enough and makes tweezing/waxing less painful. I will buy many times."
1,"After years of having toe nails that grow oddly while at the same time toe nails that would turn almost black . I started using this medication. Even after a just-a few weeks I have noticed a great change and would not be without it. My toes nails re now growing with a distinctive clear color rather than black and they are beginning to take a normal shape instead of the one-fourth inch thick toe nail I used to have. It is still too early to tell if the medication is going to completely clear up the fungi. however it appears it is working quite well."
1,"I used a different product that is Acetone based so it dried & disappeared. leaving just the medicine in place. I like it still but thought a different product might be good so the fungus doesn't get immune to it. As you might know. there is NO cure for nail fungus. not even by prescription. you can only control it.  This product here is an oil. think what it can do to your socks or if any of it gets on carpeting etc. Also my nails started getting a dark cast to the top of the nails where this was applied. This product is no good."
1,"If your going to try it and it has a applicator brush in it too . I bought the pen and it lasted about 6 weeks . Tea tree oil is really the best stuff . I am making some progress using both and planning to try kerasil or the vics vapo rub next if this doesn't clear it up after 6 months . It cleaned my little toes quick but my big toes just won't clear up . They look better but stay yellow - not gross anymore but slight greenish yellow . Getting old is no fun and either is using a dirty shower in a truck stop . Been paying for one slip in doing that for 25 years now but I treat it daily and know I won't do the same to someone else ."
1,"This is the only thing I've used that has helped the fungal infection of my big toenail (which I've had for 5 or 6 years). I use it twice a day in conjunction with Fungisoap and within a few weeks I saw improvement. My nail is no longer thick and dark. and while the infection is visibly still present. it looks much better than it did a month or two ago. I cut my nail down as far as I can and keep it filed down so I can apply this liquid under the nail as well. Right now it looks like my nail may fall off (sorry if this is TMI). but I'm hoping like others here that will mean I can continue to use this stuff on the skin under my nail. I'll update this review as time goes by."
1,"My nails and cuticles have been so dry and were looking just awful!  Some peeling of nails. but don't think it was fungus~just cold winter and using bleach to clean while at my daughter's house with no gloves.  Ran across a bottle of this stuff while looking for nail polish. remembered how it had cleared up a toe fungus years ago. and decided to try it on my nails. just to see if it would help.  WOWOWOWOWOW! You wouldn't believe the change in my cuticles and nails in the last 3 days!  Whatever is in this stuff is just really great for dry. peeling nails. with or without fungus. dry cuticles. and who knows what else! I may try it on other skin issues now.  GREAT stuff!"
1,"Bought this and Tea Tree Ultimates - Funga Soap for my wife. Both her big toes were gross and cloudy and cracking. Why it doesn't bother her more...I don't know. but I took it upon myself to buy her these two products.She started using them. and within a week or two...both nails fell out. It was super nasty...but I'm guessing both nails were so unhealthy. they probably would have come out regardless.Over the last 6 months. they've been growing back. One of them looks great. but the other is cloudy. Why? Because she doesn't use the stuff I bought her. :)I can't say what the two products do individually...because she only used them together. For the price though. it's worth some of the more expensive options at the doctors office. But you have to be disciplined and actually put the stuff on!"
1,"Probably one of the world's best inventions. Vaseline.  But. this tube is just fantastic for babies.  We bought these for our newborn and it's just so much easier to use when you're putting it on the baby's belly button.  Plus. it's best for preventing diaper rash than anything else out there on the market.  When your hands are dry from washing them after EVERYTHING you do with the baby. the Vaseline comes to the rescue. This tube is a marvelous invention and the best sanitary-wise to use for a baby.  I keep one in my purse for my dry hands too.  Love this invention!"
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
1,"Every year my Lab (Maggie) gets some kind of contact dermatitis or allergy on her Neck. Not sure from what. This year I purchased the BFI and the Columbia Powder. I do remember as a kid I think my parents used the BFI. At that time it was in a little metal can. Anyway  I use them both and they worked great. Just can't say which one works best. They probably both work the same but I would lean towards the BFI because I remember it as a kid."
1,"This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy.  Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day.  I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I don't add more than the water required in the directions; a watery orange taste can be terrible so don't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I don't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me.  This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis."
1,"What can I say? Metemucil works. not only to prevent constipation but also to prevent the runs. Our GI doc actually prescribed it years ago to slow down the works.If you check the labels. Metamucil has more soluble fiber that any other supplement I could find. Cheaper too.Since we use one cannister almost monthly the subscribe & save is great. If you drink it in about 10 oz. water quickly. it does not get mushy. Just don't let it sit for any length of time.It is GF. has no MSG or related products or aspartates."
1,"This product contains way too much sugar for me. I just compared Metamucil (48.2 Oz Container) to Benefiber (18.7 Oz Container). and found the following:With Metamucil you get 114 servings per container.Serving Size: 12g (One rounded Tbsp)Calories Per Serving: 45Total Carb: 12gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 2gSugars: 9gIron: 0.8mgSodium: 5mgPotassium: 30With Benefiber you get 115 servings per container.Serving Size: 4.6g (Two Tsp)Calories Per Serving: 15Sodium: 0gTotal Carb: 4gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 3gSugar: 0gMetamucil is tasty but it gets too thick to drink if not consumed immediately. Benefiber is a little more expensive. but at least I'm not paying for sugar and putting on weight from the empty calories.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
1,"I'm glad that amazon carries this product because I can't find it in my area anymore. I've tried many pre-shave conditioners thru the years but this works best for me. I don't really like buying 12 of these at a time but the price is right and even buying 12 is still cheaper than buying just one of some of the other products I have tried. I will share this with my son and son-in-law who both use this product too. Thanks Amazon for keeping this available to us!"
1,"I have been buying this lotion for 6 years from my grocery store. Usually they cost $3-$4 each but now none of my grocery stores carry this anymore. I got this 12 pack for $26 and free shipping and you can't beat that anywhere. This lotion makes it so easy to use my electric shaver without any irritation and it glides with a close shave. Also you need next to very little after shave after using this because it has lotion built in and has a very subtle scent you can use a different after shave lotion or cologne without the 2 scents clashing."
1,"After using all types of eyebrow grooming wax to hold down my unruly brows. I had almost given up until I found this gem of a product.  My current eyebrow wax was a little too hard and unfortunately would yank out a few hairs with it.  In a last ditch attempt. I tried the clubman moustache wax in neutral.  Keep in mind that my eyebrow hairs are VERY unruly (and yes. I am a lady)and finding something that really works and has staying power had been difficult until now.  You only need the smallest amount on each brow because the product is very concentrated.  My eyebrow hairs stay in place all day and look better than they ever have.  I also like the fact that it dries clear and that there is no build up.  It also doesn't dry out my skin like other products.  Definitely a keeper!"
1,"I got this a few days ago and each day my handlebar looks better. It's like my mustache is learning to form a curl on both sides. This goes on soft and easy with very little work and then after about 15 to 30 seconds it sets and you have a very firm but still pliable hold. It has a very pleasant fresh scent that reminds me of grapefruit. It washes out very easily my one complaint is that the neutral shows up as white on my red stache and makes me look like i'm greying or have dried boogers unless I am very judicious in my use of the product. So until I find something else this is my go to with a light touch."
1,"This was actually the boyfriend's purchase since he wanted to try black (his hair is naturally black) instead of the clear which is all he can find in stores around here.His opinion was that clear is a lot better even though you have to work it in to make sure it doesn't show up because the black is too messy (i.e. it's black and tends to get on everything.)It'd probably be good if you wanted to darken your moustache/beard though.Aside from that he likes Clubman's and I have to say it makes his beard look much nicer...keeps his beard in control."
1,"The odor was too strong for me. It was a fruity sweet smell but it wasn't working for me.  I had to wash my moustache within five minutes because I couldn't stand it.Also the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it.  It was looking bad to me visually.It did hold the hairs into place for the brief time I used it.The only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush. Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection."
1,"My beard always grew in patchy and I tried a ton of things to fill it out. This wax is the best by far.It's good and thick. but you can add water if you'd like to thin it out. It has a tiny brush for pinpoint accuracy. It tends to get on your fingers. then anything you touch. but you can't blame black wax for that. You can only blame mother nature. And if you got a problem with mother nature. you got a problem with me.It can rub off. but a holding spray or spritzer can help it hold. My beard looks naturally fuller and i've gotten a ton of compliments from other beard enthusiasts."
1,"this wax is awesome. its soft and easy to apply it drys on clear and will hold my mustache for a good 10-15 hours without me having the fix it.only complaints are that sometimes it irritates my skin or drys it out. and the container it is in normally ends up getting damaged or a hole in it since its metal and will eventually just get a hole in it from squeezing or folding the tube. ussually happens to me when the tube is 50-75% gone but it will dry out inside the tube fast when it happens. Ive been through about 4 of these in a year and it happened to all of them."
1,"I've been alarmed by the reviews on various sellers' sites saying they had ordered cylindrical and received tapered. I ordered these in August and did receive cylindrical brush tips. as pictured. The wires are pretty weak. and easily bent. but that's unavoidable if it's going to fit into tight spaces. They're supposed to be changed weekly. and I can generally get a week's worth of use out of one. despite having some teeth that are both very close. and slightly crooked. so it's a guessing game inserting the wire at just the correct angle to slide right in.I use a Proxabrush with the conical tip at one end for wide spaces. and the cylindrical one at the other end."
1,"I use these with the Oral B interdental holder that my hygienist gave me. She originally gave me some of the WIDE interdental brushes which worked fine for larger gaps. but the #414 'Tight' works for more of my gaps. There are still a lot of spaces that these will not fit. so I recommend using regular floss as well as a Waterpik in conjunction with these interdental brushes. My normal routine is to floss. use the interdental in most spaces. then use a Waterpik. followed by an Oral B powered brush.Overall: 5/5 stars. as advertised - may not fit in the tightest gaps. but works for 90% of my teeth. I'd probably go with Moderate for a better fit in the larger gaps."
1,"I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal. and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums. and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit. it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea. but the others worked much. much better for me.  I would not recommend these."
1,"The 'tight' proxabrush refills are just what I wanted and ordered. They get into most of the small between teeth gaps that the larger brushes do not.My only problems with the tight ones is that the wire is so fine they don't last very long (and bend too easily) and there are still some teeth that tight are still too big to get between.I also ordered 'wide' only because I couldn't find 'extra-wide' on Amazon.For both sizes. the brushes eventually wear out - getting either shorter or come off the wire. but each one lasts at least a week for my use (daily)."
1,"I hate flossing but I do it anyway.  I actually should say. I &#34;hated&#34; flossing.  The time it takes annoys me and it seems like my gums still bled everytime anyway.  Now I floss. use this to stimulate my gums and then brush.  This tool is awesome.  My gums like it.  They aren't bleeding now and I get more out with this thing because it goes around the whole tooth not just in between.  I really like it a lot enough to use it every day. I actually look forward to using it.  My teeth feel really clean now."
1,"I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it's ease in purchasing. I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis. You run the rubber tip (point) between your teeth and gum line. The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove. The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth. Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results. When the rubber tip starts to curl. then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago. I also use daily a water pick as well. as prescribed also."
1,"We've used these for years but most recently. they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist. he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well."
1,"This is VERY durable; it hasn't broken in the months I've had it. (I forgot to write a review until now...).I had wanted a gum stimulator for quite some time. and I decided to buy this one. it was inexpensive. and it looked legit. Great product for a great price. I am a 100% pleased customer. When this one gets old or worn out (it still hasn't at all though!). I will definitely be purchasing this exact one again. (maybe from a drugstore. to avoid shipping costs. But still this product!)I also bought refills (replacement rubber tips) for when the tip gets worn.Note: For a while I was wondering why the rubber tip felt so hard and stiff... and nothing on the package said that you have to run it under hot water to soften it up before uses.. that. or I just didn't see it. Then again. it is sorta logical... but yeah. Run it under hot water to soften it. :D"
1,"With an angled head like a dental probe. the rubber tipped GUM Stimulator is a handy tool for stimulating the gums. and removing plaque from hard to get to areas. like behind the back teeth.  The sharp rubber tip works well in between teeth. and also along the gumline.  While it is recommended that the tip be heated before use to soften the rubber. it probably isn't necessary.  If the tip wears out or breaks. replacement tips are available.Controlling plaque is a lifelong challenge for most of us. and this is a very helpful tool in the battle.  Check your local drugstore for a better deal."
1,"The G-U-M stimulators do exactly what they should do - get the bad stuff out and away from around your teeth.  Even after brushing long and thoroughly. there is still stuff left under the gum rims. The G-U-M Stimulator tip removes the bad stuff without hurting your gums.The difficult part about the G-U-M stimlators is getting the rubber tips onto the metal handle.  It takes a lot of hand strength.  Moistening the tip with hot water helps. but it still takes a lot of hand strength.  The other downside is that a single stimulator is good for only about 3 or 4 uses - then the tip begins to break.  Time to wrestle a new tip onto the handle."
1,"Not much to say here. but I like when products I'm looking at have reviews.These are durable. good. effective... Basically. they are exactly what you want when you are looking for replacement tips for your gum stimulator. Also. they are inexpensive. I will definitely buy these again when I need more!Note: They may seem stiff at first. but you are supposed to run them under hot water to soften them before use. It took me a while to figure that out. I think it's on the package. but I don't remember.Anyways. good product. 5 stars!"
1,"These are great travel toothbrushes and I recommend them.  However; at the time I was updating my emergency kit and wanted to add a new compact toothbrush.  Not to take away from this great product - I found a better one right here on Amazon called the Wisp tooth brush.  They are one time use toothbrushes that come with toothpaste attached and weigh nothing.  So. if your traveling overseas or somewhere where ounces don't count these are great and compact enough.If ounces count check out the Wisp toothbrushes you'll be glad you did.  I am now happy I have both and I recommend both for different uses."
1,"I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.What's wrong with it?1- the threader part used to be longer & stiffer. thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework. especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth. Now it's short. flimsy. & bends so easily. it doesn't do the job it was designed to accomplish2- the floss portion used to be much thicker. fluffier & stronger. Now it is a mere shadow of itself. and as such is totally useless. And. it shreds!I had read the poor reviews. and always try to keep an open mind. Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on.  This stuff is worthless. Do not waste your money. Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution."
1,"This is IMHO the best floss you can get with or without braces. It takes some practice. and when you get it. you will see how effective this floss is. The fabric works very well at removing an incredible amount of gunk b/w your teeth. It will shred if you get it caught on your braces or if you snag it on something but again it takes practice to avoid doing that. I havent been able to find this stuff in stores around my home. usually. its the only hanger thats empty. Annoying so I have had to buy online."
1,"I had to try this after reading its description.  My denture comfort liner had come off (as my orthodontist said it would) and I couldn't afford an airline trip to have him reline my upper denture.  I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me. and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable.  Even after I faithfully followed the instructions. I got poor results.  It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours...and. much to my surprise. the stuff came off in a gooey mass.  I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures--it's an effort. just getting the cream out of the tube--hoping that exposure to air might mean better results. but that didn't work either."
1,"This may be the world's worst product. It is hard to work with. even when following the directions carefully. Once in place. it squishes out of your dentures all over the outside. No matter how much you clean it off. moer of it squishes right back out again. In addition. even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more. when the denture is removed. the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth; not in the denture. No doubt. this manufacture was trying to make a product to help people but it does not work."
1,"This is a weird sort of &#34;goo&#34; that comes out malleable like fairly hard putty. It can be molded. but it's a little too hard to mold to the gums well enough. I left it in for a few days and it was VERY hard to remove! It seems to have a slightly glue-like consistency. I can see it being perhaps useful in &#34;fine-tuning&#34; a temporary reline kit. but DON'T confuse it with actual denture adhesive. It doesn't stick to the gums AT ALL."
1,"'Cushion Grip' is a paste that is formulated to hold loose dentures in place for a long time - several days in fact (not that it is recommended to keep a denture in for days on end!).  Said another way. the paste has properties that allow it to remain retentive for several days.  I have recommended it to some of my denture patients (if they have a properly made denture. yet still need added retention).If you have to use excessive amounts of paste to keep a denture in. then the denture probably needs to be remade or relined (or perhaps an implant supported denture should be considered in cases of severe bone loss).konedog"
1,"First off I would not call this adhesive. It works good to use it at night before bed. I put in warm water till soft. roll it like a worm and sit it in the denture. Close my mouth till comfortable not tight.  It feels warm at first  and I try not to clamp my teeth or move my mouth much. In the morning dentures come right out not stuck at all. If product overflowed above denture I gently trim it. After that I use my regular adhesive and dentures fit great. You take them out wash and put back in with your reg adhesive for four or five days till the Cushion Grip starts coming loose.  Soak dentures in warm water and you can work the old Cushion Grip loose in one piece. I would only recommend for people that have really loose dentures as a temp fix.  It does need to be used with reg adhesive because Cushion Grip is not an true adhesive. just builds up and fills in dentures."
1,"Nice product but after many trials. opted for another adhesive product.  Although CUSHION GRIP is  a good product. it takes second place. in my opinion. to EFFERGRIP.  Why?  Well. CUSHION grip requires placing tube in hot water for about 5 or so minutes and then applying to dentures.  Besides. it costs a lot more than the EFFERGRIP.  For some folks. this could be seen as okay because CUSHION GRIP doesn't need to be applied every day but maybe every 3-5 days while EFFERGRIP requires daily application.All in all. the ease of use of EFFERGRIP makes it the top choice. in my humble opinion."
1,"'Sea Bond' denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste. gel. or powder. the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist. I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue. In this case. the Sea Bond pad fills in in the gap and helps seal the denture. I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this. However. dentures are not cheap and this product serves as a stop-gap measure until a new denture or reline can be done.Jim 'Konedog' Koenig. DDS"
1,"After a friend burned some gum tissue on some overheated coffee. a dentist recommended this product. both for its healing properties and overall cleansing ability.  As listed above. this product is recommended (by 'dental professionals!')for canker sores. gum irritations. denture & mouth sores. orthodontic irritations. mouth burns. and cheek bites (I'm not sure what the latter is).  I tried a little. and the taste was pleasant and the liquid nonirritating.  There is a mild foaming action as well.  Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional."
1,"This is the regular Plax (not a knock off product). With the free shipping and no tax. it beat the prices I can get at the local stores even on sales. However. it still isn't very cheap. Maybe if you get lucky with a sale you can beat the price at retail.I use a little measure graduated cylinder (rectangle actually) from a water test kit to measure out about 7ml when I use this stuff. If you swig it out of the bottle you'll find you probably use 10-20 ml per rinse. All you really need is 6 to 7 ml. and at the prices for this. you are wise to make yourself measure it out. You might as well anyway to not waste..."
1,"I like always have to take good care of my own teeth.I did a little research like I always do.and found I wanted to try this mouthwash. however it is hard to find this available at any store :(But after searching and doing my homework I found it at: www.drugstore.com/A store I highly recommend.I do all my shopping for items that you would so at that store online.Getting back to the mouthwash. I ordered it because I had heard so many good things about it. things not all mouthwashes do. you see therefore not all are equal.It has a nice taste. I hate the other ones that make you feel like a rocket went off in your mouth and is so strong and zesty!This one is pleasant. and nice.I suggest you try this. I just wish it was more available. I worry they will discontinue it. So you might want stock up on this if you like it. Yes &#34;note to self&#34;"
1,"okay i was very skeptical about this at first. but after i tried it. it seemed to help me cure gingivitis! and plus it softens up tartar buildup so you are actually brushing away hard tartar without the dentists need!Amazing ive been using this for about a week now and 1 week ago i had a small tartar formation and today its reduced by a large percentage!i freaking love Plax this will put those cheapskate dentists out of business!Listerine and Crest despise products that actually help the teeth get rid of plaque and tartarall Crest and Listerine can do is just give you a 'tartar and plaque fighting solution' but Plax actually removes alot of plaque buildup and dissolves tartarof course it doesnt say it dissolves tartar on the product but you have to use logic. tartar comes from fossilized plaque or plaque builduponce you get rid of plaque you have raw access to tartar if you have raw access to tartar its only a matter of time until its all gone5 stars.oh its a prebrush rinse use it before you brush"
1,"I've tried them all.  Natural Ice is one of the best. and MUCH cheaper than many others.  The cherry flavor fades quickly so you're NOT tempted to bite or lick at your lips.  It goes on smoothly which is important when your lips are chapped and dry.  Your lips respond almost immediately.  There is a slight tingling when you put it on. which is the medication going to work.  I bought one dozen in January. and I bought 2 more today. That fact alone says a lot.Caution: Be careful if you get it on your fingers not to rub at your eyes.  It will sting."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
1,"I have used this product (lip balm)for a long time. and I am extremely satisfied with it. because it has SPF15 and menthol. That is why I ordered this product again.The shipment arrived sooner than expected and the product is undamaged. I was keeping my fingers crossed because the climatic condition for the past few days has been extremely hot. Said and done. the lip balm did not melt.I. highly recommend. NATURAL ICE MENTHOLATED SPF15 Lip Balm for every one for daily use.Thank you. people at NATURAL ICE and thank you. AMAZON.SincerelyKJ Kumar"
1,"Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips. that peel and bleed.  Chapstick. Carmex. etc...  work for me. but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So. I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST. and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product. I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands. not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful."
1,"In an urgent need to fix badly cracked/chapped lips I turned to Amazon to find a lip balm.I first tried outBurt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube. .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)only to end up with no improvement after 3 or so days. Although this might not be a fair amount of time I was in agony over my lips and needed a quick fix. I was in need of moisturizing my lips and repairing them. not just protecting them from further damage.I turned to Mentholatum Natural Ice hoping this would be an improvement over Burt's (for me. not that either product is bad) only to find out they were pretty much the same. There was no noticeable difference and my lips weren't improving after another 3 days.I would recommend this product for proactive lip protection. but I would look elsewhere for a moisturizing lip balm when being reactive to cracked/chapped lips."
1,"This is by far the best product...ever...for Urinary Infections.  Better than anything you can have prescribed by a Doctor.  I did a lot of research about Cystex before I even ordered it.This is a very cleaver product...each tablet contains 1/2 of a normal aspirin. which acts against the immediate pain. and another ingredient that creates a chemical reaction in the kidneys and bladder and kills the bacteria and cures the problem.  I am a very allergic person and afraid to take any medication. but this is a dream come true for me.  Don't expect it to work in minutes. but all of a sudden...in a few hours...you will feel pain free.  The bottle says dose is 2 Tablets every eight hours. but I only take one every eight hours for two days and it's just great.  This is a staple for every medicine cabinet."
1,"This product is good and I like it. however the price keeps going up just like many other things once they notice it is selling and get greedy. I am seeking a generic brand of this product so that I can lower my out of pocket expenses. I am a man and do use this product. it really does help when you are exposed to bacteria in your system. I will seek an alternative if price does not lower back to the acceptable range it was at previously or seek another store that sells at the lower price."
1,"I keep these around for emergencies. Recently. I was waiting on the doctor to phone in a prescription for me because it was the second bladder infection in less than a month and I didn't have time for an office visit. Well. she took her sweet time about it. Without these. I probably would have ended up in urgent care over the weekend. With Cystex I almost forgot I had a bladder infection until I forgot to take them one day and I was quickly reminded. I highly recommend keeping a bottle of this in your medicine cabinet. especially if your prone to frequent bladder infections."
1,"I get UTIs when I get overtired/overtextended. around twice a year.  I had been taking AZO but it did not control the pain from the most severe infections (which always happen Saturday at 4 pm when the Doctor is not available until Monday!).  AZO was OK for mild infections.So this time I did some research and people spoke highly of Cystex. Since I didn't have enough time to order it from Amazon I bought it at CVS.  It is significantly (25-30%) cheaper than AZO and works better (at least for me). For the most severe UTIs I would still go to the Doctor and get antibiotics but for moderate and inconveniently timed UTIs. Cystex works beautifully and is a real savior. The pain went away in about 20 minutes and after 2 days of suffering. it was wonderful."
1,"Wish I'd known about this product in my 20s. Now that I'm in my 40s. I find that the hormonal changes are making UTIs something I need to be vigilant about again. after many years without them. I alternate between taking one of these at bedtime. & a daily tsp of D-mannose as a preventive measure. The mannose absorbs & carries away bacteria & the Cystex has a disinfecting action. so a multi-pronged approach. However. for travel these are a good deal less trouble than mannose which is a white powder. I have not had a single UTI in the 6 months I have been using this. I also give one to my elderly collie twice a week as she has developed the same issue. =o)  At least we're in this menopausal adventure together."
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
1,"This product changed my bladder problems from bad to better. but I still have flow problems.The main thing is that a full 6 tablets caused me to have spells of disorientation. I take no drugs. so it wasn't a compatibility issue. I now take 1 in the morning and two at bedtime with no ill effects. The full dose of 2 three times daily caused me problems.I am 68 and a major cancer survivor. but I don't think that affected it.UPDATE: 3/26/2013Working well now. I have chronic bladder problems. but I take 2 tablets in the morning. 1 in the afternoon. and 2 at night. I think I've adjusted to it now. Still have some flow issues. but the bladder discomfort is long gone. I recommend it! Better than Rx drugs.TaosGuy"
1,"When your kids go to school they get exposed to just about everything. About once a year our grandson gets the flu and sick to his stomach. He also has allergies that can make him sick to his stomach when he eats certain foods. Emetrol seems to settle down his nausea and help him not feel so ill.It contains no products that a child should be normally afraid of taking and it is doctor recommended. It does seem to help him a lot. It does recommend that you should not drink any fluids immediately before or after taking the product.We have had good success with it and we keep it on hand for those emergencies!"
1,"I've been a pack a day smoker for 40 years now and I just gotta kick this stupid habit. Been using these every day for the past six weeks now and have not yet smoked a cigarette in that time. I think that at this point it might just be psychological. but I'm still tempted to head over to 7-11 and buy a pack. so I keep putting on a 21 mg patch every morning and continue to tell myself how disgusting it would be if I start smoking again. Still taking it minute by minute and day by day. but I never could be doing this without the aid of the NicoDerm patches."
1,"Bought cheap CVS brand patches and they never stuck to my skin.  These stayed on the whole day through.It itched a little bit but nothing I coulnt eventually ignore (itching subsided as day wore on).When I removed the patch there was a red blotch there. but other than seeing it was red it didnt hurt nor itch nor have any other symptoms.  Redness went away by the end of the next day (you use a different area of skin for each new patch each day).Dreams were vivid when I left patch on overnight.  Vivid. but not nightmarish in any sense.  I actually enjoyed it.The nicotine was very effective in quelling my urge to smoke. though I didnt quit smoking.  At the peak of my efforts I was down to 6-7 cigarettes per day when I had been smoking close to 40.As a nicotine substitute. it delivers!"
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
1,"I quit smoking twice. so far (hope I won't have to quit a third time but that remains to be seen...).The first time I used NRT. specifically NicoDerm. I followed all the three steps. for as long as it was recommended. It worked. I was able to quit smoking. Staying quit though. that was a whole different matter. I took smoking again after about 3 months. and kept smoking for 6 months when I quit again. This time around I used Allen Carr's method. and it was by far a more efficient method. It's all about mentality and unfortunately. NRT reinforces the wrong kind of mentality."
1,"This is a stable and excellent product. The quality of the blades are very good. subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had. There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation. A very good product to buy. those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades. At Amazon - the price is excellent for this product. Just update - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back. NO RUSTS."
1,"I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far. I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip. I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham"
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
1,"This is the ONLY razor I've ever found that can cut through my husband's beard.  No. I don't live with Grizzy Adams. but he's close! :)  Life without these is just ridiculous - he has to shave 3 times a day with any other razor.  Really. no kidding.  This razor not only does an outstanding job. but it doesn't cut up his face in the process. I cannot say enough good about this razor.  He's been using them for 12 years and won't be without them.  Highly. highly recommend!"
1,"This product is an excellent buy and at 1/4th the cost at any store or online sites.  My family loves the product and recommend this product as a great buy.  I even subscribed so the product  is delivered without having to go and order it.  The product just comes when I decide how often.  This is a wonderful program which recommend to all who use products and not have to go and order it over and over!!  A must buy with an awesome program to make it easier to get the best at a good cost :)"
1,"I tried the Fusion product and have now gone back to Mach3.  I contacted P&G; over my concerns and must say that you are totally on your own if you have a problem.  P&G; won't even take the time to respond to a person letter or issues related to their products.The Mach3 is a good. simple and straight-forward product that works well.  The price on all blades is so very. very high when you think about the basic components. but one needs them.  So. this is my preference."
1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
1,"shaving almost daily for 30+ years now and tried most brands cartridge or disposable.atra was a great blade my worst experience the schick intuition plus.any of the mens mach3 blades a mug. brush and shaving soap is all you will needfor what may be one of life's finest pleasures...Closest shave on this planet. like silk baby!excellent blades. cost and experience for precision quick shavers..no man could ever beat our timing and terrain girlsmake sure you only buy your blades from amazon. don't get ripped upwith bootleg blades around here.blow dry them or place razor in a cup or stand at least(keep them clean/dry)for blade life.no goosebumps or forget about it. turn up the heat please.as for fusion and proglide i love them/but they are costly and mach3 willgive you the fine bare shave you desire for less."
1,"We've been using Mach 3 razors since the 1990s. and I buy this 15-pack here on Amazon because they're cheaper at $1.84/each than buying them at Costco.  Add in free SuperSaver or Prime shipping and they're a great deal!We like that the Mach 3 razor cartridges last for several weeks. even with daily shaving.  They give a smooth. close. nick-free shave without any irritation. and the blades don't rust when left in the shower.We've tried all kinds of blades through the years. and always come back to Mach 3."
1,"This is a decent blade that will give a nice shave for a few days. maybe weeks. with the added advantage of being able to get in tight spots better than later bigger head models of Gillette razors.  The biggest drawback is the price.  Gillette sucks you in with a low cost razor that uses high cost blades.  It's like some printers that are sold at cost or below just to get you into the market for expensive cartridges.  It's gotten so bad that many retailers keep Mach3 and Fusion blades under lock and key to prevent theft.  I've switched back to a double edged razor where you might expect an initial one-time cost of the razor but with very low cost replacement blades. not to mention double edged razors give closer shaves than the Mach3 or Fusion.  And they'll never go out of date.  So these blades get 3 stars for a combination of a decent shave combined with an exorbitant price."
1,"been using mach 3 blades for years. and they work great. I've (unknowingly) bought knockoffs on ebay before. and was able to tell the difference immediately and got a refund. Since then I've been buying them on amazon. because they're cheapest here as long as you buy a decent quantity.I've tried 4-blade and 5-blade razors. and none are any better. so I haven't bothered to permanently switch.also. you can make your blades last longer by storing the blades in mineral/baby oil when not in use. It prevents the oxidation and dulling of the blades"
1,"I have owned Mach3 razor for over 3 years now. The razor is good. but hard to differentiate its performance from Sense Excel ( I have owned that one before). Only reason I switched to Mach3 was honestly. I got bored using the same razor. The blades give normal performance. nothing out of the blue like they show on tv. It doesn't causes itching. so that the good part about the blades. However. after a month of use. for a good shave you will need multiple strokes on the same spot. Overall. decent purchase. nothing extraordinary."
1,"I'm an older guy with a very tough beard. When I was just beginning to shave (about 48 years ago) my father proudly gave me a Remington electric razor.  It never did a good enough job and I found myself going for a Gillette blade system.I have used these Gillette Mach 3's ever since they came out. They do the job for me better than anything else I've tried. so I've stuck with them. I buy them on Amazon when the price is right.For those reviewers claiming that they received fake blades. send them back for a refund. Or better yet. contact Gillette and let them know what you received.  Gillette wants to stop the trade in counterfeit blades and will be happy to work with you."
1,"I've used the Mach 3. in its different incarnations. for the past 10 years or so.  But I've always hated buying refill cartridges because of the price.  I even resorted to using disposable Mach 3s for the past few months. but I really hated them.  I was very happy to find these refill cartridges available on Amazon for such a good price. especially with Subscribe and Save.  Now I get them delivered to me at a great price.  Now if I could only find the Mach 3 Turbo or M3Power refill cartridges for the same price..."
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
1,"These razors are definitely solid. I've been using Mach 3 razors for a long time and always get a close shave. quickly and with cuts being very rare and usually the result of my own negligence. That being said these razors are just too expensive! They are even more in the grocery store. but even online they are more than 2 dollars when you buy a dozen! Shortly after I bought this box of razors I discovered Dorco which has a mach 3 like system with razors that costs less than a dollar each and are very sharp. I switched to Dorco after I finished out this box of razors."
1,"IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONI fell in love with Mach3 razors years and switched over from a single-blade (not straight-edge) razor.  I just wish the price was cheaper!  I saved a few bucks and time by ordering these Mach3 razors directly through Amazon.  Everything went fine with the order.  The package arrived quickly and the product was not opened.  The razors appear to be in their original packaging (plastic is not cut and it is the Gillete stuff).THE CATCHI thought I had gotten past all the online negative reviews of counterfeits.  Nonetheless. I found it quite odd that the plastic cases (holding 4 razors each) were scrapped and had smudges on them once I cut open the plastic packaging.  Those oddities seem to suggest the product is not brand new.CONCLUSIONAll seems fine so far.  We'll see..."
1,"Shaving is about as personal thing you can do. It's not an experience you can share. It doesn't make for scintillating conversation. So. PERSONALLY. the Gillette Mach 3 is the best razor for my beard. My beard is pretty tough: to use the belabored joke. my five o'clock shadow makes its appearance around noon. And it's thick. However. the skin underneath is very sensitive. This razor gives me that 'close shave' without irritating my face. The price for the cartidges are. yes. a little high. But it's a small price to pay for a product that works. It's sort of like paying a little extra for 'bathroom tissues'. (But that's another personal thing we do alone that rarely makes for scintillating conversation.)"
1,"Sometimes it just makes sense to shell out the additional funds for a superior product. I have a very tough and fast-growing beard that is a challenge to all the different razors (manual and electric) I've tried over the past 45 years.  I have stayed with the Mach 3 ever since it first came out and even convinced my wife that it would be good for shaving her legs. Actually she picked it up once instead of using her usual disposable and from then on I kept finding my razor in the shower.I learned a long time ago when using knives and axes that a good cutting edge needs to be complimented by a proper handle.  Normally the heavier and more durable the handle. the better the cut.  The Mach 3 handle is slightly beefier than most and it makes a difference. resulting in a good angle during application and a smoother shave with no irritation.  Until someone can prove to me that there is a better razor out there. we're sticking with the Mach 3."
1,"I'm buying this set of 6 shaving creams for my husband for the 2nd time....if he didn't like the cream he would have said not to purchase again. At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me. I think it smells good and my husband is happy with how it shaves....so there you have it. not exactly a rave review but definitely a 'thumbs up'.Cheers"
1,"$13 might seem like a lot of money for a bottle of cold medication but it's really difficult to put a price on good nights sleep!I was a little put off by the price of Vicks VapoSteam but I didn't realize how long this stuff will last. This bottle. for my Vicks humidifier. will definitely last the entire winter season. so the price isn't so much when you think about it that way.I worried that the smell might be too strong or even irritating but it doesn't overwhelm at all. it's actually quite comforting as it just sort of lofts around my bedroom.I don't use it only when I have a cold but when my head or nasal passages are just stuffed up from daily allergies (my cats!:) or the dry. discomforting winter air that's so irritating to my nose.  About 10 minutes after the humidifier is turned on. my breathing is so much easier and pleasant. I really appreciate this stuff."
1,"I've never understood why Amlactin (and same-formula creams/lotions) have never been very popular for dry skin. People always go for the cosmetic brand lotions. but Amlactin works differently and MUCH better.  The active ingredient in Amlactin is lactic acid. which exfoliates dry. itchy or bumpy skin. and is great for those with keratosis pilaris. After just a few applications. you'll notice soft. supple. silky smooth skin.It smells a touch &#34;chemical-ish&#34; but it's not strong and the scent doesn't last. like some scented lotions. Also. since it's not fragranced. guys can use it too (actually my dad does).It tends to run a bit on the pricy side for lotions. but it's definitely worth it. especially if you have rough. dry. bumpy skin."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
1,"I have used this product for Keratosis Pilaris Rubra (KPR - the type of KP that involves reddish bumps) all over my arms. Unfortunately. it makes the inflammation worse. While it (perhaps) may be good for Keratosis Pilaris Alba (the type of KP that doesn't have redness on/around the bumps). it worsens my type of KP since it inflames the skin. Produced a rash on my arms that put me through itchy. painful. burning hell for a week. It hurt my skin so bad.On a positive note: Good moisturizer though. Just worthless treatment for KP.What a waste of much needed money and hope for a cure for this darned skin ailment! :o("
1,"My dermatologist recommended AmLactin and Carmol 20 Cream to help with severe dry cracked heels. I used both products for several weeks into a couple of months and had *some* improvement but there was still a ways to go before I'd say my feet were going to be 'baby soft'. I wasn't really pleased with the expense. odor. and clammy feel that I'd experience with this combination and still getting lackluster results. so I did some more searching.I found a really good electric callous remover; it is made by Bario and hopefully you can find one with a google search. I continued to try different creams and lotions and have settled on one that really works and works fast - O'Keefes Creme. This creme is inexpensive. non-greasy. and unscented. I saw excellent results within a week - the elusive 'baby soft' feet everyone has been talking about. Finally!Hope everyone finds *something* that works for them."
1,"I've got keratosis pilaris. aka chicken skin. This does a great job of smoothening out the skin on my arms. It takes awhile to start working. as in weeks to months. but you'll definitely feel a difference. I feel less self conscious about my arms when in public wearing a short sleeved shirt.The only thing i didn't like about it was how runny it is. It's very watery. so you should rub it between your hands then distribute it to the body part otherwise it'll just drip everywhere. Also once it's on your skin it feels kind of sticky for awhile. till it absorbs more.Overall i'd recommends this product because it does it's job pretty well. Price is a little higher than i'd like but my arms are smoother so i'm happy to pay that price."
1,"I put this lotion on everything. It is hands down one of the most important beauty products that I couldnt live without. I use this all over and it is the ONLY lotion I have found which 1. doest break me out. 2. actually moisturizes my skin. 3. I can use on my body and my face. I blend drops of hyaluronic acid which I buy from Amazon in with the moisturizer for an added boost. It keeps my skin glowing. smooth and beautiful.I also use this on my boyfriends KP and it is the first time he said he has had any success in getting it to go away.I am impressed with this product more than any other beauty product."
1,"AmLactin moisturizing products come in different strengths to help alleviate rough. dry skin. This 'Moisturizing Body Lotion' is for everyday use (recommended use is 2X daily) and works well to keep skin hydrated.For a dry skin cure. begin with AmLactin's 'XL Lotion' for feet and hands or 'Ultra Hydrating Body Cream' for all over smoothing. Once your desired results are achieved. switch to this one for maintenance.Currently Amazon directly sells only the Moisturizing Body Lotion. It is also the only Amlactin product available through Subscribe and Save. Other AmLactin products are available from third parties. some of whom are Prime eligible.You'll be hard pressed to find the Moisturizing Lotion anywhere for less than Amazon and I cross my fingers that Amazon will again directly sell the other AmLactin products."
1,"My husband brought this home to me and I was excited to use it. I have very dry skin and I am always looking for soothing body butters that moisturize. Well this stuff is not even close. and should not be considered by anyone with very dry skin. It goes on smooth and then disappears. never to be felt again. My skin sucked it right in and was dry again in about 10 minutes. There is a reason why it states on the label to apply twice a day. but it still didn't make a difference. Its an ultra liquified lotion.I'm happy it worked for other people. but like Marissa. it did not work for me. For the record. I bought Nivea Essentially Enriched body cream. I love it! Its greasy at first. but my skin is soft. smooth. and STAYS moisturized all day. AND you only have to apply it once."
1,"I bought this lotion after a friend recommended it.  After my first use. the ammonia smell was too much to bear....it cut clear through my clogged nasal passages (I have a really bad cold).  Perhaps I should have known this ammonia scent would happen since ammonium lactate is the 2nd listed ingredient...but for some reason. I did not review the ingredients list so it didn't even occur to me.  This lotion is so very expensive that I expected something different.  Due to the very prominent ammonia smell. I couldn't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.  Surely there is a more pleasant way to exfoliate and moisturize."
1,"I live in the southwest and had pretty dry skin so my doctor recommended I try this stuff.  After about a week of use. once a day every day. I notice an obvious difference in my skin.  Areas that were dry and peeling aren't anymore and my skin is noticeably softer.  I ordered this size because I like lotions that have a pump. I find I used them more frequently and the bottle isn't as messy. and this one is no exception.  I would certainly recommend this product!"
1,"Yes. this stuff stinks. I think one of my pharmacy customers said it best: 'It makes me smell like Chicken in a Biskit crackers.' BUT. all alpha hydroxy acid products have a distinct. somewhat unpleasant smell. If your alpha hydroxy acid product doesn't stink. it probably doesn't have much (or any) alpha hydroxy acid in it.I guess they could try to cover it up with heavy fragrance. but that's never a good idea for a product used for treating skin conditions. The stink does fade after a few minutes. but if you apply it heavily. it will still be detectable for a few hours.I don't like how thick this is. but that's just a personal preference. Many people will enjoy the texture.Works well for keratosis pilaris. if you use it religiously. Helps dry rough feet a bit. but mostly if you start off with a clean slate (get rid of the corns/calluses first)."
1,"I have extremely dry skin and was constantly itching and scratching. sometimes actually causing bleeding. I tried AmLactan Mosturizing Body Lotion and FINALLY got some relief from the constant scratching. It took about four days to completely stop all the scratching. I used the product just once a day. even though the directions say to apply twice daily. Now my skin is soft and silky feeling and the scabs from bleeding have disappeared. The ammonia like smell of older bottles that I have used is no longer present. They seem to have improved the formulation. It's now completely odor free. I just found the 20 ounce size on sale at Costco.com for $15.49 including shipping. I will never stop using this product. It works just as advertized. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin and itching. Visit the manufacturers website at amlactin.com for more information and you can even sign up for their newsletter. I'm a fan FOREVER!"
1,"I got this form my local store because of an article I read. It works great on feet and body. I had a bad callus on my food - I know. disgusting. sorry. BUT I used this every night for about a week before it began to disappear. It makes my feet soft and absolutely amazing. HOWEVER. if you have cracked heels or calluses. they will come back if you do not use this lotion continuously. I guess that's the downside of it. I found this out the hard way when I stopped using it once my feet felt like velvet.Just so you know the generic name for this is Ammonium Lactate Topical. Exactly same stuff. but... cheaper."
1,"My dermatologist recommended I use this lotion for extremely dry skin.  (I don't have any other skin conditions. so please keep that in mind if you are considering using this product for a specific issue other than dry skin.)I've been using it twice a day for about 5 days and am totally impressed with the results.  My skin was VERY dry and VERY itchy. and this lotion has completely eliminated those symptoms.  My skin feels great. and I'm not constantly itching and fidgeting!My only complaint is that the lotion is tacky when applied.  This little feature is annoying. but not bad enough to make my stop using the lotion.  I highly recommend this lotion for super dry skin."
1,"I have a moderate case of KP that seems to be getting worse with age.  I bought this lotion at the store a week ago and after using it for just a few days. my arms look so much better.  I'm hoping if I continue to use it. the KP will go away completely.  So far. it's the only thing that has helped this condition.  I didn't have very high hopes for it but it is worth a shot if you are suffering from KP."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
1,"Purchased this to use on a thyroidectomy scar immediately after surgery. I used it for a year before giving up. It did provide some relief to the itchy dry feeling of a healing wound but it did nothing to diminish the scar.I also used this on a scar left from severe acne immediately when it was safe to use. It actually made it worse. My scar became beat red. I discontinued use and began to apply aloe gel to the scar. Within one day the redness was gone and the scar began to diminish.There are positive reviews on this product. maybe it will work better for you. It's very expensive. I would recommend trying an aloe gel first. I purchased a large bottle for $3 at Trader Joe's."
1,"My Physical Therapist recommended this to me to help with tissue mobility above the area where I had a plate and screws put into my fibula where I had surgery for a broken bone.  It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible.  It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box.  That said it did accomplish what my PT wanted but I don't give 5 stars because I don't see it as a &#34;must have&#34; or &#34;must buy&#34; which I consider a 5 star rating to be."
1,"I have yet to see if it will improve overall healing of my scar.  I won't know for several months but my initial experience with this product is mediocre.  Only a tiny amount may be applied without having a flaking mess on my skin after it dries.  The box says that it is must be rubbed in well and even that does not keep the flaking away unless only a tiny amount is used at a time.  It forms a film on the skin.I wish I had ordered the mederma with spf in it because whenever I leave the house I have to apply spf anyway.  Consider that when you buy.  Also. you will not need a lot of this product unless you have a large scar to cover.  Consider the smaller tube."
1,"I have big skin grafts. and I stopped using it after 6 months. then began again a year later.  And I saw almost immediate results when I began again.  Even my boyfriend noticed.  I have also been using it on a  section of tattoo that I just got which scarred on a few lines.  In a few months the raised skin came down and it doesn't bother me anymore.  The stuff definitely works.  Too bad its so expensive in stores.  The gel is tough to get out of tube when it gets 1/2 full."
1,"I can assure you a 100% you will not see any improvement in this from 1 tube! Got to help with unsightly stretch marks and thought this might help with them. but knew this would not cure them. I applied the gel as directed to the affected area as directed for 3 months and saw absolutely no improvement in the skin or color of the scars. and the fact that the tube is so small you will not get enough of the gel to last to see any improvement with out several tubes! So I rate this 1 out of 5 stars considering this is but a common snake oil and should not be advertised to help improve stretch marks! And on a side not I would not recommend this to anyone looking to improve the sight of scars or stretch marks!"
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
1,"I had a HUGE newly healed scrape that took up half my forearm and it was starting to scar up in a weird bumpy way.  I wasn't sure if this was really going to work because reviews seemed mixed. but it sounded like the newer the scar is. the better it works.  Honestly. I've been using it for a few weeks (I try for once a day. but I occasionally forget) and the results are AMAZING.  It literally looks better every day.  The weird bump &#34;over scarring&#34; areas were gone after TWO days.  Now my scar had JUST healed.  I started applying it a few days after the last of the scabbing had gone. so I suspect that's why I've had such great luck."
1,"I've used Mederma in the past and it worked really well. Well. I've had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella. I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing. I've been using it for a little over a month.and again it's working. This is good stuff. I saw improvement in a week. Of course I would purchase this again.if fact I'll be doing that real soon. I would recommend this to a friend. I think Mederma deserves more than five stars."
1,"I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing."
1,"Thanks to an accident at the river I ended up with a large scar at my wrist. I have scars over most of my body so it didnt bother me. What did bother me is going to hand cashiers money and them looking down at my wrist and looking back up at me with that 'oh my he tried to' looks. The mederma has smoothed the surface and reduced the red shade by 2/3 after 4 weeks. I'm going to continue using the product for another 4 weeks and see how much better it gets."
1,"I had a hip replaced and my doctor had recommended this product to help reduce scarring since I scar easily.  I had a fairy long and nasty looking scar so I decided to give this a try.  Here is what I found:1.  The cream is easy to apply and goes a long way!2.  The cream does soften the skin area and makes it itch less.3.  After 3 months my scar has reduced noticeably.  Instead of being raised and hard. it is flat and soft.  There is still a red line. but that is fading in places.While this product is definitely not an instant fix. it does work!  I have several scars that I have acquired through the years that while small. look far worse than this major surgery scar does now!  I am quite happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to reduce the amount of scar tissue."
1,"I've used Mederma diligently for a couple of months; it was great in making fresh scars barely visible. but not so great with old scars. It is worth a try. but be prepared to be very disciplined - it won't work if it's not applied at least twice a day. for at least 2-6 months.On the other hand. and to be completely honest. I believe petroleum jelly. aloe vera or other similar skin repair products would have the same results if applied 3-4 times a day. for 3-6 months (as directed for Mederma). since the skin regenerates and changes almost completely within this interval. I'm sorry I can't write a raving review and collect dozens of helpful votes. but this is my honest opinion. I don't want to be a kill-joy. I just wish someone had told me the same so I could save some money."
1,"I use this for cracked heels. cuticle oil. pimples. sunburn. & dry chapped hands and lips.  A little goes a long way. and it absorbs nicely (sometimes takes a few minutes to go away).  I'm always amazed how much better my hands are in the morning when I put e-oil on before I go to bed.  Same with my heels.  The higher IU's is too thick for my tastes. this seems to have the best viscosity for whatever I need it for.  I even put it on a Q-Tip and put it in my nose when I'm getting ready to run the tiller or mow because of the dust.  Keeps me from getting such a nasty sinus headach and has a nice lemony smell compared to the menthol that's for colds and flu.  This is awesome stuff."
1,"I never try vitamin E oil before but I am using vitamin C serum which is good to follow  with vitamin E oil especially at night time for better results. this oil is awesome. I just love it!!! is very rich so just a few drops (2 to 3) covers my entire face. the bottle is small enough which makes it very convenient for traveling. some oils have  a rancid smell. this oil smells a bit like lemon grass it's a pleasure to apply it after my vitamin C serum. leaves my skin so smooth and dewy for the next morning. I highly recommend this product."
1,"Niacin is quite effective in reducing bad cholesterol in your blood. especially in my case. I am sensitive to most statin drugs prescribed by doctors.  The usual downside to it's regular use is flushing from dilating the blood vessels while it is being absorbed.  Slo Niacin has an enteric coating that slows the absorbtion. so that the &#34;flush&#34; is not a problem. It is important to watch the date on the product. as the enteric material loses some of it's effect with time. Slo Niacin is also much less costly than statin drugs."
1,"If you have high LDL cholesterol and you have not been able to reduce it with diet and exercise. this Slo-Niacin tablets will do the job. The slow release minimizes flashing that is normally associated with Niacin and the results are incredible. I have been trying to lower my Cholesterol for the last couple of years but with no success. I was stuck in the range of 230-235 and even though I was taking Flash-Free Niacin. my number was not dropping. Two months ago I found out by reading posts on the Internet that Flash-Free Niacin does not work for lowering cholesterol. So. I started looking for another way and found the Slo-Niacin which is regular niacin that is released slowly. This worked great. I took 1500 mg a day for a month and my cholesterol dropped from 233 to 130.  I was shocked by how well it worked.  It makes you wonder why doctors prescribe drugs when a natural supplement like Niacin works so well."
1,"I used Slo-Niacin for several years before switching to Niaspan (Rx required). I take a heavy dose (1500 MG nightly). After the initial couple of weeks the flushing. hot and itchy skin. occurred only about once a week. With Niaspan. the flushing (etc) happened only 2-3 times per month. Now. my drug plan has raised my cost for Niaspan by 250% !!So. I will be returning to Slo-Niacin--but the cost to me will be only $11.92 per month using Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save.' This is in contrast to the new cost of Niaspan at $50 per month. Therefore. when the itching comes on I will chant a mantra of 'But. I am saving $37 a month!'"
1,"i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well. after just taking it for two days. i had a terrible reaction to it. felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level. so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill. but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
1,"Being constantly anemic. I always dread having to take Iron pills because they leave my stomach so upset.  The Slow Fe tablets are pricey but they are worth it!  No stomach problems associated with iron at all!  My big complaint is that they are extremely hard to open.  It is so time consuming and difficult.  If you have arthritis. opening these will be a nightmare.  I still think the benefits outweigh the cons.  When I am bored. I stand and open 10 or so tablets at a time and put them in a pill box."
1,"OK. so I tried to save some $$ by getting the generic at my local store.  Big mistake.Went back to the doctor and he recommended this brand by name. so I ordered it here because it was cheaper than my drug store.I am on my second box now and it has made a world of difference in how I feel and in my test results.  I always thought generics were just the same as the name brands. but that is not the case for this supplement. I will be buying this brand again"
1,"This product (by Nature's Bounty) claims that there are 1 billion ACTIVE Lactobacilli in the pills. The best established test for ACTIVE Lactobacilli is to give them substrate (warm milk) and let them grow over night. Test Result: Two pills smashed to powder and mixed with warm milk (37'C) did NOT produce any growth (fermentation) overnight!. That means that Nature's Bounty is selling us Cellulose + Fructose flavored with strawberry. Should have done this test earlier. Will never buy from Nature's Bounty again. And will start testing one after another other vendors. Hope there will be a product for real?!"
1,"For the most part. I like certain kinds of yogurt. but I find that I just can't eat it every day.  I don't like it THAT much.  But I do want to take steps to keep my digestive system on track. and these small. sweet acidophilus chews are a great way to do just that.  I actually take one every day. even if I do eat yogurt.  Plus. the price cannot be beat.  It's always great to be able to consume things that are good for you without totally breaking the bank."
1,"The joke is that this deodorant is not the one we received. even though we wanted this one. Yes. I am aware that I am not rating the correct product. but another Speed Stick (the one that comes in white and smears. and was the last one we wanted) product. Makes anyone upset to order an specific product and receive a totally different product instead. That is why the 1 Star review. For if someone chooses this product and receives one they did not order. I think that would warrant a star. Noticed this has happened more than once. according to other reviewers. and that is Baloney. because what it means is that someone in a warehouse is substituting products at their whim.I know the actual product is great. exactly what we wanted. but since it is deceiving in showing the picture when there are no intentions on delivering that product. I give this one 2 Stars at most."
1,"Wow!! Great price for this pack of six 3.25 sticks of deodorant. Mennen surprised me with this musk deodorant & the quality of it.This deodorant is long lasting & works very well in all situations. This goes on clear & leaves no type of stain on any type of shirt. One stick is long lasting even after applying it several times a day.This is a great way to stock up at an affordable price. I am very.very particular about what I buy & use but could not find anything negative to say about this item."
1,"I've been using Speed Stick deodorant regular for years.  It is effective at killing stink.  It has a nice smell when you apply it.  The smell is not overpowering and it is not noticeable after a few minutes (I have smell sensitivity).  This product does not stain clothes or leave any marks.  I tried Tom's and Trader Joe's natural deodorant but neither of those worked and I could smell my own BO long before the day was over.  While I like to buy products that have no animal testing. I draw the line with BO and use my Speed Stick deodorant.  It's great for men or women and it's inexpensive."
1,"I've used Speed Stick before in the past and had a good experience. So. when buying online I figured I'd stick with a brand that I know will not make me break out. Well. it did not make me break out. however. the odor protection is not what I remember it to be. I really like the smell of the musk Speed Stick. Probably one of my favorite smelling deodorants. Kind of a manly cologne or aftershave scent. not too strong but every now and then you'll get a whiff and it smells great. Unfortunately. the odor protection does not last all day. Probably only last about half the day and by the end of the day I can definitely tell it isn't working anymore. I still give it three stars though for the scent."
1,"I only use this aftershave in the summer because it tends to dry my skin in the brutal Chicago winter. It works great after a nice straight razor shave; smells great and cools my skin. It's alcohol-based. but I'm surprised it doesn't sting as much as I expected. Since the dispensing hole is a bit too big. I cover half of it with my thumb before squirting it into my hand. One day. a female acquaintance hugged me and commented I smelled really good. Two weeks later she asked me out ;)"
1,"My husband is very picky about shave gels. primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin.  My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack. even though the price was under $3 a can with super saver shipping.  He is not happy with this product.  He's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products. namely. Gillette Fusion. which he prefers.  Also. insofar as use on his sensitive skin. the gel is only so-so.  The fragrance is okay with him.  However. what he particularly doesn't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide.  Now we have about four cans left. which he will grudgingly use. unless I can find him a deal on Fusion.  He's encouraging me to find one...soon."
1,"Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results. you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!"
1,"This Ultra Brite Advanced Whitening toothpaste I purchase in my local store and find it to be a superb toothpaste better than the fancy and more expensive brands.+ This cleans and foams up better in the mouth than the other brands.+ Cleans and WHITENENS better than the expensive kind I have found.+ Works great with a Spinbrush or Oral B Rechargeable toothbrush. Noticed that the Oral B one and this toothpaste work superbly together as my teeth shine and look whiter and cleaner!- For me. since I have somewhat sensitive teeth. so I use this every other day (for whitening abilities) and I use Sesodyne toothpaste on the alternate days. This works for me and keeps my sensitive teeth happy and with no sensitivity at the same time.Highly recommend this!"
1,"We use this toothpaste for two reasons; it works and it's inexpensive. We normally keep multiple boxes of this toothpaste around the house and at this point probably have around five or six unopened boxes in reserve.The toothpaste has a pleasant taste and is only moderately foamy which. in my opinion. simplifies the whole tooth brushing process.As another reviewer has pointed out a consumer testing organization has given the toothpaste high marks; that I'll have to admit was the reason I first bought this brand. According to the box the product is made in Mexico and distributed in the USA by Colgate-Palmolive. It contains sodium fluoride .24 % for anticavity protection.We have been pleased with this product for years and see no reason to change."
1,"Now how often do THOSE two words go together? Not that often in a toothpaste! Consumer Reports got me to try Ultra Brite but the results keep my buying it. I've been using it for years and personally I've never noticed any whitening effects *but* it makes my teeth feel clean and maintains a healthy mouth. Rarely any dental issues here in years. My teeth look great and I frequently get compliments on my smile. These days I use a whitening paste half the time but I keep Ultra Brite in the rotation too.UB has a nice minty taste that is not totally over powering - meaning I can actually taste food again within the hour. The paste is a nice consistency and doesn't produce too much foam even with my Oral B electric toothbrush. The price can't be beat - usually a dollar or less locally.Very pleased with this product and highly recommended."
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
1,"I ordered this a year ago for my grandmother who has arthritis & bruises easily.  Once she tried it. there was no other alternative that worked as good for her (she was using other topical creams & some burned her skin. or left a rash).  This soaks in quickly. doesn't burn or irritate the skin & actually does lighten her bruises within a couple days of using this day & night (she bumps into anything & a bruise starts. Immediately she puts this on & the bruise either doesn't happen or it fades away in a couple days).Now I am ordering again because I use this before & after workouts. when I get bruises and also to ease out the swelling & redness of acne on my face (yes. just 2 times a day on clean skin I rub this in & within a week my large. angry acne marks are gone).This stuff works quickly on pain. doesn't stain. is all natural & we could not be happier in my home using this product."
1,"Of course everyone has a different response to treatments but this has been the go to gel for minor scraps & bruises for the family.It's amazing as upon immediate application its soothes the wound and eases pain.all while healing and lessening the presence of a scar.It's a must for first aide kits and medicine cabinets especially if you have kids.I even used it on minor burns and yes. it works like a charm.Gr8 product!!Also if you have body aches.cramps or muscle pain try arnica tabletsArnica Montana 30x 250 Tabletsnow these little tablets out weigh any other pain relief tablet OTC."
1,"I grabbed this for my natural first aid kit- I use it fairly often now since its great for diminishing the pain and appearance of bruises as well as great for sore backs and hands resulting from yard work or-ahem-a tough camping trip...My son is nearly 2 and gets bruises from regular toddler antics. it is nice to know I can help the bruises go away faster- especially when we know we will be attending an event where photos will be taken...My husband only needs one application for a sore back. I used it on a smashed finger with good results- only needed it a few times to make the throbbing go away and the pain subside.the only side effect/gross part is that this can loosen dead skin-probably has alcohol in it-and the skin or other dirt and grime will pill up and swirl around on the surface when you massage this in. Yuck.but this is effective and naturally based -its just a nice product to have on hand or in your first aid kit."
1,"Hey. I am a born skeptic.  But I think that this product actually works.  And it is easy to apply.  The only down side is a somewhat unpleasant aroma. but away from the nose this does not matter.  My pain is most often in the lower back.  If I apply the gel and then sit in a chair that encourages good posture. the pain is relieved within a quarter hour.  If you have tried cooling compounds. heating compounds. etc.. and do not have a solution for pain yet. try this gel. and hopefully it will work for you as it does for me."
1,"Never would I think something so topical could work on my deep down 'what the heck did I do to cause this' back pain - but WOW.  I put it on about 2 hours ago and I don't hurt now.  Pretty amazing.  This tube is HUGE for the price. there is no smell. no sticky - it absorbs and goes right to work.  I'm no organic-shmanic gal here... I don't buy into the 'natural is better' crowd (few. but we're out here) - still - this product floored me.  It works.  I wish I'd known about it years ago.  And this is the best value anywhere.  I'm using it for muscle pain and stiffness.  You should too."
1,"Have used this Homeopathic gel for decades. As a professionally trained Modern. and Classical Ballet. dancer for over 30 + years. I have sworn by this for preventative as well as helping to speed-up recovery/healing time of sports-type & over-use injuries. Ii is essential to us dancers and athletes alike. Great for contusions. bruises and over-use injuries. Recommend. Only remember to remove all oils and perfumes from skin BEFORE using. and to be diligent enough to use in the morning and evening both. for best results."
1,"I bruise easily. and they last forever (sometimes months).  This will make my bruise disappear within a week.  The one thing I've noticed is that while the bruise will disappear. the area may still be sore like a normal bruise (although the soreness won't last as long as a normal bruise).  Definitely worth the effort and cost!!!  I had gum surgery several years ago. which is where I learned of this.  I applied both the topical gel. and took the small pellets both before and after surgery.  My jaw never bruised (which was a miracle in itself). and had minimal swelling which went away in a couple days."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
1,"I have been lifting for about 3 years now (benching about 95lbs when I started) and about a year ago I hit a wall where I could not seem to increase my max anymore.  So then about 6 months ago I started using muscle milk. glutamine powder. BCAA pills. and this Creatine Fuel.  When Before I started this regimen I was maxing out on the bench at about 185 and just last week I did 245 for the first time and I have increased in pretty much every other area as well.  I have also noticed that my arms look and feel much fuller. they are up to 16 inches now and I hope to continue my journey and maybe someday in the next year hit the 300 mark on bench and make good gains in other areas as well."
1,"i can't say this stuff work wonders.but I can't say that it doesn't help. Consistency is the key to all work outs and lower calorie intake. There those who truly believe in this product So don't take my review to heart. It could work for you better then other people everyone is different and since we all have different metabolism and health system it will work wonders for some and for some it won't. this is a case of try for yourself and see if it works for you.  Since individual result may (will) vary."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I have read from a lot of people saying it doesn't leave you groggy but if I take more than half a teaspoon I find it makes me that way.  I don't take melatonin unless I cant sleep at all or if I am not tired but it starts to work pretty fast no matter how much I take.  I guess since its a liquid it affects you quicker since I have used the pill form before.  My 3 year old who is autistic has problems sleeping and staying asleep and as far as getting to sleep she will usually go to sleep in about 10 to 15 minutes.  This was recommended over medication from our doctor which is what we prefer.  She still wakes up some nights but I don't think it has too much to do with the melatonin as it is with her.  Overall I recommend this to help people sleep naturally without resorting to medication."
1,"We have been giving this to my grandson for over a week and find that it helps to calm him down.  We give it to him about an hour before bed and it helps him to go to sleep at night instead of 11:00pm or later.  It has a 'sweet' taste so he takes it readily. Now everyone get get some rest.  He has not been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD but is a very active little boy.  I would definitely recommend it.  FYI: we are also giving him Synaptol twice a day which seems to take the 'edge' off during the day.  This has relatively no taste at all."
1,"These caplets are fine to swallow and have everything I need in them.  My doctor told me I was low on iron so I've been trying different vitamins with Iron in them.  In these vitamins though is an additive that turns my urine to bright yellow no matter how much water I drink.  I don't care for that.  I went to the doctor to see if I was having a bladder or kidney problem and all is well.  The doctor told me it was the food coloring that they put in them.  Why do that?"
1,"I used to get nauseous every day. and couldn't figure out why. I would feel fatigued and get dizzy spells also. I had tried other multi-vitamins before. and couldn't tell any difference so I stopped taking vitamin supplements. Then I started taking this one. and I stopped getting nausous. and I find that I can think more clearly and have a more sustained energy throughout the day compared to days that I don't take it. I have been taking this for a couple of years now and I'm very satisfied."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
1,"Consumer groups have a lot of info on line about which vitamins are most effectively absorbed.I'll save you the pain of what I went through reviewing the top 100 vitamins out there:Efficacy of vitamins ranges over a wide scale. The best cost perhaps $3 a day to use. The worst do the job 10% or less as well as the best ones. Name brand rarely coincides with effectiveness.These are powder in a capsule. so they absorb rapidly and do their job well. Cost is reasonable. too.What I found after a lot of research. was these occupy a unique niche between the dollars-a-day designer vitamins and the pennies a day junk. offering nearly the performance of the former at nearly the price of the latter.Enjoy! It's great having quality vitamins and not paying exorbitant prices.Recommended - and used - for years. 'It's all the vitamin you'll ever need!'To your health!"
1,"I've always found it difficult to decipher the pro's and con's of daily vitamin consumption.  The only thing I can offer is over the last month or so I've noticed a slight reduction in energy and focus.  Overall I still feel decently healthy. however. it recently dawned on me that about 3 weeks ago I stopped taking these daily vitamins b/c my supply ran dry.  Now it wouldn't be right to contribute this reduction in energy solely on the demise of my vitamin consumption but it would be safe to say it's very possible these vitamins may have been benefiting me all along.  I'm placing another order regardless :)"
1,"I started using this in combination with Raspberry Ketones and found it made me stronger in my workouts. I have also been able to keep weight off with it. But remember. nothing is a miracle pill. I use it in combination with regular workouts and watch what I eat. I keep track of calories and always expend more calories than I use. If you are not wanting to loose weight then taking this along with the Keytones about 30 minutes prior to workout should help you to be able to move more weight."
1,"I've been taking CLA for about 5 weeks.  I'm quite obese and I've noticed that my belly fat is shrinking more than usual when I'm restricting calories. I am eating about 1800 calories a day for the last four months and losing about 3-4 lbs a month.  That is fine since I've lost hundreds of lbs. over the years and always gained it back.  What I'm hoping is that I won't gain it back this time; that I can just continue eating the same. 1800. and my body. which fights me to gain. will be happy with the lower weight.  One weird thing that I have noticed is that when I take Tylenol. it's doesn't work anymore.  I take it 2-3 times a week for arthritis.  I can't take NSAIDS so that is unfortunate."
1,"I purchased this product because I have decided to be in TOTAL GREAT HEALTH. I did not want to start off with anything that would give me the shakes or have me feeling weird or bad. I wanted something natural to help with my stomach fat. I can say that I have changed my diet. smoothie in the mornings. water all day. and a full course meal with protein and vegetables. no bread and no sugar. walking every day for 30-45 minutes. I have have seen a tremendous result. I feel much better and I am determined to obtain total health."
1,"I enjoy that one soft gel is a serving. For me this was a good value. especially with being 1200mg per serving as opposed to something were you have to swallow 2 or 3 pills for the same serving.This is a very effective form of CLA with Tonalin and for the price it isn't bad. However. if foul smells bother you. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The bottle I received left such a strong odor in the room long after I took my pill and closed the jar. that I cannot take it out of the house.It's effectiveness and ease to take is great. it just really needs to stop smelling so foul.PROS:Simple to takeEasy on stomachEasy to swallowEffectiveCONS:Bad flavorBad Smell"
1,"Pros:-Small-Great stats (high in protein and calories relative in size)-The Chocolate and Mocha Chip tastes Great-No chalky tasteCons:-Fiance thinks they taste awefulBefore I bought this product I always thought Balance bars were low in protein and just a womans meal supplement.  Well. now they are my main protein bars and eat them all the time between meals when I am hungry.I would give these a 5 star. best nutritional/protein bars I have ever tried.  No chalky taste. very smooth texture (overly smooth compared to others) however. the fiance hated them.  Not sure why. but she could not even eat them. however. she loves the Cliff bar brand."
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
1,"I'm always the type that needs to snack on items through the day to avoid headaches and feeling fatigue.  I'm very physically active and don't have time to spend for large meals so need something filling. easy to take with me. and is delicious.  The chocolate craze is essentially like a desweetened chocolate bar for me.  I just can't tire of the taste. it's the best I've ever had with these nutritional bars.  I only wish they were cheaper as it's quite pricey.  But as the saying. you do get what you pay for."
1,"Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars. this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar. chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it. and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information. these bars do have a lot of protein (15g). but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
2,"This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup. 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen."
2,"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color. and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated. of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored. foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book. and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies. and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!"
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
2,"My daughter 1 year old really likes this book.  I bought it because of its similarity to the 10 little ladybugs book.  It has the same sort of colorful illustrations and I like it better as the ladybugs are not as pretty as the sparkly butterflies.  This book teaches colors as each of the butterflies finds a place to stay for the night.Update - My daughter is now well grown but this book sticks in my mind still - we read it so many times.  I would say it was one of her very favorites when she was young."
2,"So I actually bought this thinking it was the entire Lesson 2 kit. However. I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book."
2,"It took me about 40 minutes to read this lesson plan thoroughly; while it is inexpensive at under five dollars. I still don't know if that is necessarily a good value. As some reviewers have pointed out. much of the book focuses on advertising Wilton products; without all of this the useful material in the book could have been condensed down to a couple of pages. I did like the photographs and the techniques for making different consistencies of buttercream for different uses. I had initially planned on getting the subsequent lesson plans as well. but I don't think it will be worth it. If you have any skill/experience with cake decorating at all. I'd recommend skipping this book."
2,"This Wilton book is awesome.  My local craft shop did not offer the fondant course when I wanted to take it so I decided to teach myself.  I followed the lessons in the book and my fondant cakes have improved greatly.  In my area the Wilton Method instructors are not so great so I am happy I was able to save the money on the class but still get all of the wonderful Wilton advice.  I would definitely recommend not only buying this book. but seeing how much you can teach yourself before spending the money on the class."
2,"I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner. I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set. that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas. from Amazon.that work very well. I also bought the bench knife. and found a 16' cake lifter. and a 18' cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon. however. the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book. great starter outer! Oh yes. I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely.Super Chef David"
2,"I ordered this lesson plan because I took the first two courses of Wilton's Cake Decorating. and I didn't want to sign up for the 3rd course only because I didn't want to spend so much money for the classes. So I bought the kit in Michaels figuring I would teach myself but this time the lesson plan wasn't included in kit like the first 2 kits were. This lesson plan is great and if you have some experience with working with fondant and gum paste this will be a piece of cake for you. no pun intended. But this definitely isn't for a beginner."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
2,"I absolutely love this book! Before purchasing. I found myself gathering bits and pieces of information from the wilton site to make the flowers and borders that I wanted. but this book puts them all together neatly without leaving anything out. I recently purchased Colette's Cakes which is also wonderful. but so much of it is advanced. and I'm just not there. I only decorate for fun. This book sticks to basics which. for me. is essential to focus. If I see to much detail I tend to become frustrated and over anxious. Then I end up giving up. So. with this book I can actually follow the process and learn step by step without the frustration.The only small disappointment was the weight of the cover. The paper is a bit thin and will need some support or will probably not hold up very well. Nothing a little clear contact paper can't cure though. so no big deal."
2,"I've always loved cake decorating. ever since I took my first Wilton class.  Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.  The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.  It's a lot of fun but. I admit. a bit frustrating.  No matter how closely I follow the steps. my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.  I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book. as all Wilton Lesson Plans. it's great."
2,"This is an ok book for a new cake decorator. It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However. the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for 'cake decorating ideas' when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly. if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it."
2,"I'm a Star Wars fan and I bought this with the intention of using it for groceries but it turned into my new diaper bag. It's huge! I can fit everything i need in it where before I had my diaper bag and another bag and my purse. It has started to come apart on the side but I can sew it or order a new one it's so cheap. I am sure the intended purpose isn't for it to be used as a diaper bag daily but it works and I have gotten compliments on it even! It goes great with my Star Wars Vans too :D"
2,"I used to date this girl who loved Scrabble.  So. by association. I had to as well!  We used to play a lot - even with her Grandmother.  What they did. however. was 'cheat'.  We had one of these - this same Franklin Spelling Corrector you see here (an older model but same nonetheless) and you each of us was allowed to use it to come up with all kinds of crazy words.  I thought this was a dumb way to play Scrabble. at first. but then I came to love it.  If you're all 'cheating'. then it becomes a different game - the strategy changes.  We had a lot of fun.  Too bad I had to dump her for being utterly insane! (I'm sure she was bipolar-scitzophrenic or some variant thereof).  I kept the Franklin Spelling Corrector!  Still have it to this day!"
2,"Had my doubts that this would hold a 300 page paper back book because it's kinda thick and therefore stiff... NO Problem and the adjustable part of this holder is that the two parts that actually hold the book swivel so you can move them in or out to accommodate the size of book.... SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.  I am using it to take notes for study.  Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it... could not turn the pages.  This is a winner"
2,"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback. it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it."
2,"I use this for everything from propping up cookbooks in the kitchen to reading hardcovers at my desk while eating my lunch.  Most recently I've been using it for my Kindle 2.  Works great for everything. but a little tricky for some paperbacks because they slip around a little bit.  It does work best with the average-sized hardcover (think novel- sized).  Folds up nice and fits well in a drawer or in the front pocket of my backpack.  Definitely a handy thing to have around."
2,"This is a really convenient book stand if you like to read outside of home and don't have larger books. If you don't necessarily need the portability or if you have large/tall textbooks I would suggest you look at something more study as this tends to tip over/make indentations on the bottom of pages for those books. Also you can increase the height of the stand by pulling  up part of the metal frame. but even with doing this it doesn't really support larger books well enough to easily highlight."
2,"This is as described but for some reason. I was still expecting it to be a little larger. I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices. sandwiches. cucumbers. etc.  It's the perfect size for what I wanted.  You could also use it as a form for making pancakes. etc but they would be very small!  I wouldn't use it as a cookie cutter but my family makes double the size of the average cookie.  Maybe for mini cookies this would work..."
2,"I was leery about spending tis much for the Tupperware brand name product. but I wanted to upgrade to covered ice cube trays for use in our RV and didn't feel comfortable with some of the negative reviews I read of lower cost brands (mainly the plastic cracking after a few months use).  Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit. finish. and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!  I've already gotten tossed out the original open plastic ice cube trays which were just aggravating."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
2,"I had looked high and low for a 1 ounce souffle cup and lid set for our lunchboxes.  The only ones I could find were disposable. and I strive to make our lunches completely trash free.  (See some of my other reviews)The Smidgets are the perfect size for salad dressings. little candy treats or marshmallows. raisins. nuts...if it's little. it flies!  You'll love them.  I followed the tip from another Amazon reviewer and boiled them for 1 minute then re-sealed them while they are still hot to make the lids easier to take on and off.  Worked like a charm."
2,"I take vitamins. Most containers aren't big enough to hold them. These are perfect.* They have plenty of room - I don't have to methodically arrange my vitamins to allow the lid to close. I estimate these will hold around 20 big vitamins. 9/9/11 Update: I just attached an image showing this with 16 vitamins. I think it would hold 20 if you work at it. With 16. I can just drop them in and pop the lid on.* They are compact enough to fit into a jeans pocket.Yep. the lid is hard to get off the first couple of times. No worries after that. The bonus is that a snug lid means I don't worry about them opening and spilling my vitamins. Nice!My daughter loves these in her purse. too.The uses are practically endless (aspirin. gum. paper clips. skittles :)HIGHLY Recommended!"
2,"Here in Penna. we make pickled eggs. also known here as red beet eggs.  I use this container for that.  The square shape makes it fit neatly in the back corner of my fridge.  The lid fits well; the strainer is sturdy.  I've had mine for five to ten years. and it is still good as new.  I just bought one for my mother.  She had her red beets eggs in a jar. which cracked spilling red juice all over the bottom of her firidge.  I have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh.  I think this would also work to marinate a few pieces of chicken.  I also know someone who uses hers. without the strainer. to store brown sugar.  So. it is a multi-purpose container."
2,"You most definitely get what you pay for. these are very cheap and have already started to show signs of rusting after just a couple of months.  Also look carefully at the fork and knife. they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.  The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.  The spoons are also very disproportionate if you look at the little spoon it is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I hate to say it but I was not impressed with Ikea in this case. I had to buy a whole new set to replace this one."
2,"I was doubtful about getting two sets of these. but I am glad I did.  They are just right for children.  They don't hold all that much fluid so if there is a spill...and there is ALWAYS a spill...it isn't so bad.  I put them in the dishwasher on the top shelf.  They've been holding up well.  We've had a couple left in weird places that ended up holding science experiments but they washed up just fine. Get them.  They're terrific for families."
2,"were expecting . 1st off let me say this . it's made in China . It's smaller than your average lunch box and has no lil' drink bottle inside  either . Also the latch is plastic and although it's holding i've got my doubts as to it's longevity for my grandson . The box itself is however tin and although i like that it's metal . it's unbelievable thing metal and poorly hinged with simple folded over tangs or flaps as i'd call em that link it to the other and that's for sure not all that secure . As for the pro's or positives to this lil' box . it's Curious George and all kids love or loved his cute lil' monkey shennanigans at some point and time . The artwork is pretty well done and seemingly durable thus far . The price of course was a plus and sadly i'm realizing that we've got what we've paid for ..."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
2,"I've been using this almost daily for about a month. Easy to use. easy to clean. and looks nice on the counter. No real complaints. except that the bowl feels kind of thin. like it would crack easily. I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier. I hope I'm wrong about the bowl. but I guess only time will tell. Other than that. no complaints. and I'd recommend buying this!Update 6/27/13: After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up. and it's still doing what it's supposed to do. My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube. Obviously I knew this when I purchased it. but hindsight is 20/20."
2,"I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother's feeding tube.  She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition. but does well with her customary food.  I tried using a blender. but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.  We have used the Cuisinart I purchased when they were first introduced to the USA. which worked well but was inconvenient for on-the-spot use and for travel.  I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the 'cheaper' one.  I am impressed with its performance. ease of use and compact size.  It is clearly worth the small price I paid.  I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.  It is perfect for my intended use. and I can envision how to use it in cooking. I highly recommend it."
2,"well i'm not impressed because all it is.is a mini food processor. nothing spectacular as they all work the same. I did like the fact that I could get it in a different color which was blue. I thought I would use it more but I have only used it a couple of times. I still like my bigger food processor and feel I may have wasted my money buying it. it probably would be great for an older person who doesn't need the big food processor and only needs to chop up small stuff."
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
2,"This is a good little machine with limitations.  it is very cheaply made.  no question about it.  I expect it will last a few months.  BUT. for the price I can either get it replaced or just keep buying new ones.  Not the best consumer mentality. but I think that's how it's going to be.  It IS very small.  I had anticipated making sauces with it but even for small meals you need to do it in several batches.  I tried shredding vegetables in it and it nipped away at the outer skin of it but left me with some round balls of vegetable matter that required quite a bit of shifting.  It's easy to clean and while it has quite a few drawbacks. I see this getting much more use than my larger machines because of it's overall ease."
2,"I received this as a present and was convinced I wouldn't find a use for it.  Much to my surprise I love it!  It sets on the counter next to my DLC7-Pro.  It is a whiz for chopping a cup ful of nuts for a recipe. making quick bread crumbs for meatloaf. chopping herbs and making dressings.  The blade reverses for chopping or mixing so make sure to have the side up you want for the task at hand.  It is easy to use and a breeze to clean.  I just pop the soiled parts in the dishwasher and forget it.  I would not want to be a day with out this tiny wonder."
2,"This is a MINI processor. and that's why I bought it...NOT to do the big jobs. I have the 'big boy' to do that.  I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs. so I don't have to use the big one.  I use it a lot to make home made dressing.  Clean up is easy and quick. as is the machine.  It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices. etc. however...but it states that in the manual."
2,"I bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking. It does a fairly decent job with the spices although you need to have at least 1/4 cup for it to work well. As to the herbs perhaps I'm doing something wrong but it did not do as well. The herbs that were above the blade stayed put and it took a lot of scraping the bowl to get them chopped up. An addition of something solid (perhaps an onion or a some butter) would probably take care of the problem but just the leaves on their own give this processor a hard time."
2,"I have had this cuisinart for about 2 years now. and it is still going strong.  I have been impressed by its ability to chew through large volumes of basil when making pesto. and small things like sesame seeds for making tahini.  It is also perfect for grinding cookies for pie crusts.  And the size means you don't have to be using a large volume to get great results.  I don't think this mini prep eliminates the usefulness of a full-size cuisinart. but it sure is much easier to clean up when you only need to process 1-2 cups of something."
2,"I find it a little difficult to get the get the consistency I want.  Some things get liquefied if the chunks are too big and I want to try for a little smaller.  What I wind up with is liquid -- but still with some chunks in it!  That. for me is not too bad; I just wanted it for small amounts where hand slicing/chopping wouldn't do the job.  I have had the Cuisinart Mini-Prep for three-and-a-half years and used it again. tonight. for the first time in two years!  Then I remembered why I had not used it.  The parts have too many small grooves and recesses which just do not wash cleanly -- easily.  After brushing and scrubbing the disassembled parts I find that to get off all the small smears of food I have to resort to Q-Tips to get the numerous little. tight angles and grooves clean.  It's a  hygiene horror!"
2,"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers. and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position. so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well. the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine. so it's useless.On top of the danger. it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!"
2,"I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming. A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s. That one lasted around 12 years(!!!) I just burned-out my second one: and now I'm here to buy my third! It's very easy to operate. even for a quad!!It really works fast and the processing mechanism is made well. I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds. and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy."
2,"Then go with the Ninja Master Prep. I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant. so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed. but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades. two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit."
2,"I wore out my original one. so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads. and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad. I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor. and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you. and I like small pieces of carrot in salads. not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces. dressing. and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one. except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking."
2,"I love this little guy!  I use it for just about everything!  I make salad dressing all the time. and yesterday I made topping for a cherry crumble.  Easy to use. easy to clean!  I never put any of the parts in the dishwasher. I think its ok to do so. but from past experience. these sort of items tend to wear out more quickly if they are subject to the heat of dishwasher drying. so I don't do it.  This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.  Great for gifts too!"
2,"Cuisinart. I thought. built quality products. Then they started manufacturing this mess that they call a blender. What a stretch to call it a blender! It needs help to puree the ingredients for a smoothie (you must frequently STIR the ingredients yourself.) The blade assembly eventually cracked. There is now a black residue around the black whirly thing on the base. My husband thinks that it over heated. All that damage from making SMOOTHIES?! Yep. Cuisinart take note-I AM NOT BUYING CUISINART PRODUCTS AGAIN. I would venture to guess others feel the same. I'm happy that some folks had a good experience with this 'blender' but I am not one of them."
2,"In my humble opinion. most of blenders are not great.  The motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit. I've burned through a couple of cheap Hamilton Beach ones.  So if you are doing a lot of entertaining. you might want to look at a commercial one.Use your head.  You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down. Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients. Also. you should look at the recipe book.  The recipe book gives you hints on how to 'layer' the ingredients.I made some awesome hummus by following their directions.As I said earlier. if you are doing heavy blending work with ice you may need a professional unit.  I have heard some of the high end Warings fit the bill."
2,"I'd lower my number of stars. but can't because this is an edit of a previous review.  I had this blender for four years (an admittedly long time. but I used it very rarely).  I noticed after a year or so that there were fine black plastic bits on the base of the blender.  After a few more years of use the plastic mechanism in the base of the unit that spins the blades split in two.My husband and I were going to throw it in the trash. but then felt a wave of guilt about how in our consumeristic culture we never repair things anymore. etc.  So he went online and ordered the broken part for $[...].  When he tried to replace it we realized that an interior screw had become stripped and it was impossible to remove the broken piece.  THEN we threw it in the trash and bought an Osterizer. which doesn't have any plastic moving parts."
2,"I love the blender portion.  It works great at crushing ice and other items.  The food processor is another story.  Works to chop up and blend items. but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it.  With each use. the noise is louder and so irritating.  I am extremely disappointed that I can't use the processor portion of it.  As much as I love the blender. I can't recommend the purchase because you won't be able to use the processor without ear plugs."
2,"This blender replaced a Sunbeam I had for 30 years.  The jar is oversized and supported by small blades placed in a small opening at the base of vessel. isolated from the mass inside. It takes forever to blend anything smooth.  After operating the motor for more than a few moments it begins to emit a strong burning smell.  The plastic drive assembly for the blades snapped off in the first week of use.  Cuisinart replaced one free.  The second one cost about twenty dollars.  I would not recommend this blender. there are better choices."
2,"This is a great blender that's gotten a bad rap. I've owned this model for years and it outperforms all others for my specific task: pureeing Progresso's Manhattan Clam Chowder. The ice crushers don't liquefy the clam pieces. The Cuisinart purees their little hearts out. The mechanical construction is still the Achilles heel but if I can get 2-3 years daily service for 59 bucks. I'm good.Btw. Progresso Manhattan Clam Chowder is a watery mess from the can. Once it's throughly blended. like a shrimp bisque. it's a world class soup. I'd put it up against anything in a top restaurant. I've had one can a day for twenty years. Unfortunately. this doesn't work for other Progresso soups (they're already too thick). Another stroke of genius: blending pea soup with vegetable soup. but this only works for mid-price restaurant soups."
2,"Worked great for the three months that it functioned.  I liked the glass jar and it made great smoothies.  It was powerful and never bogged down.  Then it just quit working.  It is made in China and of apparently poor quality.  Too expensive to buy one every three months.  I would look for something with better reviews.I changed my review on this from one star to four stars because the manufacturer stands by there product.  They replaced the blender with no hassles.  However. it still broke after three months so you should be careful."
2,"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry). we did not have 'proof of purchase' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer 'service' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service."
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
2,"Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker. With a only 6 months of service. the grind mechanism bound and couldn't be removed. Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee (I did have to pay shipping charges!) Less than a year later a repeat performance. Again. I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine. Well you know what happened!  The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita's!"
2,"I've had two of these machines.  The first one lasted almost 2 years and made outstanding coffee.  The second one makes absolutely terrible coffee.  I have come to the conclusion that this second machine doesn't get the water hot enough so the coffee is weak and bitter no matter what I do.  The temp in the carafe at the conclusion of brewing is only 150 degrees.  I spent so much time and money thinking it was my error. but now I'm fairly sure it isn't my fault.If you get a good one it's great. but the one I have now makes undrinkable coffee.  I bought a refurbished one the second time around. I'll never make that mistake again.  There's a reason why those products are so much cheaper."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
2,"This coffee maker makes good coffee. but all the little parts. which don't fit together quite right will make you crazy.  This is a pain to clean.  The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove.  After a few months. I couldn't get it out. even with a pliers.  Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off. when trying to remove the basket.  I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response.  Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good.  In the trash it goes.  The machine also 'beeps' at you a lot....like I need one more complaint!  Good coffee. but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement."
2,"FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder. be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer."
2,"I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range. It does take longer to clean. I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts. I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away. One should use soap vs. just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils. Then if I want a second pot. I either use the other set of parts or if both sets are wet. I dry the pieces with a couple of papertowels. This probably takes 2-4 minutes. I think it's worth the time."
2,"The idea of a machine that ground &amp; brewed coffee was too good to resist. and for a while it was fine (althought it's noise scared the heck out of my dog);  within the first year the heating element croaked.  Sent it back &amp; got a replacement unit. which incidentally only is warranteed for the balance of the first unit's warranty!  6 months later. today. with a full pot of coffee on board. it burst into flame!  Whoa! Fortunately my husband was in the kitchen and took care of it before the house went up. I'm going back to Braun. no question!!"
2,"Worked great for the first year we had it. when we used it maybe 3-4 times.But after that. it seemed like nothing would ever really freeze up enough. I looked into the problem and decided that I might have damaged the cooling capability of the bowl by cleaning it with hot water (which is a no-no).So. I bought a replacement bowl. and once again. for the first year with a few uses it seemed to be OK.But now once again. it's just not getting cold enough - and this time I *know* it's not my fault since I have been very careful to only wash the bowl in cold water."
2,"I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot. Although it is super easy to use. it is not really a practical gadget for regular use. The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance. The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath. Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors. dieters. or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar). I usually make mango ice cream in it. In addition to ice-cream. it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks. In  that case you will want to get an extra canister."
2,"I really wanted to love this ice cream maker.  I was Somersizing and wanted to use the all natural ice cream mixes that went along with the diet.  I could get my ice cream to freeze- that wasn't a problem. It was like wonderful soft serve in the middle of the bowl.  However. all along the edges of the bowl it was frozen rock solid and NOTHING was going to remove the ice cream from around it.  The ring of rock hard ice cream wasn't just a small skim. it was a substantial amount.  Sadly. this has spent more time hidden in the depths of my cabinets than being used."
2,"My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago. My husband and I are vegan. so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes. (I eventually started compiling them in my blog. A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.)We've never had a problem with the machine. Every recipe I've invented has frozen nicely. I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time. so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe. because it can be a pain to clean. especially when I'm using a high-fat coconut milk. Still. it's not too difficult. and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it."
2,"Once I got the hang of it (there is a bit of a learning curve. but it's not terribly steep). I loved the frozen treats that I could make - especially frozen yogurt.A few weeks ago. while it was mid way thru churning. the upper. cylindrical part of the dasher snapped away from the vertical. scraping arm.  Because the machine is out of warranty. I had to order the part's replacement at my own expense.  While it's not going to break the bank. Cuisinart informed me that it would take 8 weeks (!) to fill my order.I'd considered ordering the dasher that was introduced in the newer model. since it's supposed to be more efficient. but I wasn't sure that it would fit in the ICE-20.Bottom Line:  Great concept. lousy parts."
2,"This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.  No more messing with salt and ice cubes--this maker has a special bowl that you keep in the freezer that freezes the ingredients (mine is always frozen so whenever I want to make ice cream I can). This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make 'frozen ANYTHING' with this maker.  Did you know that you could make frozen pudding? The ice cream technique that Cuisinart has perfected of a constant scraping of the sides of the bowl assures that your ice cream is super smooth too. Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.  Great machine!  I've had mine for about six years and use it about once a month and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it."
2,"First let me start by saying I was a little skeptical of ice cream makers. The ones we had when we were kids required dry ice and lots of time. neither of which I have.  This is the best though.  The ice cream is so good and really easy.  I've only had this ice cream maker 4 days and I've already made vanilla. chocolate and strawberry ice cream and peach frozen yogurt and each one is delicious.  It makes the perfect amount for a family. not too much so you're sick of it before it's gone or too little.  And it's so easy.  Basically you just pour the ingredients in while it's mixing and in 30 minutes you have ice cream."
2,"I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock. and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all. but I've really been craving sorbet. and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix. but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours. only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up."
2,"I have had an old Donvier manual model for 30 years. so I'm used to using a chiller bowl.  However. there's no comparison between hand turning the paddle in the Donvier model and letting the Cuisinart do it's thing. I love the fact that the chiller turns and the paddle is stationary.I leave the chiller in the freezer for 1-2 days and make sure my ice cream bases are nice and cold as well.  My ice cream is ready in about 12-13 minutes.  So easy. creamy. fast and smooth. Love. love. love this Cuisinart.I debated on whether to get the 2 qt model or the 1 1/2. My old Donvier makes 2 qts. I opted for the 1 1/2 qt and find that's plenty of ice cream.  Thinking about buying a 2nd chiller for times when I do want to make more than 1 1/2 qts or when I want to make 2 different types of ice cream on the same day.So glad I bought this!Farewell Donvier!"
2,"I had never in my life had homemade ice cream until now. my husband and I bought this as a Christmas present to the both of us. we have everything else you can think of but never an ice cream maker. well we are so impressed with the ice cream we can't wait to try other types. It is without a doubt the best tasting ice cream I have ever had. and this machine makes it so easy to make. just pour in the ingredients and turn it on. set a timer and you can relax. when it is done transfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and let it harden and you have the best tasting ice cream ever! Try it. you will love it!"
2,"I had used an old ice cream maker for years. but got tired of the ice and salt mess. so was using the maker less and less. Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews. I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok. especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well. let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold. it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency. but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!"
2,"We've had this Cuisinart ice cream maker for several months now and have made many different flavors of ice cream.  Without exception the product has been excellent.  I've read some earlier reviews where the reviewer had a problem with the ice cream being too soft.  We have neve experienced this problem.  When it is initially finished it is not as hard as when purchased in a store.  However. merely by placing in the freezer. where ice cream belongs in the first place. it hardens to regular consistency.  Perhaps the reason is that we use the Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream book (available from Amazon).I could not expect or experience a better product for making any kind of ice cream."
2,"I make Raw Cream Ice Cream twice a week.  It works great.  It makes 6 cups.  I need 2 for parties.  Don't over fill and run till it's hard and it's firmer than soft serve.I get 5 cups of cream per gallon of Raw Milk. straight from the mamma cow.  I add 6 Raw Free-Range Egg Yokes. a 1/4 cup of Maple Syrup. 2 1/2 tablespoons of Vanilla Extract and 1 tablespoon of Psyllium Husks.  It's so healthy.  I consider it medicine for my 3 year boy.I find that it does stick to the bowl some.  It's not a problem unless you put it back in the freezer with ice cream in it.  I only do that when I'm leaving soon after making ice cream.  It's not totally quiet. but what do you expect from a motor.  It's quieter than the old salt and ice type."
2,"I received this for my bridal shower.  I tried it to make sure it worked before I lost the gift receipt.  It is so easy to use.  I made up a batch of ingredients to make vanilla frozen yogurt.  It was quick and easy to assemble.  I poured the liquid in and off it went for 20-25 minutes.  It was louder then I anticipated. but nothing crazy.  It froze perfectly and tasted wonderful.  I am looking forward to making more delicious ice creams. sorbets. sherbets. frozen yogurts. and even frozen slushy drinks.  This thing is awesome.  It seems pretty darn solid and it easy to clean."
2,"I bought this for me last summer. and I loved it so much. I bought another as a gift.  It's easy. taste so much better than anything you can buy. and it's fun to be creative.  We never have left over icecream sitting in the freezer now. and when we want some. I keep cream handy in the fridge. so we just toss the ingredients into a blender. pour it into the already frozen bowl. and 'Voila' 30 minutes later we have icecream !!!  Fastest dessert I've ever made. and always a big hit.  Great way to use up ripe bananas. and make banana split ice cream."
2,"I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice cream maker and would highly recommend it to anyone. I have made countless different recipes in it. and this machine makes creamy ice cream in mere minutes. I have also partly frozen the ice cream and then layered a combination of flavors creating a stunning semifredo dessert. When you can get Cuisinart quality at such a reasonable price. why pay more? The only problem I had was that the ice cream was so good I wanted to make more shortly after and the freezer bowl had not completely frozen again. An additional freezer bowl is on my Christmas wish list this year!"
2,"I bought this because I love ice cream and can't have many of the 'preservatives' in store brands and I can't afford the price of high end natural ice creams. Thinking worse case scenario the grandkids would love it I made my first batch of ice cream using fat free half and half. it was amazing!As for the noise it makes. I discovered that setting it on a folded towel on the counter cuts down on the noise alot. My husbands plan is setting it up in the laundry room. closing the door and setting a time. lol that works too.I usually only have to place container in the frezer for 6 hours before using it so I think freezing time depends on type of freezer and settings.What I like teh most is how easy it is to make ice cream and the clean up is also fast and easy.I'm getting each of my adult children one for Christmas gifts this year."
2,"Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [...]and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it. my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one. so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced"
2,"i gave this to my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it. once you put all the stuff in the bowl it only takes 15 minutes. though it should be noted that it then needs a few hours in the freezer to freeze up fully and that many recipes require a little prior prepping. i still think this is the easiest one you will find and it's a big plus to not need ice or salt. very easy to clean and there is an opening at the top so you can watch it work. very cool."
2,"Awesome product... just make sure that your freezer bowl is frozen solid... leave it in your freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 days between ice cream batches just to be sure.  Also. you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine.  My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been.  Other than that. its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream.  If you really like ice cream or have a large family. you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl.  The ice cream will go fast!"
2,"I received this item for Christmas.  I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives.  I used a simple recipe from off the web: Some whole milk. condesed milk. and cocoa powder.  At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours.  It didn't swish when I shook it. so I thought I was good to go.  After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants.  I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning.  After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had.  I will never buy ice cream from the store again.  This ice cream maker is awesome. I love it."
2,"We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make 'Ice Cream' with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.  We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry 'ice cream' using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first."
2,"Highly recommended! I LOVE this ice cream maker. It's so easy and the results are amazing. I like GOOD ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs)and this machine creates stellar ice cream. It rivals any of the best ice cream you can find. Even the basic recipes produce excellent ice cream. I've made mint chip. premium vanilla bean and strawberry. I do recommend using quality dairy products for best results (I use Organic Valley milk and heavy cream). Sorry. Haagen-Dazs. I won't be buying any more ice cream from you!"
2,"This is a very simple machine that does what it's supposed to with very little fuss.  I put the frozen bowl part in our upright freezer at least a few hours before I expect to make ice cream.  I make the custard for the ice cream at the same time.  After dinner. I put the frozen part on the stand. put in the mixing blade and top with the lid.  Then I pour the custard in and 20-30 minutes later we enjoy fresh ice cream with no additives.  If you want ice cream that is harder than soft serve. it will need to 'ripen' a bit more in your freezer.  But this is a delightful machine that I highly recommend.  I never made ice cream before it. and never want to buy it from a grocery again."
2,"This product is getting great reviews for good reason. Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way. First. freeze the bowl overnight. Second. chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled. Use pure vanilla. not imitation vanilla extract. In doing both of these things. I've found I've been able to create soft serve ice cream. which I then freeze for a couple of hours for a hard serve. In not doing these things. I've found that I create milkshakes. and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants. To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie. Amazingly. the recipes in the instruction manual show sorbet and frozen yogurt are on par calorically with homemade ice cream at about 215 calories per 1/2 cup serving. Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly. and I'll experiment with those recipes."
2,"This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours. I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours. At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture. Obviously it was not frozen enough. At 12 hours. I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen. This may not be an issue for everyone. but with our freezer and our bowl it takes a good 20 to 24 hours of the bowl being in the freezer to get the icecream just right."
2,"I actually have the red model with 2 freezer inserts.  It's a very simple machine with only 4 parts and is easy to clean.  The only thing you have to remember is to keep the freezer inserts in the freezer and that the ice cream will be soft when finished churning.  I put my finished ice cream in containers in the freezer and they're ready to eat in a couple of hours.  I wasn't all that happy with the recipes I found in the booklet (didn't want to use heavy cream or cook the base) but there are skazillions of recipes on line and after some trial and error I made up my own.  I saw some people complained of the noise. but it's not all that loud and it only churns for 30 minutes.  Here's the link to my ice cream recipe (makes 2 inserts worth of ice cream) if you're interested.  [...]  I am very happy with this purchase."
2,"I bought this ice cream maker after I took an Ice Cream. Gelato and Sorbet class at Sur La Table cooking store.  Because we were making so many different types of desserts. we had several ice cream makers working in the classroom at the same time.  This ice cream maker was by far my favorite that day and I bought it about a week later.I liked the ease of adding ingredients through the opening on the top and the size is perfect for me.I have used my new ice cream maker with no problems.  The bowl froze easily (probably in less than 24 hours) in the bottom and back of the freezer.  Within about 20 minutes. I had wonderfully frozen ice cream.I certainly plan on getting more adventurous with my ingredients and do not anticipate any problems with this wonderful machine."
2,"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also. I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender. pour it into the frozen bowl. turn it on. & 25 minutes later. you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night."
2,"I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go. I really like how fast it makes ice cream. I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out. Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl. So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream. The texture is just right when its finished. I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer. So I put it into individual portions and that way I don't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy"
2,"I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use. makes great ice cream. and the design is simple. so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price. and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content. you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this. I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use. easy to clean. simple design. great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space"
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
2,"Without a doubt. this is a great appliance!  Mine was a gift. but Amazon's price is the best (as is the service).  It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer.  Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid.  Perhaps their freezers need adjusting?  In fact. after making ice cream (about 20 minutes) my bowl is still mostly frozen.Recipes do not seem to be as important as when baking. so don't be afraid to try something innovative.  Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it. then improvise.We are healthy eaters.  It's nice to know the ingredients I'm using are healthy.  It's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun!"
2,"I and my family have had a blast with this ice cream maker! We have been making up some of our own recipes as well as using those supplied with the machine and some from Ben & Jerry's recipe book. The savings over store bought ice cream is phenomenal too. I only have one small exception to our 'eye blasting red' ice cream maker (and it is indeed a small exception). It could be perhaps be a bit quieter... On the other hand. it is readily apparent by the change in the 'noise' the machine makes. that your delectable treat is ready to decant!GET IT. MAKE IT. LOVE IT...  then do it again!"
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"I just received this yesterday. and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt.  I was a little apprehensive. since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.  My first batch worked flawlessly!  The machine was quiet. operated smoothly. and it was soooo simple!  I am going to buy an extra freezing cannister so we can do two batches back-to-back.  We've been using our old electric rock salt machine. but now we'll probably get rid of it.  Also. due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker. we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.  I recommend it."
2,"Can I say more?  Well. this neat little ice cream maker doesn't take up much space on the counter when in use &amp; stores easily -- the base is no wider in diameter than a dinner plate.  The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid. After having it in the freezer overnight. when it's thoroughly frozen. you put it on the base. fill it with the ingredients for whatever flavor of ice cream you desire. put the mixing blade in and the top on then flip the switch. About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple. You can cover the original container and slip it in the freezer for later. or you can dish it out and wash and refreeze the container -- it is very easy to clean. Also. by the way. it's the best ice cream you'll ever have. Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry."
2,"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar. but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said. you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir. and then take the freezer bowl out. cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great. I have very little problem with ice crystals forming."
2,"I've had my Cuisinart ice cream maker for 5 years now and am still delighted with it!  I even bought an extra freezer bowl in case I want to make 2 flavors the same day.  I do make sure to stop the freezer after 20-25 minutes of operation or the ice cream will start to soften.  And I learned early on to chill the ingredients OVERNIGHT or the ice cream won't freeze - just gets thick.  But it's a great item. and doesn't take up much space on the counter. I'm especially happy with it since I can't eat regular ice cream because of lactose intolerance.  So I use liquid nondairy creamer to make ice cream in this freezer and it's very satisfactory!"
2,"... is home-made ice cream. I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit. No mess. quick. easy. home made ice cream. Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted. Great for frozen drinks. too. including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction. powerful motor. It's noisy but not too much.The ice cream from this (or any) ice cream maker comes out soft serve. but it's really true. if you put the ice cream in the freezer for another 1-2 hours. it hardens to the exact same consistency as store-bought ice cream. It's surprising the first time you try this. because you think it'll come out solid like a block of ice. but it doesn't - it's soft but scoopable."
2,"I ordered the Cuisinart Ice Cream maker after reading all of the reviews on Amazon and it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  To be honest. I thought that making home-made ice cream would be just too  difficult. but with the Cuisinart. I've made it three times in the past  week.  You simple mix-up the ingredients. chill. and then pour into the  pre-frozen bowl.  Perfect every time.  I highly recommend the book.  &quot;Gelato! : Italian Ice Cream. Sorbetti &amp; Granite&quot; by Pamela  Sheldon Johns as a great add-on.  I ordered the book with the hope of being  able to duplicate the Stracciatella(?) Gelato I had while on vacation in  Italy.  The recipe was simple (heavy cream. milk. sugar. vanilla. and  shaved chocolate) and the results were fabulous.This machine would  make a great gift as well!"
2,"Soft serve at best is what this unit does. I followed the instructions to the letter. The freezer container was kept at 0 degrees for &#62;24 hours. The mix was kept in the frid for 6 hours to hopefully assist in keeping things cold. The unit works well and within 15 minutes I had a nice batch of soft serve. However all the unit does is save you the trouble of mixing the batch by hand. I think Ice Cream means it shouldn't flow out of the container until it melts. This it pour-able into a dish. On a hot day of say 85 degrees. this wouldn't last long enough to lick a cone of it before it was running down your arm. I can deal with hand mixing from now on and placing the batch in the freezer and waiting."
2,"This was a good purchase and the recipe book is great! I've made half of them now; some were awesome. some good. some didn't work. The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so. which I found strange. An ice cream maker shouldn't get hot! The ice cream is still really yummy. but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks. Overall. for $60. it does the job and there haven't been any major problems!"
2,"I ordered this RED ice cream maker to give to my husband's daughter and family for Christmas along with a RED quesadilla maker.  I ordered the Cuisinart because a friend has the stainless one and really brags about it - makes ice cream 2 or 3 times a week - says it is EASY and GOOD!  I just know that they will have a great family time together making ice cream with the RED ice cream maker and the color couldn't be any better for a Christmas gift!  And - yes - I shop early so there's not such a rush around Christmas time!"
2,"LOVE this ice cream maker.  I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are. Doesn't take up much room. It's the perfect size for my husband and me.  Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.  IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things. like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.  I admit I wasn't sure it would work the first time. it seemed too easy. but sure enough in 25 minutes we were in ice cream heaven.  We like to transfer the ice cream to a tupperware container and stick it in the freezer for an hour or so before eating so it's firmer. but if we can't wait....  I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.  We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something."
2,"Yes. upfront I'll say it's a little noisy. but that kind of goes with the territory.  Works perfectly. just as described in the directions.  I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.  It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.  Makes great ice cream. ice milk. bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.  Once you do that you may never make it any other way.  Once you price the ingredients. I cannot honestly say making ice cream is all that much cheaper than buying it. but the quality is far superior to store bought. and you have the added bonus of knowing exactly what is in your ice cream."
2,"I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far.  3 were from the manual that came with the machine. and one was from the internet.  All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture.  The ice cream was not creamy and melty. it was either icy or fudgy.  I like the machine. it is easy to use. but also quite loud.  We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned.  I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people don't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well.  The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream. but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it."
2,"This Product turned out to be what I expected based on other's reviews.but it does what it says if you follow the directions carefully.The only thing is that it does not get the ice cream to a solid texture.like soft serve as other's have said.so you can freeze it more within a few hours if preferred as I did.It is slightly noisy but it does not bother me.sound can be compared to a blow dryer on low perhaps but not exact.Other than that minor issue it works pretty good and I intend to use it plenty.also I was glad to purchase it in my favorite color red."
2,"Makes ice cream! I am on a no carb diet.. but I didn't want to give up my favorite frozen treat. This makes ice cream.. takes maybe 20 minutes.. the ice cream holder itself requires about 24hrs to freeze prior to use. You can of course use it before 24 hours.. but its more like a milkshake.. which is also fine  :)I have never used an ice cream maker before this one. My boyfriend has a self refrigerating one.. he said this one is A LOT quieter.I love it."
2,"Will never buy ice cream again!!  At first was hesitant bytthe few negative reviews.  Bought one two days ago and bought a load of milk and supplies cause figured it would take 5 or 6 times to get it right.  have made 4 ice creams already.  So far they have all turned out GREAT!  have always loved soft serve better.  used mostly the recipes that came with the machine except that being lactose intolerant. i used lactaid milk and also used baking splenda instead of sugar.  It worked out fine. But. i did make sure all the ingredients were real cold before i put them into the machine.  and also i put the 2 bowls into the chest freezer in plastic bags.  We are real happy with this for sure."
2,"We were initially disappointed with this machine.  We tried recipes out of the booklet that came with it. the Ben & Jerry's book and another source.  The ice cream was just OK.  Something along the line of what we could pick up at the local convenience store.  Then we tried the recipe out of Christopher Kimball's The Desert Bible.  Hallelujah!  Creamy. rich. just what we had hoped for.We had a similar experience with our bread machine.  Mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook.  So. don't blame the machine too quickly.  The fault may lie in the recipe book."
2,"I bought this because my son was diagnosed with a dairy allergy.  I wanted to be able to provide ice cream without breaking the bank.  There are new coconut milk ice creams available but at $6 a pint I could pay for this unit in a hurry.  I buy my Thai brand Coconut Milk (not lite) from Walmart at $1.42 per can.  You just freeze the cylander. add 2 cans of coconut milk. a little sugar. vanilla and whatever else you want to flavor and let it go.  1/2 hour later I had what looked like soft serve ice cream.  My children were so thrilled!"
2,"If you think that you cannot make good ice cream without the rock salt and a ton of ice. well you should check out this Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker!  It is so easy and convenient to use. and in 20-25 minutes you have soft serve ice cream.  If you want to freeze it hard. just put it in the freezer for awhile if there is any left after you taste your results over and over again!  Also. if you make a lot of ice cream. be sure to pick up the extra freezer container.  Keep one in the freezer at all times and you are never caught without one that is ready to go!"
2,"I've only used this once so far. but it's pretty awesome.  You just pour in your pre-mixed. chilled ingredients. press start. and set a kitchen timer.  20-30 minutes later. the ice cream comes out like soft serve. which is great. but you can pour it into a freezer container and firm it up if you'd like. (which I did because it was for a birthday party later in the day).  My only complaint is that it's a little noisy.  I wouldn't recommend running it while you're trying to watch a movie or something.  I'm looking forward to using this more when the weather warms up here in Michigan."
2,"This is very easy to use; it's just like another small appliance you can use on your counter top.  It does a good job. except that a hard frozen layer forms around the sides and needs to be scraped down about halfway through.I'm updating this since I've had it a few more months.  It still works great. and I've been able to experiment more.  Even if I don't get the recipie just right. it freezes just fine.  I use frozen berries to make sorbets with less sugar (high fructose corn syrup) than the grocery store kinds.  I've also made a batch of very rich vanilla (with eggs carefully cooked) and it came out wonderful."
2,"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list. and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was 'awesome.' I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise. but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet. but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender."
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
2,"This is my second summer using the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker. and it's never let me down.  Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite.  As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home. when the ice cream is done. it will . . . still be soft. but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable.  Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer.'  My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy. but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch--not too long to vacate the kitchen."
2,"I love this machine.  A cousin had tried a couple of other brands including one about 4 times more expensive and had to return both of them. so I read the reviews very carefully.  This one is easy to use and it works.  I followed the instructions exactly. The ice cream is great.  I did freeze the ice cream for an additional 2 hours after it was mixed as the manual suggests.  Works perfectly. Yumm  It doesn't make a lot. just a little over two pints."
2,"This machine is very easy to use.  It comes with a handy little recipe book to help you with your first few recipes.  One thing you must do is  freeze the bowl for a good 24 hours the first time. then you will want to  cover the bowl in plastic (to prevent freezer flavors tainting the bowl).  and leave it in your freezer.  You will be making home made ice cream in  about 20 minutes.  The consistancy is good. and it is delicous.  Best of  all. you will not be adding any strange presevatives. or anything you do  not want.  Ben and Jerry's has an excellent recipe book that you can get  here at amazon. and you will be making up tasty ice cream in no time!"
2,"I got one of these ice cream makers as a Christmas gift. and it's been fantastic. I was careful before requesting it to check the temperature of my freezer. If your freezer doesn't maintain a temperature of between 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit. your ice cream probably won't turn out that well. Mine stays at a chilly zero degrees. and I've been amazed at how quickly this machine makes great frozen desserts. I've made the full-fat ice creams. a couple of sherbets. and frozen yogurt -- everything froze quickly and evenly. and came out with fantastic texture and flavor. It's been a great gift. I keep the bowl in the freezer. wrapped in a plastic bag and filled with frozen vegetables. so it's always ready to go."
2,"I bought this for my son for his birthday.  Wow. is it easy and delicious.  A person could be in real trouble with this ice cream maker sitting around.We first made the vanilla recipe and it was better than wonderful...just a few ingredients into the bowl and away you go.  Fat City is on the horizon.  I love it.  Thank goodness my son lives 1000 miles away or I would be in real trouble with this little machine.  The price is good and the ice cream is wonderful.  Wonderful gift."
2,"I just got this machine and made the strawberry ice cream recipe that came with it.  Ben and Jerry. eat your heart out.  This is so easy there's no reason to ever eat store bought ice cream again.  No locust bean gum. no artificial color. no preservatives - and you can make it with organic ingredients if you want.  The ice cream tastes awesome. and I would recommend this machine to anyone. especially those who cannot use a hand crank machine. or don't want the fuss and muss of using salt."
2,"I read many of the reviews before buying this ice cream maker. and the reviewers were right!  It's a great little machine...I don't think it's that noisy (no more so than a food processor).  I love it - I do agree that the recipes that come with it are not great. but there are lots of wonderful recipes out there.  This is fast. easy. and no worries about salt and ice running all over make it much more likely I will continue to use it quite often!"
2,"I have always used my kitchen aid attachment for ice cream and am very happy with it; however. we don't eat a lot of ice cream and the Kitchen Aid bowl was too big.  I picked this up when I read some great reviews and I am very pleased.  The ice cream maker is very easy to use and while not as quiet as I hoped for. it doesn't take long to get great ice cream.  Note that what you first end up with is more soft serve which we really enjoy but after a few hours in the freezer you have more of an ice cream texture.  Great product - Cuisinart never lets me down!"
2,"I've just gotten this machine and have made the basic vanilla ice cream twice. Both times were a total sucess!  The ice cream is delicious!  No more ice and salt mess! Preparation time is quick and easy! The machine is a little noisy. however. no big deal. It was facinating watching it thicken up for the final result. Time in the freezer is usually needed after it's done.  That's the hardest part....the waiting!  Clean up time is quick as well! Looking forward to trying the other recipes in the booklet. I'm sure they'll be just as tasty.  I highly recommend this machine!!  I know that we'll be having home made ice cream a lot more often now!"
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
2,"I connected some quick disconnect fittings to this Y fitting. Two of the openings in this Y were the right size. but one opening was too large. I had to cut slots in the rim of the opening and use a hose clamp to bring the size down to the correct diameter. I verified the opening diameter with several other fittings and calipers to see that the one opening was indeed bigger than the normal size.This item will normally work great if you are connecting hose directly to it. but use caution when connecting other items to it.Plastic will change shape after it has been injected and cools (like this product). Good engineering and good chemical composition will compensate for those changes. I recommend getting a different brand product instead of this one if you want quality and consistency."
2,"I use the TN311C heavy-duty grounded timer to control the ON-OFF cycle of a dehumidifier.  I actually bought two units - the 2nd one as a back-up - and. removed all of the 'ON' and 'OFF' trippers from the back-up unit to use on this one.  This gives me 6 ON-OFF cycles. and it works perfectly with our dehumidifier.  I've set the timer to turn ON the dehumidifier for 2 hours and then OFF for 2 hours throughout the day and night.  It keeps our area perfectly dehumidified. and the humidity rise is only 4% to 5% during the OFF cycle.I would recommend this timer to anyone considering a use similar to mine."
2,"I have used a number of these for years with no problems whatsoever.  However I realized that the timers use more power than some of my lights!  I have a 4 Watt night light which we run all night in the hallway and the timer draws 5 Watts - 24x7.  That was bad enough. but then I replaced the 4 Watt night light with an LED bulb that draws 1/2 watt or so.  It was way cheaper to run that 24x7 then to use a timer to 'save money' and have it only on at night.  I have thrown these all away and purchased digital timers - they pay for themselves in energy savings."
2,"I've bought 2 of these exact same ones. one is still working & the other one went bad after3 or 4 years so that seemed reasonable.This one i just got yesterday from amazon doesn't work. The dial turns but it gets stuckat the pins. I noticed another reviewer had the same problem so I'm here to buy another brand.UPDATE: After i wrote the above I took the unit and kept spinning the dial to loosen it up.I plugged it back in & found it WOULD now turn on but not OFF. So i repeated spinning the dial over & over & finally. now it's working properly."
2,"I'd had these timers for years and had no problems. so the issue is not with the timer itself. BUT now that I have a TODDLER. these really can't be used anymore. since she finds it fun to pull out the little plastic pieces that are needed to set the timer. Not only is this a choking hazard (however minor). but once the pieces are gone. the timer is useless! CAUTION WITH DIGITAL TIMERS. TOO. THOUGH (though I'll have to try them again): We had a power surge. and all of the timers got ruined (and we tried to change the batteries - no help)! SO. OVERALL A GOOD PRODUCT AND MORE RELIABLE THAN DIGITAL TIMERS. but NOT good if you have toddlers!"
2,"This is a nice window fan with good power and not too noisy. adaptable to different window sizes if you need to move it. However. the sliding panels are flimsy and don't move smoothly; the fasteners that are used to clamp the panels in place are cheap and can easily be unscrewed and fall out.  The single knob control works fine but the settings are hard to see; you will end up turning it by click or fan noise to the desired power or direction. Well-packaged in the box."
2,"This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues. but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy. but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws. so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you. put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable. but it exhausts air much better than it draws air. and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed. which is how we run it anyway."
2,"I have a Lasko fan that I bought around 1989 which still runs and I live in an apartment on the second floor that gets very hot in the summer so I decided to get another fan to have cross ventilation. I am really pleased with my purchase. this fan is lighter and easier to place in the window and you don't need to screw it in the window for it to stay in. It is much quieter than the older fan even on high speed and doesn't shake in the window like the older model does.I like the fan so much that I plan on purchasing another one next month and give the older model to a friend."
2,"We raise & show rabbits so we bought this fan for our rabbit barn because the ammonia smell was getting really bad in there & we needed something to pull that smell out. The barn isn't real big so there's wasn't enough air flow in there with only 1 window & 1 door so... needless to say we are VERY pleased with this exhaust fan!!! We keep the fan on exhuast 24/7 & you would never know that rabbits lived in there! It gets the smell out seconds after turning it on. I love that you can put it in the window & still be able to close the window behind it during bad weather. I was surprised at how inexpensive this fan was too! Definitely worth buying! & If something were to happen to the one we have we will definitely be buying another one!"
2,"I searched for an exhaust fan for our new. hot garage.  I did not believe some of the negative reviews and neither should you!  This fan fit right into our garage window and has been working every day for months!  Who cares if it is not made out of a heavy metal; you don't have to touch it except to turn it off and on.  It pulls and exhausts a lot of air and that is what it is supposed to do.  Don't make life more complicated then it has to be.  With all my searching. Amazon gave me the best deal and with my rewards from my Amazon credit card the fan cost me $54.  What's not to like when other stores wanted as much as $110?"
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
2,"This fan is a good fan but does not move the amount of air I want to move.  I usually put a fan at one end of the house then open my bedroom window and have the fan pull in cool air at night.  this somewhat does the  job but really not enough.  I might be asking for too much for its size etc.  I like the fact that it is reversable and it is adjustable to fit wide or narrow windows.  If you are using it for one room this is a good fan but not great for the whole house (I have a small house 1500 sq ft).  I'd give it a try and see if it works for you."
2,"These are great fans--I bought one for the upstairs hall. and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home.  WIth both of them running on exhaust. the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night.  There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though.  I had no choice but to mount the fan on  the inner window frame for both windows. because the extensions do not reach far enough to mount on the outside of the window frame.  The windows cannot be shut with the fan mounted. because they have a 'lip' at the bottom. that overhangs a bit and runs the length of the window. to make opening and closing easier.  The lip interferes with the window closing while the fan is in place. so the fan must be removed from the mount if heavy rain is expected (Hurricane Irene. for instance!)  Even so. the fan is easily removed. once the screws are in place."
2,"Probably the best available today. but. certainly not like the old metal ones. It fits where and how I want it to go and will do the job.It's got some sharp plastic edges on the inside. Sliced a finger reaching in to slide the side panels to fit.Low and medium speeds don't move much air and the small motor whines a bit on high. Fortunately I don't have to be in the room with it when it's on high.It does a much better job than the Holmes dual window fan I was using but I do long for the old metal King Air 20' I had years ago. That was a window fan."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
2,"There are too many reviews already to fret over one detail or another. so here's my brief take: my fan is well balanced. no perceptible wobbling or shaking at any speed.  The blades spin freely suggesting little bearing drag to strain the motor.  I found that it easily fits several of my windows without actually mounting it (i.e.. installing the four screws that come with it).  That's a plus for me because I may want to use it in different rooms at different times - I can just set it in a window when needed. then remove it when I want it elsewhere or not at all.  My wattage meter says it uses about 63W on low and 78W on medium (very quiet at both low and medium speeds) and about 110W on high (noticeably louder than low/medium but not at all intrusive or annoying in my view).  If my house were bigger I'd buy another.  Good stuff."
2,"I'm so happy we have this fan!!!1. We turn it on &#34;reverse&#34; in the evening. drawing the cool air into our hot bedroom and it cools down the room a solid 10 degrees almost immediately.2. We leave it on all night in the reverse setting and it's completely changed our sleep pattern for the better. It keeps our room cool and drones out the loud road noise.3. I love having the option of having the window open still with the fan off and a soft breeze.4. The unit is not very attractive so we have a cafe curtain in front of it. When we turn it on. the curtain just blows upward and is not in the way.5. Install it on a window with a screen. We originally tried a different room. an old double hung window with no screen. and we woke up to a flying insect massacre on the floor. They were sucked in and didn't have a chance."
2,"Having a small kitchen and not a great exhaust. solutions like fan windows are great. but all too often they are small and have to sit below the window. That means that when it rains or cold out. you have to remove the fan to close the window. This fan stays in the window year round but allows you to open and close the window without having to remove the fan!  Not only that. it's very powerful and VERY quiet.  Cooking smells are eliminated very fast with the three speed reversible motor. I even let my smoking friends sit at the table when they light up because not a particle of smoke enters the house with this fan running.It's a great solution for us and I'm on my second year of using it."
2,"I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up."
2,"...for a fan that could pull air thru the whole house. but did not want to pay $200 for one.  This seems to have done the job.  I used it this past hot summer (2012) as an exhaust fan to move air in the house and to get it cooled off in the evening.  This machine seems to have done it. quietly...quieter that I thought it would be.  It is a two-directional fan. so you can bring air in or pull it out.  It also has 3 speeds. I used the medium speed all summer. 24/7.  No problems to report. would buy another.  I don't have AC here so this was it. and it stood the test. Recommended..."
2,"Really. this is close to an ideal fan if you want a window fan. The biggest issue is the way the fan mounts to the window frame. When you do it correctly it is secure. but not tight. There is just enough play in the way it mounts (drops down on screws) that there is a rattle when the fan is on. This was dealt with easily enough with some foam tape. but the tape needs occasional fixes.The ability to close the window while the fan is on. and reverse the airflow is great. For our apartment (1200sf) this fan can make a noticeable difference in temperature and air quality in about 5-10 minutes depending on the fanspeed. This is way more effective than sitting a box fan at the window because the airflow HAS to go through the window instead of cycling back into the fan."
2,"I needed a good window fan to keep the air moving in my country cottage. I am able to limit the use of A/C if I have a means for proper ventilation. This fan satisfies that need.It was fairly easy to install but still required a bit of ingenuity as the side panels were a bit of a challenge. They will slide but be patient because they will also break if forced.  The fan is very quiet. emitting a hum rather than a roar when running at full speed.I will leave the fan in the window for the entire season so I will not have to struggle with the side panels again until it is time to remove it."
2,"I installed this on a horizantaly sliding window.  It probably took about 10 to 20 minutes to install.  Its just 4 screws. It comes with a guide for the position of the screws which helped. It works awesome. You even have to put a door stop infront of a door in a beadroom if you have the fan in the room blowing the air in. otherwise its strong enough to slam your door shut. We liked it so much so that we bought a second one and installed it in the kitchen to clear the air when we are cooking.  we will usually put the fans on exaust and open up the living room window and it pulls in a strong breese with them both sucking the air thru the house.I can't recommend them enough. we wish we got them years ago!!!  Just make sure you open another window in the house so the air has somewhere to go."
2,"I bought an Air King 20' (same manufacturer of the Lasko) whole house fan a couple of years ago and it proved to be too much fan for my &lt; 2000 sq. ft. condo. I went for this 16' and it does the job just as quietly as the 20'. Very easy to install within the window frame and no vibration. I only wish that the side extenders were metal like they are on the Air King. The grill on the front of the fan is metal. I am very happy with this purchase and that's why it gets FIVE STARS. These are both excellent. high quality fans and I would not hesitate to purchase again."
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
2,"I bought my windmachine after my smaller honeywell fan finally died after a number of years.  In truth. I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night.  To that end. it's been perfect.  It's a powerful fan. so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise.  Note that this is not a small fan.  It's just shy of 2' tall. so while the handle on top makes it portable. and it's built to stand on the floor. it's not made for a tiny bedroom.  The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room. I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool.  I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I'm still very happy with it a year later!  Included 2 images for a visual."
2,"Before I finally installed air conditioning. I used this fan. In fact. I had two of them and used them for several years.This is the most powerful fan I've ever had. It doesn't rattle or clang like metal window fans. It really stirs up the air and cools the room.The three settings - low. medium and high - are achieved by turning a huge and easy to turn knob. You can tilt the fan up or down and than lock it into position using the knobs on the side. By placing one fan upward and another downward you'll get a wonderful and refreshing cross breeze.If you can't afford air conditioning or you live in an area that only needs a fan. you will love the WindMachine. I still use mine to dry clothes that I don't want to place in the drier. I hang them over the shower rod and turn the fans setting to high. The clothes are dry within a couple of hours."
2,"This is the second Wind Machine that I've owned. our first one just stopped working after almost 10 years.  We use ours almost exclusively in our very large master bedroom on the high setting (we like the sound and the breeze).  Others mentioned that it's not all that powerful. but we find it plenty strong for indoor/casual use.  It's not an industrial shop fan by any means. but it's great for cooling a large room. painted walls. even outside on a deck.  It's very light for it's size and the tilting feature is nice."
2,"I don't often rave about a product. but this one deserves it.  This is what I so love about it: 1. Works like a dream. No rattles. shakes. quivers. Just a steady strong stream of wonderful air.  2.Well built.  It arrived in the military pouch system with the box a bit smashed. but not a single dent on the item.  3. It's light.  I can cart it room to room very easily.  Even though it's so light. it sits on the floor very stably.  4. The only sound it makes is the sound of air moving. no whine. no rattles. no vibrations.  5. No assembly required. None! 6. The design is compact. extreme care given to maximizing output for the footprint.  I'm impressed."
2,"This fan really moves the air. To give you an idea how good this fan works. do you know those 20' box fans they sell for 15 or 20 bucks. well this Lasko 3300 fan on low blows as hard as the 20' box fan on high. No kidding. I think this is by far the best fan I've ever owned.Will post a couple pictures for you to get a better look at it. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan. Don't hesitate. buy it."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
2,"This fan will blow you down. Works just as good as the heavy duty silver fans. I sit my fan on top of my radiator or a stand right by the window at night and my room goes from hot to cold in a split second. It brings all that cool night air right into my house. All fans don't do this. Burrrrr I'm getting goose bumps now because I'm freezing. Let me get up and turn it to low now since its extremely cool in here. I have 2 of these. I used to have 3 but the third one disappeared. Maybe someone stole it.  Oh Well . anyway fan is definitely worth the price."
2,"Even on the lowest setting. this thing is definitely a wind machine. While my apartment is central air conditioned. I like to keep the thermostat on 78 to save energy. Having this fan definitely helps things feel cooler and results in less trips to the thermostat to turn down the temperature.When you crank this thing up to high. it's really a force to be reckoned with. My cat is slightly scared of it on higher settings as it does get a little loud and moves quite a bit of air.Added benefit is that if you use this in a bedroom at night. it serves as a pretty decent white noise source as well.Great fan all around. especially for those hot summer days."
2,"I received this cooker for Christmas 2008 ( a Wal Mart purchase).It was my first pressure cooker. and it cooked wonderfully (though it was a bit tight for two chickens); until it failed.After about 6 uses. it would no longer establish pressure.  The red pop up on the handle (indication that pressure was up and handle locked) started popping up to about twice the height it normally emerged from the handle (when the cooker worked) and steam vented from all around the handle junction with the lid.I tried everything the book said to do.  The handle was tight.  I inspected. streched and oiled the gasket. No luck.  I called Mirro (Wearever) and they told me to boil the gasket for 15 min. and then oil it.  I did all these things. to no avail.So I returned it.  Now I'm going to try Presto."
2,"Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run.  A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it.  Never thought I'd own one (grew up with one -- home cooking). so thought I'd try it myself.So you know. bought one at Walmart (has the Wearever brand)-- $40.00. and it comes with a real return policy vs. Amazon's 30 day return policy (make sure you read that before buying anything here...surprising how inflexible they are if you miss it by only a few days. even for long standing customers who have never asked for any special preferences.)"
2,"I bought this only to make apple sauce. Growing up. my mother had one (for 25+ years) that all of us kids would use and this is nothing like the one we used to use. I have used it 6-8 times and have found the following:- I can only fit a very small bowl underneath it.- The legs slide all over the place easily. I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine. but the craftsmanship is very low. VERY thin metal. and I don't expect this to last more than 2 seasons of making apple sauce. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this item."
2,"My 'ricer' - collander - food press arrived just an hour ago. I have fond memories of this 'ricer'. a favorite kitchen implement of my Dad's. I still have an old pestle from the old days.  The design is a little different from the ones of my childhood. but I think this design appeals to me more.  I love 'riced' potatoes and anticipate using this 'food press' to make tomato purees and finish other fruit. I'm just excited to have it."
2,"Back in the day. moms all had pressure cookers and made beef stews and pot roasts in them. These cookers are being rediscovered and are making a big comeback as they're not just for stew any more. Hundreds of new recipes are appearing and Amazon has some really good pressure cooker cookbooks available. We recently bought this Presto 4 qt. size (just for 2 of us) but larger sizes are available. Mom was right. they are FAST. make delicious food and will impress guests. They're not expensive - give this a try. you won't be disappointed."
2,"Other reviewers see the same problem as mine.The lower handle has little to hold it on. The single bolt that came with the pot is too small and won't hold on. We were forced into using a 32 thread 1/4' hex bolt. It held for a year. Now the handle has fallen off. again. Is the bolt the problem? No. it's the threaded receptacle! MAYBE. if I drill out the receiving threaded shank and try to force a 32 thread #10 bolt in.If This doesn't work. I'm avoiding buying another Presto from China.When the pot worked. it did well. A little hard to get the aluminium grooves to hit the slots without a fight.Nope. this cooker is useless. Presto you stink."
2,"There is little good about this Presto 4qt Aluminum pressure cooker.  It...Cannot keep the handle tight. I have to tighten it down about every other use.Cannot form a steam tight seal. steam leaks out around the handles. making them hot to touch. and through the pressure stem indicator that is supposed to seal off...it doesn't.Cannot keep the broth (fluid) inside from spewing out the weighted rocker pressure regulator even though the fluid level is well below the 4 guart level.Has no opposing handle; so picking it up while hot and full is problematic when trying to move the cooker to a faucet to cool it down.In a word. we got what we paid for...the cheapest and worst made pressure cooker on the market."
2,"Our 20+ year old 4 quart Presto pressure cooker has had at least half a dozen gasket replacements. We're pretty old. so I thought it was time to get my 79 year old cook. and lovely wife of 55 years a bright new pot instead of just another gasket.The old one worked well for all these years. and the new one already has a dozen or more cooking cycles on it - and appears to do as well as the one it replaced.BTW: we replaced a 6 quart Presto at the same time and the comment is the same on it."
2,"I was finally convinced that I need a pressure cooker for meat due to my work hours. I looked everywhere for the smallest size. they were either unavailable or too expensive. Reviews here showed great product so I bought it. I used it the very first day and I couldn't be more satisfied. Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes. I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that doesn't affect the cooking. It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook."
2,"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker. purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap. it not only does not do the job. the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker. that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk."
2,"I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault. I didn't realize that this model did not have a quick release. I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault. I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves. I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it. That is why I stuck with the same brand. I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also didn't like how I had to screw the handles into place. I want something that has permanently attached handles. I'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto. I can't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option. If anyone does. please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me."
2,"I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker. hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use. just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean. as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!"
2,"I live at 9500 ft altitude where it can take many hours to tenderize anything. I cook stew meat in 25 to 30 mins. pot roast in 50 mins. veggies in 5 mins after it gets up to temp. Trick is to have only the small recommended amount of water.I've had the 6 qt stainless for 18 years and need to replace the rubber seal and plug every 7 years or so. I use mine a lot. 3 times a week ($7 for both at AMZ) which is why I am here commenting. Don't get the aluminum ones. not good for you.Very safe and fool proof. You can't open it until it stops steaming.Tales about dangerous come from Grandmas who were cooking in the 1930's. 40 and early 50's before safety features.Buy into their recipes not their tales."
2,"This is my second presto pressure cooker in a year. I loved my first one and used it several times a week. but I didn't add enough water once. scorched the heck out of it. and it was never the same. I tried all the thrifty tricks to get out scorched ick but it didn't work. However. I liked and used this one so much I bought another one exactly like my first.I have a Russel Hobbes electric pressure cooker that is larger and really nice for food that cooks longer because I can set it and walk away. However. it's big and bulky. My Presto is my go too pressure cooker for potatoes. makes great cheesecake. I love pressure cooking squash. carrots etc. The construction is heavy and seems well made."
2,"Just received this unit. and I'm very happy with it so far. It is easy to assemble. sturdy. and most importantly has a very simple design which I anticipate will be durable into the future. My previous pressure cooker was a complex affair with springs and components tucked away in plastic housing so that they could not be accessed. This design. on the other hand. is much more simplistic. which is a very good thing. It cost about 1/4 the price of the cheapest PC that I could get in local stores (including postage). and is a preferable design."
2,"Strong words for a pressure cooker. I know. but this thing has been such a disappointment.  I bought it to replace my old 6-Quart Presto pressure cooker that worked well and faithfully for many years.  I'm not sure if they have started making these things in China after I purchased my last pressure cooker or what.  This new one is much lighter weight and the metal feels thin and cheap.  The handle screw continually comes loose which makes the handle itself loose and wobbly.  The pressure hole doesn't seem to line up properly so that I have to use a knife to wiggle the pressure button free to pop up so it can start to cook after the pressure builds.  If you are looking for a solid. reliable pressure cooker - - keep looking!  This is not the one!"
2,"I had never used a pressure cooker before but have been planning to buy one for a while. and decided to buy this one because it looks well made and has good reviews.I tried cooking several vegetables and some Sirloin tips (separately) and found the Sirloin surprisingly tender. the vegetables retained a lot more flavor.I did carefully read the instructions and after one or two uses found it easy to use. I bought a timer to use with it because cooking times seem to be important as does making sure it does not boil dry.This is a great time and energy saver. resulting in great tasting food!"
2,"I have been using Presto Pressure Cookers for the past 35+ years. they are simply the best on the market. and I have had other brands. those other brands ended up at my yard sale. the Presto Pressure Cooker is the best! always reliable. and I have never had to replace the gasket. that is saying something to the quality of the product. which by the was has been on the market for longer than I have been alive. and thats a long long time. so why bother with the rest when you can have the best. and at a great price. give it a try. you will be delighted with all you can make and the time saved cooking this way. especially cheaper cuts of meat.I can't say enough good things about this pressure cooker!"
2,"I had one of these great cookers long ago.  My old one was very heavy.  This one is made of stainless steel and seems to be lighter.  I had to attach the handles. so some assembly on this one is required.  My first recipe was. 'Ham Hocks & Navy Beans'. and I cooked the pre-soaked beans and ham hocks in about 25 or 30 minutes.  They turned out great. but had to guess at the cooking time. as the recipe was not in the enclosed instruction/recipe booklet. but in my head!  Since then. I have purchased two great pressure cooker cookbooks.  I plan to cook many more dishes in this quick-cooking appliance.  Be sure to read THOROUGHLY. the instruction booklet. to safely use this(& all) pressure cookers."
2,"I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130."
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
2,"I have an electric pressure cooker that has a hard anodized interior that is sometimes impossible to clean.  This stainless steel pressure cooker is a breeze to clean.  As soon as it arrived I went to my local hardware store and replaced all of the screws with stainless steel because that seem to be a problem with other users.  I soaked some black beans and after only 4 minutes cooking under pressure. I had a pot of beans.  The 6 quart size is perfect for me since you can't fill it too much.  I just love my new pressure cooker.  Looking forward to many great meals."
2,"We have had a pressure cook for many years.  It was great for camping. for we could make New England Boil Dinner.  My wife has our old one at the shore. and we use it a lot.  However. many of the family are not there but in our villa 100 miles away. and we like many meals that we us the Presto pressure cooker.  Now. I can make the dinners here. and we thing they are the best pressure cookers around.  It is great time saver."
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
2,"This is a really excellent item....but the little rubber safety button (to release pressure if something gets clogged) isn't as good as it could be.  Every now and then. it releases the steam so no pressure can build up.  If I jiggle it. to get it to set. it generally falls down into the kettle.  At that point. I have to remove the lid. and fish the button out of whatever is in there -- easy if it's broccoli. but more of a problem if it's bean soup.  I realize that this is my fault for not checking it each time. but with my old one (not nearly as good. overall) I never had to think about it.  Remember. this is a GREAT pressure cooker -- I'm just kvetching."
2,"I always avoided pressure cookers until a little over a year ago. I purchased the Presto 6-quart electric version. I love it. but it is annoying to have to drag it out when I wanted to use it. I saw this smaller size stove-top variety and hoped it would be as good as the electric. It's better!  I never put it away because it has become my go-to pan whether or not I'm using the pressure cooking feature. It's a good weight. great heat distribution. NOT aluminium. and sturdy. As a pressure cooker. I find that I can turn the heat on my stove to between 2 and 3 and it works beautifully. From using the other pressure cooker once or twice a month. I find I use this one three-four times a week. Minor issue - yes - the screws do rust. One of these days. I'll take one to Home Depot so I can get a non-rusting version."
2,"my mother used her pressure cooker to feed 5 kids on a regular basis. and the stories of her mother's old ring-style pressure cooker. well... just hilarious.  I have no such entertaining stories. just dozens of great meals cooked quickly and well in a cooker that goes directly into the dishwasher. no fuss. no muss.  Learn how to use one and you will never live without one.  This one is quite good because if the cooker isn't stainless steel. putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white.  And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood."
2,"I've used a Premium grade. Innova 8 Qt. for years. It is way too big for every day. single person use. The Presto works decently. but not well built. The handles are fastened by only one screw. The lid closing stop. catches past the point it should be. The lid pressure open-lock safety takes effort to seat when heating up.The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in. Dia. Without the lid. the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in. height. the 6 Qt is only 2 in. taller making it the better option. A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.Induction compatible??? A magnet sticks to the bottom and top. but not the sides."
2,"I replaced my old Aluminium Pressure cooker (4 Litre) from India with this wonderful stainless steel pressure cooker. The quality is great and the price is fantastic. The pressure cooker from India blew a whistle by itself to let out the pressure and 4-5 whistles were enough to cook lentils. rice. potatoes etc.. This cooker does not blow the whistle by itself (starts rocking) but instead I manually let out the steam 4-5 times. Saves a lot of energy and cooks quickly. I have 2 dabbas ( containers ) from the previous cooker that fit inside this cooker. That way I can cook Dal and rice at once. Definitely recommend this cooker. I ordered an extra gasket just in case :) Always better to keep extra gaskets"
2,"My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.  Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.  What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating. & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.  I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.  This one is so much quieter. too.  Tonight. I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.  You can't beat that.  The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.  I should have bought this years ago."
2,"Been using pressure cookers for years - grew up on a farm - pressure cookers abundant.Needed to replace the 30+ year old Mirro aluminum one.Still have my aluminum 2 1/2 qt Mirro but wanted a bigger one.So I bought this one to try. Cookers are all basically the same.HOWEVER -----I wish SOMEone would have posted SOMEwhere that this product is- wait for it - - -MADE IN CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA!Oh I get it - if we are told it is not USA made. we will look elsewhere.What a rip! I am so very disappointed that we cannot purchase something made in the USA anymore.Thanks to all our government officials by helping every one on this planet but our own people.We cannot even buy a cooking pot for cripes sake!Let's see if in another 30 years I still have this CHINESE pot.For cryin' out loud.......................  :o("
2,"I prefer meat browned. and veggies either raw. stirfried. fermented or roasted. so I got this primarily for making bone broths. cooking legumes and cooking whole grains.I got the 4-quart as it's just me and hubby here. but I did not realize you can't fill this more than 2/3rd full.  Now I wish I'd have ordered the 6-quart.Even though it's stainless. it's very lightweight.  This is handy as I have permanent chest pain after surgery. so lifting can be difficult.It works fine.  It makes very concentrated fast broths in the summer when I don't want things simmering on the stove for hours.  Similarly. I can cook big batches of legumes and freeze in meal-sized portions fast.  I haven't tried grains yet as I was on a risotto kick when this arrived. and then went on a temporary grain-free diet.I am quite satisfied. except I wish I'd gotten the larger one."
2,"Amazing quality ... made a whole chicken in less than 30min... juicy and perfect.. moist... cleans up beautifully... Very pleased with this product!...Just wanted to add a note.. I never run water over the pan to cool it down...as it is still cooking.. I know how long meat and veggies take when cooking traditionally. so I time it based on experience. When you let it cool on it's own. that is part of the actual cooking time with the pressurization. Follow the instructions and you can't go wrong.  I just shut the fire down about 10min less to incorporate cool down... Any longer would be overdone..."
2,"I've used pressure cookers for many years including some of those very expensive models.  This is one of the best cookers I've ever owed.  This cooker is constructed of high quality stainless steel and is very easy to use.  Pressure cookers are very safe. If you follow a few simple rules. you'll never have a problem.  I use my cooker weekly for everything from cream of potato soup to braised lamb shanks with wine sauce.  Additionally. it is amazingly cheap to own. My only con: wish it was made in the USA. otherwise. highly recommend."
2,"They are so quick and efficient.  When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep. that's how much I love them.  My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.  However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.  So he bought me this smaller version.  Obviously it weighs less. takes up less room in my cupboard. and comes to heat much quicker.  What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!"
2,"If the handles fit tighter without wobbling I'd love it but you cant complain too much for the $25 or so I paid. Good things are its not too big. the lid goes on real smooth. the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go. when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move. lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of."
2,"I've looked and checked out many other pressure cookers before buying this one. From the costly ones in department stores to others online. Department stores prices were to high and I couldn't get any product information from the sales people I would talk with. After reading the reviews here I decided to purchase the Presto. Best choice I've made. The arrival was within a few days. The Cooker is great looking after using it for four different meals. We have enjoyed a delicious pot roast. chicken with veggies. and a hard to cook oxtail stew. There was no problem with reading the directions on how to use. I did it without my husband my assistance. (he's better with gagets). I am planning on using it at least once a week for hardy winter meals."
2,"This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.  I am happy about 'stainless steel' because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made. top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that. I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."
2,"It's been several months since I've purchased the Presto 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker. and I have to admit that this cooker packs some seriously power!  Having a pressure cooker speeds up cooking so much - I've been able to make a lot of Chinese Soups in a fraction of the time it takes to make normally!  This pot is especially good when cooking soups with proteins. particularly beans and meat.  Because it cooks so quickly. we're not only enjoying dinner faster. but saving a lot of energy to boot!  Highly recommended!"
2,"As a child I was scared to death of my mom's pressure cooker and swore I'd never have one.  But this one is very  nice.  There are two ways to cook with it after the little toggle starts rocking you are instructed to (1) put the pot under water and it cools down all at once. or (2) let it cool down on its own.  If you are instructed to let it cool down on its own. it can take up to 30 minutes to cool down. I thought cooking with this would be a lot quicker; but that aside. it is a great way to have something that really does cook in a fraction of the time it normally takes to cook something; but it is not a &#34;microwave&#34; quick type of instrument."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
2,"My mom brought a pressure cooker from Brasil 15 years ago. and on our last trip she was not able to find replacement rubber gaskets for it. I talked her into replacing it for something new. shiny and fancy. The quality is there. and the locking mechanism is STRONG. It's not a latch on the handle like a traditional pressure cooker. This unit has slots all around the pan that link up to the lid. and you rotate the lid to seal the unit. That means there's more than 8 latches on the pan. Those beans aren't getting out any time soon."
2,"I had this in my wishlist & received it for Christmas.  I've used it several times & I love it.  Its smaller than the one I had previously but that is perfect for us.  Only 3 at home anymore.I love that this is made of stainless steel.  The insert is still made of aluminum which Im not thrilled about but I dont have to use it if I dont want to.This pressure cooker is also a lot quieter than my old one is.  I appreciate that a LOT!Its a great product and Im so happy to have it."
2,"The handle for the pot is secured with only one screw. The handle itself is curved to fit against the pot. but the directions emphasize multiple times that you shouldn't overtighten to avoid cracking the plastic.  I tightened it reasonably and when the pot is full and it's tilted to pour out the contents (boiling water for example). the handle wobbles/turns slightly.  I can easily see this becoming a hazard with continued use/failure to retighten regularly.  Fortunately. Amazon was willing to accept the return.  The company could resolve this problem by using metal on the edge of the handle piece. selling their pots pre-assembled in a more sturdy manner. or hey- bright idea- USING TWO FASTENERS LIKE EVERY OTHER POT MANUFACTURER.  Hmm."
2,"Before purchasing this pressure cooker. I went to Macy's and bought an aluminum pressure cooker because it was on sale.  Got it home and tried it out.  After cooking my meal. I noticed the inside of the pressure cooker had become terribly discolored. I did not want my family eating out of that pressure cooker.  So I immediately took it back.  I purchased the Presto 6-qt. pressure cooker and I do love it.  It is stainless steel. easy clean-up and no discoloration.  I should have known better because I had a Presto for over 25 years.  The rocker on my old one wore out and I knew it was time to get another.  If you're looking to replace an older model or just plain looking for a new pressure cooker. you won't be disappointed with this one."
2,"This purchase was one of the first times that Amazon reviews let me down. As others have recently stated. it seems Presto has changed manufacturing of the screws. making the handles of this pressure cooker unsteady...no matter how many times I tighten the screws. and how tight I. or my husband. try to get them. they loosen and the handles become very wobbly. This is not just a problem with one handle. but both handles! I tried this item for a week. which required retightening the handles about a dozen times. and I have given up.Additionally. after only two washes. the screws are already starting to rust! I didn't wash it in the dishwasher. it was by hand.I can understand why this is an inexpensive product...it is cheaply made! However. I am baffled at why it gets such good reviews."
2,"One upon a time. many years ago.. I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well. time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work. I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home. I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!"
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
2,"I've owned several pressure cookers over the years.  This one is my current favorite for several reasons.  First. I like the 4-qt. size.  It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.  Next. I'm happy with the  quality of the product.  It's hefty enough to feel substantial. yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.  The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.  Last. this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt. model.  I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one. but I like the speed.  I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.  I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again."
2,"This seems to be a high quality product at a very reasonable price.  It cooks less expensive cuts of beef (stew meat. chuck roast. corned beef) to mouth watering tenderness in a fraction of the time required in either an oven or slow cooker.  It quickly cooks two or three pounds of chicken for salads. sandwiches. or freezing.  Cook a pork roast with your favorite barbeque sauce in 30-45 minutes and enjoy pulled pork sandwiches infused with the flavor of the sauce.  This would be a great tool for the cook who likes make- ahead meals and stocking the freezer for quick-reheating weekday dinners.  Get the stainless steel model to avoid the reaction of aluminum to acidic foods.  Eventually you will be glad you did.The clad base is very heavy so I wouldn't recommend using the pan for pasta or vegetables but if you have strong wrists and arms you could do this.  Other lids are available from Presto."
2,"My wife is from Brazil. so she is a foremost authority on pressure cookers as they use them there for almost every meal daily.Originally I tried the very cheap aluminum alternative for $15 on sale at Sears. and it failed after one use.This is better than the ones that last 20 years in Brazil. It's efficient. it's durable. it's just plain a good product. and you really shouldn't pay more for a pressure cooker than $40-$50 as it's a very simple item."
2,"I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.  I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto. missed it and decided to get another one.  The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.  This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.  The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.  It seems to be pretty stout overall.  I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks."
2,"This is an investment every house cook should make. The meats come out super duper tender and it takes no time at all. 10 min and your chicken for soup or any dish is ready! The top is very very sturdy so do not worry about it coming off or exploding while under pressure. I love my pressure cooker and this smaller size is perfect for my husband and I since it's just the two of us. And remember to always get STAINLESS STEEL. Aluminium eventually peels off and isn't as durable. plus it's toxic for you. Oh. and cleaning is a snap!!! Dishwasher safe and even is  you do it by hand. nothing sticks :) good purchase"
2,"Gas and electricity has gone up so much lately. Pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster.  It comes with a compact user guide and a small cookbook.Pressure cookers can be dangerous. so make sure to read the safety precautions. Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity. You cannot open the lid while it is still pressurized with the built-in precautionary lock. but the rocker valve can easily get toppled and extremely hot steam can escape through it.Pros:- Stainless steel. You do not want aluminum for health reasons.- We have been using this for more than 5 years.  We just have to replace the rubber gasket around the lid.- Although not as cheap as we like it to be. if you compare it to other manufacturers. you still save some money.Cons:- The pressure valve rocker. Other pressure cookers (but more expensive) has a  non-removable pressure valve.  It is often get misplaced.- The rocker makes quite a bit noise."
2,"Get the Presto. They're all the same. It's a simple design. a pot and lid. I've been using them for 20 years and the expensive ones are no better than the Presto- Only an amateur cook would believe different. The Prestos cook just as good and just as fast as the Rikons. My kitchen is filled with the best and most expensive equipment money can buy. but when it comes to pressure cookers. it's not like other cookware where you 'get what you pay for.'  They're all the same (although I don't recommend the electric ones as they have a tendency to break down). Save your money for the good espresso maker... don't waste it on expensive pressure cookers. Get the Presto."
2,"As many folks out there. including Anthony Bourdain I too was scared of pressure cookers. After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual. as if for a school test. The rocker type is really totally harmless! Cooking times are slashed by at least two thirds. less gas and therefor less escaped heat and better inefficiency make this cooking method a winner. Cleanup is also very quick. The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat. which is essential for good flavor. Anne Burrell always says:&#34;Brown Food tastes Good&#34;."
2,"I have always been afraid of pressure cookers because as a child my mother always banned me from the kitchen when she was using one. Well. twenty some odd years later I finally purchased this one.  I read the instruction booklet and the first night made mashed potatoes and a pot roast.  Wow!  My 12 year old son loved the meal and said these mashed potatoes were the best he ever ate and the meat was so tender.  It was so easy to use and easy to clean.  I am already planning on making BBQ pork ribs next!  Whoo-Hoo! Buy it! Use it!....but read the instructions first! Enjoy:-)"
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
2,"I bought this pressure cooker to make chili. I've never owned or used a pressure cooker and was a bit nervous when I fired it up for the 1st time. It heat up real quick using a ceramic glass cook top. and I was to able to brown the meat realitively quick. The contruction of this pressure cooker looks very high quality and well made. The only thing I wanna add is be very careful with when to lower the heat and when to move the steam controlling top on the top. You can lower the heat as soon as you see steam coming out of the bottom of steam controlling top. and be very careful not to touch the top until the nipple on the handle drops down. indicating that there's no pressure in the cooker. Good investment!"
2,"Sadly returning this.  The handles won't stay tight and the screws that hold them are already rusting. Plus hard to get it up to pressure - too much sputtering around the handle for a long time!  I remember my Mother cooking delicious tender meats in her pressure cooker years ago.  But I did not have good results with this one. Followed directions and chicken came out tough.  And - a magnet won't stick to the interior (only the exterior)...so maybe the interior is not stainless steel. but aluminum..which is not what I want to cook my food in. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy."
2,"My Mom always told me horror stories about pressure cooker. but I really wanted one after listening to my friend's successful experience with it. I got this 4-quart one several weeks ago. and I am super happy with it!!  I have been pulling an entire beef top round and pork shoulder straight out of FREEZER to cook in pressure cooker. and I was able to serve dinner in an hour.  It's perfect for a poor planner like me.I did read the manual over and over to make sure it is safe. and yes. it is safe!"
2,"I have had the 4 quart pressure cooker for quite some time.  and based on its performance.  I purchased the 6 quart for myself and one for my daughter as well.  We are very pleased.  This is a good product.  but it is important to read and follow the instructions for use and care in order to get the most satisfactory results. I was raised with Presto pressure cookers. and have used others.  None have performed better. in my opinion.  The reasonable price is an added bonus.5/10/08: Presto offers a stainless steel steamer basket and a glass lid as optional accessories that fit both their 4 qt. and 6 qt. pressure cookers.  I purchased the steamer for my daughter and myself.  and the lid for myself.  These products have been welcome additions to our cooking tools.  Do not be afraid to spend the extra money for them...they are well worth it!"
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
2,"I've used a 6-qt. aluminum pressure cooker for years.  It finally bit the dust so I decided to try a stainless steel cooker.  This one is taller. but not as wide. as my previous cooker.  However. it is plenty big to hold a 3-4 pound chicken or roast. which is what I usually cook in it.  So far I really like it - and no problems yet with hardware rusting like I've read in a few reviews.  I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a not-too-big pressure cooker!"
2,"This is my first pressure cooker and I really like it.  For this price. it is a good choice for those who aren't sure if they will use it much.  It is especially useful for vegetarians.  Beans that normally take 2 hours to simmer in a sauce pan are done in 20 minutes in the pressure cooker.  I was afraid to use it at first but there are safety features which should make you comfortable using it.  As long as it is under pressure. you cannot open the top.Although I do like this product. it is overly large for my needs.  If you just plan on cooking a cup or two of beans at a time. I would recommend getting the 4 qt version of this product.  Because the pressure cooker is so fast. there's really no need to make large batches of things."
2,"I love my pressure cooker. Super reliable and if you follow the directions. it always cooks perfectlly Brown rice is cooked in 12 minutes! My first lesson was to factor in the amount of time it takes for the pressure cooker to cool down enough to open the lid. That usually takes another 10 minutes - if you are trying to orchestrate all your food being ready at the same time for a hot meal. I am guessing the cool down time is also part of the cooking process. The instruction/cook book that comes with it is very right on and helpful. Very east to clean. make sure you take out the rubber gasket from the lid and clean it well after each use. I have read that pressure cooking retains more nutrients in the food than any other type of cooking. Makes sense because so little steam or anything escapes."
2,"So we've had this vacuum cleaner for a bit over a  year now. It was purchased September 8. 2009.Currently. my wife is complaining that the vacuum is not providing enough suction to pick up the dirt. The bag in the back was emptied so we know that's not the problem. Time is going to be spent trying to figure out what's wrong with it. and it may be finished das far as I know.My impression of the vacuum over time hasn't been that great. It performed rather poorly on hardwood flooring from the start. and I can't say I was overly impressed on carpet. It's clunky to move around. and when the bag approaches full it tends to tip over."
2,"I've been vacuuming for over 40 years and I enjoy trying new products.I have a myriad of machines. from $100.00 to $1400.00.  No matter what I try. Eureka makes the best vacuuming products and this particular model is best for carpets.  The ergonomics are perfect. but the singularly winning aspect of this machine is it's strong suction and firm grabbing power as you pull it back toward yourself. It's easy use is a huge plus for me - no need to disassemble. re-arrange. clean or empty trays. reassemble. etc.  I just tap the 'On' button. release the handle and go.  I'll buy one of these for every floor in the house and keep each plugged in and ready to go."
2,"I've only had this vacuum for 2 months but it's everything the other reviews said it was.  It's light and easy to maneuver.  I have two long hair cats and it has no problem with all of the shedding.  I like the carpet level adjustment so I can do the bare floor as well as the carpet (for thorough cleaning I use a small wand vacuum for the bare floors).  Assembly is a cinch. took me under 1/2 hour.  Returned my Oreck in favor of this one."
2,"My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them.  I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag.  I am very pleased with it.  It is fairly quiet for a vacuum cleaner. my old model used to scream like a banshee.  and it doesn't have a bunch of hoses wrapped around it constantly coming loose like my old model.  It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model.If you just need to vacuum the floor. this model is great."
2,"We purchased this unit originally for our own use. because our relatives had one of these always available happily for decades. but later. we shared this unit with a close family who needed it to help them with maintenance of newly refurbished wood flooring. and now that WE are writing this review. WE are reminded that WE really need to purchase another of these units in the not too distant future. hopefully still available from Amazon. when it comes time for us to make another purchase of it. because WE feel after years of family use. that this type of unit really is the BEST to use to clean and polish floors and make the job at hand the easiest possible. and the family we shared our other unit with. also voiced this same response to us as well. Blessings to you in all your floor maintenance adventures."
2,"My Mom bought me one of these from Walmart when I was in middleschool. Ive kept it ever since... Its lasted through highschool. going to summer camp. it went to college with me (I used it as extra seating and as a bed a couple of times). It made it through moving 3 times after college and the only reason it didnt deploy with me (much better than Army Toughboxes) is that it didnt have wheels. its lasted half a lifetime and still doesnt even have a strach on it. I love this thing!"
2,"I got the 35-gallon size to store some items in the basement that I wanted to be able to get to conveniently but also be able to lock up and keep out of the kids' hands. This box is absolutely perfect for what I intended. Maybe even a bit of overkill on my part (this thing is super solid) but better safe than sorry. It is very well made. Of course. I'm not truly putting it through its paces by using it in a truck bed or travelling through air ports with it or anything like that. but after receiving it and having a chance to see how well made it is. I have little doubt it would excel for those uses as well.Note: If you are looking on putting a lock on it. I recommend you get the 'cable' style of Master combo lock that Amazon suggests. The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock. Not impossible. but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable."
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
2,"Excellent durability.  Good space inside and latches closed.  Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.  As built now. you will need two people to handle this huge bin.  Would also help if the handholds were deeper.  Overall. very good.Update 11/22/11:  Not as durable as I had originally thought.  Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split. so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid.  And yes. the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.  Still. it's a decent box that continues to function okay."
2,"I purchased 2 of the 24 Gallon size. one to use as an emergency medical supply container and one to utilize as a portable survival (bug out) box. I found that the 24 gallon size is plenty large enough for each of my intended uses. I kept my items limited to what was most basic and necessary and I still have room for some additional items.I am pleased that I got the 24 gallon size for my purposes because even when they are packed I can still lift them and they are easily transportable. I would think a larger size container that was packed may be too heavy to handle without help.I have posted some pictures. they have hard plastic handles that snap into position and they have a place for you to lock then. Sturdy enough construction and appear to be rugged and durable."
2,"I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many. many (20?) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps. It has sat out in broiling sun. freezing winter. pouring rain. and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy. I was delighted to see that these were still available. and the new one looks just like the old one. but with brighter colors (and less dirt!) It should be good for another 20 years!"
2,"Here's the question: does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry?  Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo?  If so. then this isn't for you if it's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier.  OTOH. if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate. then it'll do that OK.  I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.  It's *pretty* tight... but not totally so.  It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm."
2,"I installed two Lasko 3012 fans in my fitness room after some modifications to enable them to mount them directly over the power receptacles which are at 72 inches above the floor.I replaced the existing room duplex wall receptacles with the Leviton 688 recessed receptacle and modified the fan by removing all but about 20 inches of power cord and drilling a 1.75 inch hole in the back of the fan allowing the remainder of the cord and the rear of the plug to recess into the fan. The end result is that there is no power cord showing (just like in the picture (where the power cord must have been removed)). The Leviton 688 and fan mounting plate also had to be modified just slighting in order to accommodate each other. Naturally. I tested the fans before making the modifications which were not difficult at all.The fans aren't noisy and they move plenty of air on low speed."
2,"Fed-Ex just dropped it at my door a matter of minutes ago.  Thought I would give it quick test on the kitchen floor.  WOW!  Floor clean in seconds.  Before I realized it. the entire 2 bedroom apartment was clean in a couple of minutes.  It whizzed across the ceramic tile floors and short nap throw rugs.  Who knew this kind of power could be had for 65 dollars?  Excellent value.  How can such a light weight vacuum have so much power?  It took me longer to write this review then vacuum the entire apartment.  I love it."
2,"I used to own a Mighty Light. which is a very similar vacuum from Eureka.Used that one for about 5-6 years until it finally broke.This thing is slightly stronger and a little louder.This vacuum does a great job getting dust and Cat hair from just about anything(carpet. velvet drapes). Best part is you do not have to run the thing over every inch of the surface (unlike other small canisters). it's powerful enough to suck dust in even when it's in the close proximity."
2,"I like this vacuum and am glad I purchased it.  The price was good and for hard floors it it easy to use and is quite powerful.  One complaint that I do have is that because of the bend in the hose handle sometimes clogs occur if you accidentally vacuum up something like paper or large pieces of something.  It is hard to clear it but the suction hole in the handle helps enable you to 'fish out' whatever is in there.  I wish that the handle was not bent.  It may make it easy to hold but the tendency for clogging is greatly increased.  Other than that I have no complaints.  You cannot beat the price and for hard surfaces it works better than any upright I have owned.  For the carpet in my bedrooms I do use an upright for so I would not suggest using this for plush carpet. However it does work well on area rugs and low pile carpets."
2,"Let's be honest: this is an inexpensive vacuum and yet. it lives up to everything the manufacturer says it does.  I have a Dyson that is amazing on carpet -  but I recently moved to a condo that has all hardwood floors and it just wasn't doing the job. With the recent move. I didn't want to spend more than a $100 dollars but also didn't want to regret my purchase.  After carefully reading the reviews here - I decided on the Eureka.Here are some pros:1. Amazing suction power2. Super lightweight3. Very long extension - can reach high places easily4. The hose where it connects to the vacuum rotates. creating smooth movement5. Nice long cordHere are the cons:1. The extension tubes sometimes don't stay attached while vacuuming (can be annoying)2. The opening under the floor tool does not extend the width to the edges (but the suction power makes up for it)I hope this was helpful!"
2,"After our quite old Eureka canister vacuum had finally gone belly up. we were looking for an appropriate replacement.  Because this was needed primarily for cleaning hardwood floors. there were a few critical criteria.  It had to be strong. yet compact in size.  It should not be too loud. and the tool assortment should be appropriate for floors and vacuuming cat hair of various furniture items.  Finally. we did not want to have to mess around with cleaning out bagless vacuum containers.  The Eureka Mighty Mite 3670 came through with flying colors on all fronts.  It produces a powerful vacuum. easily maneuverable. convenient for storing. the noise is not too bad. and a good price.  This vacuum cleaner gives an excellent value. and. certainly. gets the job done that we bought it for."
2,"I can only give this a 3. Tools are to small-the motor has a w h i n e to it that drives me nuts! The motor also seems to get very hot--maybe I got a dud and just don't know it. The hoses are stiff-no flexibility at all. I do like a canister vacuum though as opposed to an upright-at least this one follows me around and doesn't knock me out when I pull it along. All in all it is an OK product but they could have done a much better job with the design--you must wrap the cord on the bottom for storage-not a useful feature at all--does it work ok? Sure it does. Should you buy it? Only if you don't mind all the above draw backs."
2,"I didn't expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum.  I was purchasing to vacuum cat and dog hair on my carpeted stairs and to vacuum my car.  This little 'mighty mite' packs a big punch.  Superb suction. compact and light weight. but does not feel flimsy.  When researching this purchase I found the other customer reviews helpful. and I also found other references to this model as being one of the better canister compacts.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum."
2,"I've had one of these for a couple of months and so far. so good.  It is loud but tolerable.  I think the bags are easy to change -- as with most vacuums. I recommend not waiting until a bag is overfull or things get messy. The long hose is good for reaching under things but makes it a bit of a pain to store.  I think the plastic it is made of is a bit cheap and I wonder if it will hold up over time.  I didn't want to spend a lot though and think it's a good product for the price."
2,"Probably best vaccuum I have ever owned. I only ever buy stand up vacuums but this one had great reviews and I thought. what the heck. It is really light. I hardly ever notice it trailing along behind me. and it has a really good suction! I love the long hose and different attachments. Whereas I used to just vacuum my rugs. now my cleaning routine consists of me vacuuming everything in my house. I mean everything. Lol. It goes from hardwood to carpet easily. the bags last a long time. There are 2 cons on this product in my opinion. 1) the cord does not retract. and 2) the hose is somewhat thin and occasionally kinks. It does seem the hose won't last long but I can't imagine it is much to replace."
2,"My law office is 2.000 square feet of carpeted and tiled floors. We have an upright and a steam vac for the carpets and they do fine. I bought this 3670G 12 amp Eureka mainly for the tiled floors. cleaning the drapes and (because of its long wands) hard to reach places behind desks and work tables. I am very pleased with it. It uses bags. but that is a good feature for us as we like bags when pulling up dust and dust mites (the bags are cheap as I just bought 24 for $12). I do not recommend this vacuum for carpets in general because the large attachment you see in the photo is not a brush attachment (it does come with a smaller brush attachment for drapes and hard to reach spots). But for sucking up loose junk on tile and in between tiles it is great. It is also great for cleaning drapes (floor to ceiling) and hard to reach spots because of the long wand extensions.  Would buy again if needed. 4 stars"
2,"This powerful little light-weight machine cleans my house in no time. When the bag gets full. pop out that one and replace it with a new one. My house is about 1500 square feet with only one small area rug. No. it's not great on the rug. But the floors with dog and cat hair. dust bunnies and garden bits tracked in are clean in no time. Then I vacuum the big velvet couch and other furniture. dog pillows. and even the cob webs that appear now and again. This was a marginally careful purchase. My last Mighty Mite lasted for twelve years. the previous one for eight. Hard to look at another brand for vacuuming for me."
2,"The Eureka vacuum itself is amazing.  It is very powerful in such a small unit. It is surprised me at the first time when I used it. There is a small vent hole in conjunction of the handler. I accedentally put my left hand over the hole (I should xeal the hole first). The vacuum suck force made a bruise on my hand.The unit is very convinient (portable). I used it for the hard wood floor and on my Mini-Van. I do not need to buy another one for my mini-van."
2,"I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum.  I hate this vacuum and here is why:  It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic. cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction.  The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air.  The body is cheap plastic.  The unit is difficult to manuever. the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog. 2 cats. a baby. hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it.  I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully.  I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap."
2,"I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS!  It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT!  The on/off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one.  Came here to Amazon. marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history (IN 24 HOURS!) BUT...even though the machine itself does a great job. the parts are CHEAP!  The hose is not flexible. twists all the time. I wish I had saved the hose from the old one; the electric cord is awful. very stiff. very hard to wrap around the handle. and gets easily tangled in itself.  I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just doesn't cut it; next time. I'll get another brand."
2,"I recently put in hardwood floors and was looking for a light vacuum to use that would be quick to get the job done.  This vacuum is amazing! Strong suction. light enough to carry around with one hand. and I vacuumed the main level of my house literally in 5 minutes!  My husband put a strap on it too so I can wear it on my shoulder.  It makes doing the stairs very easy. The cord doesn't retract. which is kind of annoying. but I'm willing to out up with that.  The hose pieces/extender just attach with pressure and a few times they have come apart. but they would likely be fine if I get my husband to push the pieces together.  Overall very happy with this purchase."
2,"I purchased this Mighty Mite to replace one I had over 15 years.  The only things on this new one that even comes close in comparrison are the power of the motor - which is good. and the extension wands.  The hose is so poor quality that it folded and cut off the air flow on my first use!! the housing feels like it will crack if you bump it into something. the wheels are not much better.  The motor makes for good suction. that is really the only positive I can give on this unit.  The old gray model I had since the late 80's was wonderful! I replaced that one with an Oreck. but wanted to go back to something with wheels on the floor for touch-ups. baseboards. overhead cleaning. etc."
2,"I bought this because I have bare floors with just a few scatter rugs.  It works great on the floors. and is easy to move around. with a very long cord.  I would only rate it as adequate on rugs - it works fairy well on low pile. but not well on high piles. and has a very hard time getting cat hair up.  The pieces of tube that make up the nozzle have a nasty tendency to separate. and so I have duct-taped them together.Pros:  long cord. great on bare floors. light and easy to manouverCons:  ability to handle cat hair. deep-piled carpets. tubes don't stay together"
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
2,"The Eureka Mighty Mite is made in China.I bought mine from Amazon in September 2011. so just over a year ago.  It has very good suction. and it is cheap.  The attachments aren't very effective. but overall. it is a pretty good vacuum.  I have a golden retriever. so the vacuum is a little overmatched. but considering it is about $60. I have no complaints whatsoever.I did just buy a more expensive vacuum. which is much better. Mighty Mite is now my teams backup QB. I hope I don't need to use him. but I am confident that if our number 1 goes down with an injury the Mighty Mite knows the playbook. and can perform capably under center.Go Bears!"
2,"My unit is an older model which is called &#34;The Boss&#34; but is the very same as this.  Mine has EXCELLENT suction and I don't mind that it is a little noisy.  Mine is used for cleaning up around the woodstove.  It does an excellent job of sucking up ash and wood particles of various sizes.  I don't understand the negative reviews. unless these people received &#34;lemons&#34;.  I would highly recommend this vac for small jobs. I don't think it was intended to be used for  whole house vacuuming."
2,"This is one of the best household products I ever bought.  This is a very powerful little unit and makes all those hard to clean areas a snap to clean.  I don't know what I did without this before.  From day one it was in use.  I now can get all the floor corners and ceiling corners that were so hard to get with a regular Vacuum and attachments.  And. you can vacuum your car with this too.  You can't go wrong with this canister vac."
2,"This is a great basic vacuum. It is great for my small apartment. I have a low pile IKEA rug and it works amazing on it as well as my hardwood. I like how simply each piece just fits into each other without any buttons to get broken off. My only complaint that it has a little sliding piece to remove big debris before it gets sucked into the accordian part of the hose. That sliding mechanism is great. but it's exactly where you put your hands when you vacuum. So. from time to time it opens and you lose a little suction and it has pinched my hand. That said. i can always slap a piece of tape on that part. because otherwise this vac is so good. Suction is really great. Cant beat it for the price."
2,"We needed a new vacuum and I could not decide on what i really wanted. So far this thing has been pretty sweet for the price. Your are obviously not going to get quiet. super cyclone. bagless. blah blah blah and I was not expecting that. This thing is loud. takes bags and has is not easy to store. But it does the job we needed and that is what counts.I am taking one star off because I really wish there was a place to clip the hose and attachment tubes to the housing for better storage. Other than that. color me impressed."
2,"I bought the Mighty Mite about a year ago and have been very pleased.  On the plus side. it has very strong suction and enough nozzle variety to get the job done. It is light weight and easy to store.  It is perfect for small apartment living. Minor negatives is that the light weight accordion hose sometimes kinks and because the vac is light weight. it will may tip about when you are moving around with it.  There is no beater brush. but the brush on the nozzle and the great suction make up for it.  For what you pay. it is a very good purchase."
2,"I hate. absolutely HATE. having debris on our hardwood floors. So I did a lot of research and found this vacuum. It has a very powerful suction AND it doesn't scratch our floors. It is also lightweight and has a very long cord. So when I vacuum. I usually gently tug the vacuum while holding the hose and the little guy follows me around like a loyal companion. It is very versatile and includes different attachments to suit your vacuuming needs. Changing of the bag is easy and mess-free. At first I thought it would suck having an old-school vacuum bag (unlike today's &#34;just empty the dirt out of the canister&#34;) but NO! It's all super easy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this vacuum."
2,"The vacuum does a good job and does have terrific suction.  But the hose is very flimsy and is constantly getting kinks (which makes it get REALLY noisy till you straighten it out).  Then the wand. right where you need to put your hand to grab it. has a 'Slip Ring' which you can open to reduce suction (like for doing drapes).  Problem is that it's always opening up so you have to stop to shut it.  These two things get very annoying."
2,"I LOVE THIS VACUUM. it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes. Eureka has a winner on it's hands. I especially LOVE the old 'tank' design as opposed to the current square 'canister' design all vacuums companies are now using. Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market. So many pluses  but just to name a few...extra long cord. massive suction. long hose.I only have 1 negative comment:When vacuuming you are restricted to back and forth straight line vacuuming and I could see how this would be an issue for some."
2,"Purchased the 3670G via Amazon. Just arrived and immediately plugged it into my Kill-A-Watt. The device shows amperage draw on anything plugged into it and it shows the Mite is only drawing 10amps.Either I received the 10amp model that other reviewers have posted about (old reviews though... two year old reviews) or the mfg is lying about it's capabilities.Having said all that. it's a nice. simple. lightweight machine that really sucks (in a good way). but I can't help but wonder how much better it would perform if it was truly the 12amp model.If any other reviewers have any advice. please post a comment."
2,"This is a wonderful vacuum for hardwood floors (or tile. viynl ect.) will not work on carpet so don't even try.  Makes handy vacuum to clean up after small projects like hanging blinds(saw dust).We have two dogs and 2000 plus Sq ft of hardwoods in our new home and my wife was going crazy trying to keep them clean with swiffers. bought her this on amazon and recieved it in 2 days (prime) we botha are tall (5'10' and 6'4') and love the long handle no more bending over. wish the brush attachments were better but we have extra from our other vacuums.Again for hard surfaces this is a 5 star all the way."
2,"Bought this vacuum cleaner for those hard-to-reach places which I can't get to with the upright.  The canister is light and easy to carry around. the tools are also very light (to the point of being a bit flimsy) and do the job.  The strength of suction can be adjusted using a simple rotating collar on the tool extension tube but it is not a snug fit so it tends to move rather too easily during cleaning.  The general level of suction however is good and it picks up most dust and dirt without trouble.  It does seem to work especially well on tile."
2,"Nice and easy to handle machine with a strong motor. easy to clean filter and good accessory package.  Overall this is a good little vacuum for cleaning stairs and car interiors. However. it has 2 problems.  First. the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily.  It has no reinforcing. so you don't want to step on it or bend it around a corner.  Second. the hose is a corrugated pipe style with accordion pleats the entire length.  This gives the hose a little strength. but it makes it very prone to clogs and things sticking in the folds.  I have learned to check the vacuum suction each time I use it.  If it feels weak. I need to take off the hose and shake it clean.  In good clean condition. it works as well as any canister."
2,"The suction on this little machine is unreal.  Sure. the parts are made of plastic and with careless throwing around. parts will break.  But if you are careful and don't step on the hose. you'll find this is a gem.  I have no carpets; just 2 throw rugs with non-rubber backing.  The 'carpet' feature totally cleans these rugs.  The floor feature is just what I need for my 2 floors of hardwood.  And the price?  OMG. if it quits in 2 years. I will have gotten my money's worth."
2,"Needed a small. light duty. vacuum for our store.  After checking various reviews. purchased this item from Amazon.  It is compact. lightweight. has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag. which I prefer.  It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord.  We use it for bare floors and low-pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations.  Three minor. non deal-breaking negative elements are - 1) the hose and tubes are friction fit and can disconnect easily; 2) The hose is corregated plastic and seems a bit cheap; 3)the power cord has a wrap-up rather than retractable storage mechanism.  But. the cord wrap-up holder is well designed and located.  I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed.  All. in all. this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive. convenient vacuum."
2,"This is an awesome little machine for the money. Yea... The plastic is a little cheap and it is a little loud but you cannot beat the price or the power. It is perfect for hard surface floors. No it does not leave marks on wood floors. If you drag the cord under the wheels you'll get a mark from the wax on the cord but most people with a hint of intelligence should know better. No the canister does not easily tip over. I honestly don't know where some of these silly reviews are coming from. This is a great little vacuum for the price. If you want perfect go spend two hundred dollars."
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
2,"The vacuum is very light and powerful enough for bare floors. I've owned a few of them. One burnt out because the person using it was trying to save on bags and repeatedly let it get too full.  Another one lost a wheel. but it is so light it is easy to carry. Most of all the light weight makes it so that I am never reluctant to take it out and use it as I might be with a heavier vacuum.  It has a surprising amount of power. but I am not sure you would want it as your only vacuum for rugs. It is certainly not the vacuum you would buy for extensive wall-to-wall carpeting.  The previous ones I've owned have lasted for very many years."
2,"This is my second Eureka.  The first a Eureka  100 - a BIG Floor standing Model.  This died on me after fifteen years.  Was too big and heavy.The Mighty Mite was ordered and delivered within one week.Tried it out the same day - This machine S U C K S !! (I mean the DUST)The lightweight is very handy.  Did my 3 Bedroon unit with upstairs and stairs without much effort.  The extra brushes. and long handle and tubes are very good for window sills and odd corners.  Does hard floors well.The free shippind was a great help.  With a little addition to qualify for FREE SHIPPING - I got the Bissell Featherweight Bagless. which I ordered together for areally great deal.A very good buy through Amazon.  Very Happy with machine. Thanks Amazon for assisting  in the Free Shipping."
2,"I am very happy with this cordless vacuum.  I had previously purchased the Hoover Linx (approx $150) - which I loved.  However. the Linx roller stopped working within a year.  I purchased a second Linx - which also had had a problem with the roller.  So. I began looking for a much cheaper vacuum that would work. but be much cheaper to replace when needed.  The Eureka does not pick up as well as the Linx (which picked up as quickly as a standard vacuum). but it does pick up most items on a single swipe.  Heavier items may need 3 or 4 swipes with a change of direction.  I've had the Eureka for several months and it is working well.  All things considered. this is a much better value than the Hoover Linx."
2,"I've been using this for 1 and a half year.Batteries still charges fine and I can vacuum whole house (1200 sqft) with 2 batteries which comes with the vacuum.It's totally handy and vacuum well for hairs include pet's hairs which I really like it.It doesn't vacuum small rocks nor coins.The handle and the tank became really flimsy after a year of use. the dust tank doesn't fit to the body anymore. so it falls off easily.I am thinking to purchase the different vacuum soon.I hope this review helps :)"
2,"I bought this because my mom had one when I lived at home. and when I moved out on my own. I couldn't live without one. I believe this is the best cordless vacuum out there for the price. (I've tried Shark vacuums and they were awful.) The suction is great. It doesn't miss anything. It mounts easily on the wall. It's easy to dump the dust bin. The battery lasts long enough for me to vacuum three rooms using the carpet setting. I will own one of these for the rest of my life!PS: These make awesome housewarming or wedding gifts."
2,"One messy African Grey together with a kibble-strewing canine in a kitchen where bread is baked 3-4 times a week was driving me nuts. I was so tired of schlepping out the Dyson 2-3 times a day to vacuum the above mentioned mess. The Eureka Quick Up Cordless is my new best friend. It was ridiculously easy to assemble and mount the charger. The bonus battery pack ensures there is always plenty of power to get the job done. Because the Eureka Quick Up wasn't designed to suck the chrome off a truck's fender. don't expect it to take the place of a traditional vacuum. For those little messes that make you tired of dragging out and plugging in the big guns. the Eureka Quick Up is friggin' awesome!"
2,"I have a very large apartment with all bare floors. Once a week I sweep and use a dustbuster to pick up the piles. then wash all the floors using the Twist n Shout mop system. During that week. I use the dustbuster to just go over the floors between washings. Bending over using the dustbuster would just kill my back. I used this machine Sunday for the first time-wow-it's as strong as the dustbuster but I don't have to bend down at all. Today I used it again and got perfect results. I have a 55 lb. dog and it picks up all his hair with ease. I took the handle off and vacuumed my couch. I couldn't believe all the dog hair it swept up from the couch because I didn't even see the hair on the couch and my dog is black. Only reason to keep my dustbuster is to get behind the toilet and my tv stand. The Eureka doesn't fit there. Great Product!"
2,"This little Eureka vac works well for me to pick up cat litter. crumbs. and easily tackles quick clean ups on the hard surface floors around my home. It also works well to get pet hair off both carpeted and fabric surfaces; I've used the beater brush setting on my couch and has the couch looking new again every time. On carpets it does a good job grabbing surface dirt except when *really* close to the baseboards. I find it lightweight and easy to handle for quick tasks.I love that it came with two batteries so it's always ready to go. I don't use the extended handle portions so for me this stores in a really compact space. The beater brush setting can be on on or off. The dust cup is relatively easy to empty.This model provides just enough power for the tasks I need it to do and I leave the bigger tasks to my full size vacuum. Pleased with this purchase and recommended for light cleaning tasks on all flooring types and low to medium height carpet."
2,"It's a stick vacuum. folks. So it won't do much more on carpet than collect surface debris (like any stick vac. it's not designed to. though it does have a &#34;carpet&#34; setting) or solve big cleaning problems. But it will. from solid floors. remove crumbs. most dust bunnies smaller than bowling balls. dog and cat hair. and -- for those like us who have canaries or other pet birds -- all 2.000 feathers that each one of those little darlings drops during their annual molt.What I like best is that this model comes with TWO batteries. so I can keep one in the stick vac and one in the charger so the help I need is always at hand. For the price. I like this machine."
2,"I needed a vacuum but was at a loss because there are so many to choose from.  But one day in the doctor's office. I saw a clip of an asthma prevention program in California and they were recommending Eureka because unlike other vacuums. it doesn't blow the dust back out. Although this is not the exact same model. I like the portability of a cordless and it's a strong vacuum.  I have two dogs and I can get the whole apartment clean and it doesn't even lose its charge so I haven't used the spare battery yet.  It's easy to maneuver and there are two settings. one for carpet and one for bare floors.  It's also relatively quiet."
2,"When this first arrived. I was a bit disappointed by how unsubstantial this little machine felt. but I've just used it for the first time. and the second it hit the rug. I could feel a surprising amount of power. And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power. And when I emptied the dust cup (which was incredibly easy to do. by the way. and your hand goes on the inside of the cup. while the dirt is stuck to the outside. so your hands don't have to ever touch the dust) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up!I have a small one-bedroom apartment with very little storage space. and this tucks away easily behind the closet door.Well done. Eureka!"
2,"We're pretty pleased with this vacuum - it cleans our rug (it's a felt-type of material so it has very little pile) and cleans our wood floors well. I like that it has 2 battery packs - we've never had the disappointment of picking the vacuum up and realizing it's out of charge. The only issue was the first time I emptied it. dust flew all over me when I removed the cup from the vacuum. Also. the screw somehow came out of our handle and won't stay in anymore so the handle is pretty much useless now until we find a nut to use. The brush got pretty wrapped up in hair. but it was easy to cut free. Overall. a solid vacuum. but nothing insanely life changing."
2,"I bought this vacuum to keep bedroom and bathroom floors tidy.  All three people living in my house have long. brown hair and I can't stand when it gets on the floor!  The vacuum works well for touch up jobs. but it wouldn't work for heavy duty clean ups (like our pet rabbits room which gets covered with hay and fur..).  The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was that the hair got wrapped around the roller of the vacuum instead of being sucked up into the compartment and was very gross and tedious to remove!  It's perfect for use on the stairs. however. because it only weighs about 4 pounds!  As for the battery life-- I can vacuum about 2 medium sized rooms and a hallway before the battery wears out.  Definitely glad this one came with an extra battery so it can be switched out if you need to vacuum more."
2,"The vacuum is light weight. and picks up dirt and hair quite well.  It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.  The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.  I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.  The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging. but it's designed for wall hanging. and it slides on the counter. and the shape is not made for flat surfaces."
2,"This is a great cordless vac. I have two dogs and this picks up all the hair without getting clogged! (works great on floors- medium success with carpet so if you have carpet this may not be your solution). I have an Electrolux that was specifically advertised to be good for people with dogs- what a waste of money- it clogs with the first pass- don't make the same mistake.  The Eureka is very reasonable priced and does a great job.  It's also pretty quiet for a vacuum and my dog who is terrified of the regular vacuum is not bothered by this at all."
2,"This vac is amazing for picking up dog hair. broken wine glasses (who said that? :). leaves that blow into the house. crumbs. party remnants. etc.... I can't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you've just mopped - get this! It's a two minute swish through the house and it's all picked up - it's amazing. My son actually loves it because it's 'just his size' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well. if you insist! :)  I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you're taller then 5&#34;5' you will be scrunching yourself to use this. Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg. should man up and make it up to par."
2,"If you've never tried a stick vac. I highly recommend them.  Super great for quick pick-ups or a run-thru when company is coming.  I have owned several stick vacs over the years but this one tops them all.  The extra battery comes in handy and the clear top makes it easy to see when the brush needs cleaned.  Hang this near your mess area and make clean up quick and life simple.  It does a great job on hard surface flooring or carpeting."
2,"First- I love this light weight vac but it does have a couple of cons that lowered the rating.Con 1- has a hard time picking up little leaves or kitty fur ( which seems to tangle up the rollers easily..)con2. Do NOT buy unless you get two batteries. I have tried everything but the battery life is not anywhere as described and if I hadn't received a second battery I probably would have returned this item.The pro is it does still pick up other stuff pretty well and its so light weight .UPDATE:Increased the star rating due to excellent customer support from Eureka direct.  Notified them of the charging issues and they were awesome and provided the type of customer service that we rarely see anymore.  Hoping a new charging unit and batteries will improve the use time  but regardless.. customer serviced  from Eureka has me believing that if I ever have more problems. they stand behind their product"
2,"I have birds. so before getting this stick vacuum. I was sweeping my carpet area every night around their cages. This vacuum works beautifully. and picks up things very well. It's not a &#34;suction&#34; type &#34;vacuum&#34;. but it does a great job mimicking one. The other great thing is this comes with TWO batteries. so you are never without power.  I had a stick vacuum years ago (different brand). and it only had one battery. so if the battery died before finishing. you were screwed. and had to recharge.  With this. if your power dies out. you have another one waiting. and you continue on.  I can vacuum my living room area. the hall. etc.. maybe three nights before it starts to sound low. So it has a good longevity to the battery. Again. I love this thing! I'm so happy I bought this!"
2,"I bought this to clean up the bits of cat litter my cat tracks onto the bathroom floor  when he jumps out of his litter box.  For this it works stupendously.  I haven't tried it on carpet or as a hand-held. but it seems to be durable and have plenty of suction power. and it has brushes you can turn on for use on carpet.  The extra battery pack is a bonus. tho' I haven't run down the first battery pack yet.  The battery seems to last a long time."
2,"I love everything about this vacuum. The mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery. I can do the upstairs and downstairs in a small home one one of the batteries. Really lightweight - easy to pull out and use. I hate traditional vacuum cleaners because of the noise. but this is really quiet and light.It is powerful enough for hardwood floors and wool rugs. I have a shop vac. so if anything major were to happen. it's there. You'd really be better off with a shop vac than a regular vacuum if something major were to happen anyway. Between the two vacs. it's perfect.It's so lightweight. carrying it up and down the stairs is nothing. but if you have the mounting space and a few extra bucks. you might want to pick up a couple of these."
2,"I'll start by saying that I think we may have received a faulty unit. The canister/filter didn't sit right when clicked into place. which may have been affecting the suction power. We ended up returning it.That said. I still would have probably returned this vac even if it wasn't faulty. The reason being. there are much higher-quality vacs available for not a lot more money. We ended up with an Electrolux Ergorapido. which is so much better made in comparison (there is no comparison. really.)Plus. the &#34;handheld&#34; function of this vac is a joke - all you do is remove the &#34;stick&#34; handle. so the head of the vac when in handheld mode is the same huge head as when it is in upright mode. Most other dual-mode models have a removable &#34;dust buster&#34; style vac with a smaller head for nooks and crannies. Not this Eureka!"
2,"I had trepidations about the power of this device. especially since it had a carpet brush.  I thought. as battery powered.at first. something has to give as a tradeoff.....either power or run-time.  Well. all worries came to ease after it's initial charge of 16-hours.  This broom is a little powerhouse.  It is perfect for our use. which is. to pick up stray cat litter.  It not only achieves this. but also serves to pick up crumbs or just about any small items from a hardwood or low-pile carpeted floor.  Run-time is fabulous.  It has run for more than fifteen minutes. with no degradation of power. on the initial battery.  if one has to sweep longer than this. of course. the battery can be changed with the charged one in less than ten-seconds.  Highly recommend."
2,"This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I bought the last one several years ago and it is still running strong.  I wanted a second one to keep upstairs.  This little Quick Up is exactly as advertised. What a time saver.  It is  light and weight has considerable suction for a cordless.  It is a little Go To machine and I think anyone would be glad they purchased it.  This would be a great gift I think anyone would be delighted to receive.change"
2,"this is my 3rd Eureka Quick Pick Up cordless sweeper. They are great for picking up cat and dog hair and light floor cleaning. I use it daily as I have 2 inside cats.. I would not recommend it for heavy duty carpet cleaning as it is not powerful enough to do a thorough job.It's easy to clean the filter cup but is a little dirty to do so. Just empty the filter cup. rinse it out and the container and allow it to dry before placing on the sweeper.I am pleased it has an extra battery. The previous two did not.If you want a light weight easy to use cordless sweeper. you won't be disappointed"
2,"I'm surprised at the power this little cordless has! It picks up the dirt. dog hair and even little pebbles. A single battery lasts a long time. and with the spare battery ready. I can actually keep my place easily quick-swept. (I'm more a gardener. not a cleaner. so if it's not easy it probably won't happen.) Some cons: the filter case is a little difficult to remove. it would be nice if the 'on' button was up on the handle instead of down on the base. and although the stick comes off for stair cleaning. it doesn't have a 'Dust Buster-like' snout like. say the Electrolux Pronto (which doesn't have the same power). It does clean so well. I'd recommend getting a spare filter or two (they're cheap) so you can rinse one out and have another ready. I'm so glad I got this!"
2,"I was totally amazed to find out this uses NiCad batteries that suffer from battery memory and are horrid.  I had to call Eureka and get new batteries sent. the first customer service agent was horrible and made me call back 24 hours later in the event the batteries suddenly started to work.  NiCad batteries are horrible.  The Vac itself is great. but the batteries make it not worth owning.Among rechargeable battery technologies. NiCad rapidly lost market share in the 1990's. to NiMH and Li-ion batteries; market share dropped by 80% for good reason.  With the battery technology today there is no reason Eureka should have used them except to be cheap."
2,"We retired in Florida and about half of our flooring is tile.  We needed a stick vacuum that would properly sweep the tile floor so we could then steam clean it with another device.  It's quick and easy to use and it weighs very little.  When done. we put it on the charger and it is ready for the next time we have a need for it.  It does take about 16 hours to fully charge the batteries. but it's not really  a problem. since we don't use it every day.  The extra battery should come in handy over time. since all batteries lose their ability to hold a charge.  I suspect that it will take a year or two (or more) before we have to buy a new battery. which is available for purchase through Eureka.  This cordless stick vacuum is exactly what we needed and it was a good purchase."
2,"It is so easy to use. I can stand in one spot and vacuum a large area at one time.  Having two batteries is great. as the one in it (not in the charging holder) goes down quickly. but the back-up finishes my house.  Three problems:  1.  There's a screw on the side between the handle and the bottom that won't stay screwed in.  2.  The bristles have to be checked every time to clean it. with my  shoulder-length hair.  3.  The dust holder just barely stays on the unit; the button that holds it in place barely fits right.It was real easy to put together from the box.But it picks up great and fast and easy. and always amazes me that I can make such a mess to fill the filter!"
2,"The biggest problem in cleaning spots and stains out of furniture and area rugs is lugging around a heavy piece of equipment. This Hoover is small enough to carry with ease and fills simply from the top. It even has a  built in mechanism so it can't overflow. I liked its performance overall  and found it as good. if not better then other household machines. Of  course it seems to work best with the cleaner it came with but since it's  an economical product that isn't a problem either. The best feature it has  is two separate tanks which means you won't end up cleaning your sofa with  dirty water. Overall this product is a good investment and pasys for itself  in one use."
2,"With a one year old and two year old around the house. there is no end of messes. spills. leaking diapers.etc. I've used this to clean spoiled milk out of the bottom of our truck. clean up poopie off the carpet. scrub juice off the living room floor and it does a MAGNIFICENT job!! i would buy it a hundred times over. I highly recommend it for small jobs that don't require professional cleaning. It'll definately get you through and do a better than expected job"
2,"No assembly and ready to go out of box.  2 ounce of cleaner and 1/2 gallon hot water to fill the unit through a convenient fill hole.  Unit does not have to be disassembled to empty. a convenient drain spout.After first use. waste water came out black. and an immediate elimination of pet odor in the stairway.Small size and light weight make it idea for immediate spill clean ups.Unit is built top heavy with a large handle. this balances the weight when solution is in the unit.Cord could be longer and retractable."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
2,"Just received my Steamvac Jr. today and had pet stains waiting to be cleaned.  After they'd been around for a few weeks this little device didn't hold back the cleaning power.  Suction is awesome and I was so impressed I started to find things I wanted to clean...couch pillows. etc.  I just couldn't stop!  I'd recommend to anyone who's considering a handy. powerful tool of this nature.  (One note of caution...I didn't have the handles locked down all the way...my fault...and when lifting it off the counter after filling it up. it all hit the floor!!  Be aware of TWO locks. not one...)  It does come with a small bottle of cleaning agent which worked just fine but I purchased one separately anyway.  Enjoy!"
2,"It's does not vac at all.  I am going to get a canister vac like my friends from Eurica. they worked great.  Uprights are always too loud and does not clean well.  My only good vac was the upright that's cordless.  It does not clean very well. but does the everyday job of picking up dirt.  My ex-wife got it and still using it.  I need to get one.  Wasted hundreds on Hoover and Dirt Devil's upright too.  Purchase 3 Hoover in my life time and are not happy.  3 strikes. your out Hoover.  I'll get a Eureka canister vac for sure."
2,"Because of the many favorable reviews I bought this little vac last week.  I also ordered the Advanced Deep Cleaner with protector and I was AMAZED with the results. I've had a beige sofa bed that was dangerously close to be thrown away like garbage after several years of all types of kid abuse. My sofa looks brand new. smells great and it's soft and fluffy.The machine is noisy. but it's not as bad as I expected. The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it. The brush washed away even old ink stains (I soaked them in alcohol for a few minutes before cleaning)Thanks to this little wonder is cheap. easy to use and very effective."
2,"I purchased this timer to replace an earlier version of the same timer that stopped working.  I started out looking for a different brand. but this one was the lowest cost option.The pros:+  Low cost + free Amazon shipping!+  Easy installation & the dial plate fits over the existing switch opening.+  Easy to operate. with the exception noted below.+  Quiet operation... the fan noise is louder.The cons:-  No manual off?  It's odd they removed the manual off feature that we got used to on the earlier version of this timer.-  The knob is a bear to push on & just as difficult to remove!  I suggest installing & removing the knob a few times to loosen it up. before installing the timer.&#9658; Update - January 9. 2014This timer has been working perfectly since we installed it.  We still miss the manual off feature. :("
2,"Easy to install.  Did it myself - female with VERY limited electrical experience but I am good with tools.It works.  We haven't' had it that long so I can't speak to longevity but it is currently doing what it's supposed to be doing.  It's installed in our main bathroom and it gets a lot of use.Directions were very easy to follow and it looks ok when installed. I mean it looks exactly like the picture. nothing fancy or especially decorative.We bought 3 more for other fans."
2,"I bought 4 of these units from Home Depot in 2005 while building a new home; I paid 15 bucks each.  I use them to automatically shut-off three bathroom fans and a laundry room fan (Broan-NuTone QTREN080 80 CFM. 0.8 Sones. Energy Star Fan).  The timer instructions and face plate say to turn the nob passed 10 minutes (at least). which I do.  They still work great after 6 years.They were easy to install.  And they shut-off the fans consistently.  No complaints.  I would purchase one of these again. if it ever failed."
2,"I have been using this timer for about 5 years and just purchased 3 more at the request of neighbors who wanted one for their apartments.  Mine is used to time the hot water heater for my daily shower and has more than paid for itself in savings on the electricity bill.  Previously it was necessary to manually turn on and off the heater and invariably  it remained on longer than necessary. to the detriment of my electricity bill.  The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability.  I realize that nothing last forever. but after 5 years of daily use mine shows no sign of advancing age.Timers are also available for shorter periods. but I see no benefit in buying one of them.  This timer gives me the option of a full hour. but also permits running the timer for any period less than that.If you need a timer. this is a very good choice."
2,"Strong. stable. stackable. 'nestable' - these boxes have it all... except labels.  Would be nice if Akro included a few labels for the front... they do. but they want you to pay for them. so I'll just cut out some card stock.  These also can mount to the Akro wall-system which is nice. and may be the way I build my next garage work bench.  Currently they're sitting on the bench stacked 3 high.  I liked them so much I placed a second order!"
2,"Quick and easy setup -- no installation required. even though it comes with screws. Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary. At long last. i finally have my multitude of brooms/mops/swiffers/dusters/dust pans OFF the floor and out of the way every time i open the closet door. A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality. nice and sturdy. I like that it is white so blends in with my white door. Highly reccommend."
2,"I live in an apartment. so I wanted something that I could hang over the door instead of drilling/nailing things into the wall for me to fill later when I move out. It was really hard to find! This comes with the hardware to mount if you want to. which is nice if/when I go somewhere more permanent. but honestly. hanging it over the door is working great. Why drill holes when you don't need to? It was a little difficult getting the bracket attached to the peg part. I ended up using a hammer which caused some of the white paint to come off. but you really can't see it and it doesn't affect function. I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
2,"We purchased these bags for the first time in May 2001.  I installed a bag and thought it worked OK.  (I did not throw the former bags. not Hoover bags. out.)  The next time the bag needed changing the lady who cleans the house (unbeknown to us) installed the bag we had been using previously.  My wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference.  After a very short time my wife said she could smell the dust when the vacuum cleaner was in use.  I changed the bag in our vacuum back to a Hoover bag and the probem was cured.  While not very scientific. it convinced us.  I have thrown the other bags away.Additional Comment:Because of the small particles that are trapped in the bag. I take the vacuum outside to remove the filled bag.  This prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house."
2,"This will be short. it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums. it's OEM. it works. no manufacturing or quality issues. If your vacuum uses this size. I see no reason not to get it. As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run. and it has been running for over a decade. I will get these replacements. Thanks to Amazon for making these so easy to acquire. would have had a hard time locally. otherwise.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
2,"There was a review titled &#34;Didn't Fit&#34; which stated:&#34;Be warned! If you are looking for the &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; bag for a Hoover Wind Tunnel vac. don't assume a &#34;Type Z&#34; bag will fit....it won't!&#34;I don't doubt the reviewer got a product which doesn't fit.  Maybe hoover does weird things.  I double checked. and the previous bags I used were &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; - the last one is still in the vacuum.  I replaced that one with this Type Z - fit just fine.  So. I'm not sure what happened with the poor fellow which got ones which didn't fit. but worked just fine for me.It's the genuine hoover product. not the knockoffs sold on here as well.  I figured - why bother saving fifty cents a bag or whatever. when these bags last months.  Not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly."
2,"Awesome pick up power for pet hair.  Does an excellent job cleaning carpets.  I would have given it 5 stars but it overheated on the 3rd use.  I e-mailed hoover and they said to make sure  all filters are clean. I discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged.  The new routine is to check that filter when dumping the canister. No overheat problems with a clean filter. The Hoover folks said that the motor needs lots of air flow to keep it cool. Really impressed with how much dirt it removes from the carpet."
2,"The belts as such are excellent but the Hoover keeps killing them every few months.  My wife uses it carefully but the belt is so tightly stretched around the pegs it is bound to snap and thats what happens.  There got to be much better design.  I had to buy several belts and keep in stock but now I am really fed up with the above Hoover vacuum about this!  I have an older Hoover which has been working since 1988 without a hitch. really.  They do not make things like that any more!!!!!"
2,"I bought this vacuum cleaner belt because I do not need it. Have you ever needed a vacuum cleaner belt? Have you ever needed one IN A HURRY? I had a Kenmore that was the best carpet vacuum I have ever seen. but the belt broke. I didn't have another. I put off looking for one. I moved to an apartment with all wood floors and discarded the Kenmore. Now I have area rugs and a Hoover that just isn't as nice and I can't find bags for it anywhere but Amazon. So I bought the bags here. and the belt too because it was inexpensive and I have bad memories of lacking the vacuum cleaner belt. So now I have this Hoover that I hate too. And if it breaks its belt. I have one on hand so I can go on hating this vacuum cleaner for ever. I even ordered a new hose for it."
2,"I have the Hoover Windtunnel Max vacuum cleaner and these belts fit. Buy them in advance. because my vacuum cleaner picked up a blanket and I pulled it out when the vacuum cleaner was still on. You are supposed to turn off the vacuum cleaner. then pull out the blanket. Well. that was one of the first times I vacuumed with my Hoover and it ruined the belt. and I needed a replacement right there on the spot. I had one. because I went and bought this 2-pack along with my Hoover. A good practice."
2,"For some strange reason. I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep if this fan isn't on.  It doesn't matter if it's snowing outside. this fan has to be on.I have been using it for 2 years and it still works great.  I rarely use the high setting because I have a small room. but the low setting is great for sleeping because it isn't very loud.My only complaint. as will ALL fans that I've owned. are that they get dusty rather quickly and are difficult to clean.  You have to unscrew the plastic screens. wipe the fan blade. hose down the screens. and screw them pack on."
2,"i have for over two years the lasko box fan that i use in bedroom and it works very well.but being an idiot when i came to amazon to order another one i was too lazy to look up my old order and ordered this one becuse 'it looks the same'.  its not.  the 3723 model from two years ago is fabulous.. really cools a mid size room.  this newer model you have to be within 2 feet to even feel any aire.  buy the 3723http://www.amazon.com/Lasko-20-Inch-Premium-Box-3-SPEED/dp/B000HHJ2I2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1344856518&sr;=8-1&keywords;=lasko+3723"
2,"inexpensive fan. works just fine. i bought this for white noise when i sleep. and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine. moves air too. but since that is not what i use it for. i can not speak for it's abilities at that task.side note. the fan came packed only in it's original box. and the first one was cracked and broken. i sent it back. got another. and. and. and... the second one was broken also. it didn't affect the fan really. so i called amazon. got a 10 dollar credit. and kept it. they said they would be flagging the company. whatever that means. never a problem with returns etc at amazon. but since this is a review of the product. not the packaging. there is no star reduction."
2,"Nice to see Made in the USA on the outside of the Lasko 20' box the fan arrived in!Delivery was before scheduled and caught me and my two cats by suprize! Cats have nice new box to play with and I have great smooth operating and quiet cooling Lasko 20' box fan just the right size for my apartment. If you run it on the highest speed naturally it is a little louder. This fan delivers the goods.goods in this case being circulating cool air. Appreciate the prompt delivery also. You may wonder why the early review since having the fan only a couple hours.well the reason is I trust Lasko for a good product since my previous fan was a Lasko I have used for the last 10 years! Motor just wore out after good work for 10 years. Thanks Lasko!"
2,"From now on. I'll always look for a Lasko 3733 when I need to replace a fan. I bought my first one 5 years ago and it ran 24/7 365 days a year. It took 5 years of continuous use before one of the ball bearings wore out. FIVE YEARS of 24/7/365 use! This is a superb fan!This fan is very well balanced. It never wobbles or shakes.This fan is not a quiet as I'd like. but then again. I want perfection and that's not going to happen. It  is quiet enough on the slow setting. and making a fan spin faster does nothing to move air faster (believe it or don't. this is pure physics).Cleaning of this fan is very easy. Simply remove the grill screws. then remove the grills. Then unscrew the blade holder. and pull the blades off the spindle. Wash in hot. soapy water. Replace everything. then turn it on so that it drys itself."
2,"My concern while purchasing this fan was air flow.  Needed a substitute air conditioner for the summertime.  Needed something that could create alot of air movement to suck in the cool air at night. and something that could be aimed at me could cool me off during the day. and this fan achieves that for it's lower price.  Box fans are great. place then in a window and they'll cool a room down in no time.  It is not a quiet fan like the ultra quiets on the market today but it is not as loud as those turbo jet fans.  It has a normal good size fan noise that I don't find irritating.  Other than that. you really don't need the foot attachments.  I placed on the desk. turned on high and it did not fall over.  So. to conclude it is a good solid fan for a reasonable price when your main concern is air flow."
2,"I just bought one of these from Target. This fan is LOUD and makes waaay too much noise.  Even at the lowest setting. this fan sounds like an airplane is getting ready to take off.  I'm not exagerating.This fan is LOUD !!!  Forget about sleeping with this fan on at night.  I am even worried the neighbors can hear it at night.The noise is awful --  and a bad surprise when you need to use it. My parents always had a couple of these box fans around and they never made anywhere near this kind of noise.  The construction is all plastic.  They dont make them like they used to.I dont get it -- the electric fan technology has been around since 1900 --why is the product getting worse and more expensive ???Save your money and buy something else."
2,"This is a fine. basic box fan.  I don't want the fan to be too quiet. and this one isn't.  The low is low. and the high blocks out other noises. I use the fan both to move air into the house and to block out white noise. and this one does the trick.But it's a basic box fan.  There is no thermostat. The three modes are not particularly 'whisper quiet'. as I've heard other box fans quieter and less powerful.There's a knob on the top with three speeds and two plastic feet to help keep it from falling over.That's all.Which is exactly what I needed. for about the cheapest price I could find here on Amazon.It's just not really what the description notes."
2,"Mine arrived crushed because there's no package padding (should be double boxed).  I fixed it myself because I didn't want to return it. by bending it back into shape (it's sort of flimsy. so it wasn't hard).  But. it's too loud for the bedroom even on low.  And. it smells of an oil/electrical smell when it is turned on. yuck.  I have it turned on outside to try to work out the smell (no. it's not rubbing or smoking or anything).I'm trying to replace a Holmes box fan that burnt out after years of use.  The Holmes was extremely quiet on low. and had the added benefit of a rotatable angled vent that could blow diagonally from the window into the room at the side.  Sadly I can't find a direct replacement for my old fan. and this one isn't going to fit the bill."
2,"Our air conditioning went out on the hottest day of the year so far. So we bought a few fans so we could survive until we could get someone to fix the problem. This fan is good for putting in front of a window to draw in cool air. It is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler. As far as this having 3 quiet speeds I'd have to say that is not quite accurate. It is not a silent fan as it does make some noise. But for the price it does a good job. One thing however is that this fan scares my cats. It might take some time for your animals to get used to the noise.~The Rebecca Review"
2,"I love this fan. We bought it years ago and have never had a problem with it. It's pretty simple to figure out. It has three settings: High. medium. low. This is great to put in a window to circulate some fresh air. It runs pretty quietly on the low and medium settings but can get a little loud on high (which is kind of expected).Overall. this is a purchase I have not regretted. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a durable fan. You could probably find it a lot cheaper in a local store. I got mine at Dollar General."
2,"For years. hubby and I have bought Lasko fans to keep in our bedroom.  This is our third one.We use it to keep the air circulating and for the white noise to help me sleep.None of the three that we've owned have had any whining. squeaking. rattling or weird noises.  Just a nice. smooth hum.It does blow hard.The first one died because I let it get too dusty.  The second one lasted for 7 years and I only replaced it because my son needed a fan and I wanted a shiny new one for myself."
2,"I have been sleeping with a box fan in my bedroom  year round for many. many years and have owned several different models but this one tops them all. I can turn up my thermostat in the summer and still stay cool and comfy. in the winter it helps  circulate the warm air in the house. I have a teenage son at home and when he has friends who sleep over they can be a bit noisy sometimes. However. with my Lasko fan turned on the number 2 setting I don't hear them and my son's bedroom is right across the hall from mine. This being said. if you are looking for a quiet fan then I suggest you buy another brand. However. if you want to lower your electric bill and block out noise then this is the one to buy. You can't go wrong with this Lesko!! I reccomend it highly!"
2,"I. like many people. have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep. I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted. I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new. I use mine and my son uses his. every night on low when we sleep. All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be. According to my kill-a-watt. this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low. You can calculate more from there if you would like. My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually. The only problem is like all my other fans. the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago. I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home."
2,"I have had my WM 6qt for 11 months. The ice cream was great but the motor has stopped working. BE AWARE THAT AMAZON only warranties this product for 30 days. The manufactures warranty for the motor is one year. I now have to go to the hassle of contacting White Mountain and securing service for a product that they did not sell to me. I anticipate issues. For a unit that cost this much the seller should back it for the indicated periods.White Mt was very easy to deal with and did replace the motor. I only gope is that it last longer. Great Ice Cream."
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
2,"This is the real thing! I have tried other ice cream makers and this thing worked flawlessly out of the box and makes real ice cream even in a hot and humid environment with ambient temperatures of about 33 degrees Celsius and  85% humidity in a RESTAURANT kitchen and I have been using this everyday to make at least 2 or 3 batches everyday!Would definitely recommend it. A durable item that holds up in today's disposable times. A bit on the loud side as in other reviews but in a restaurant kitchen. who cares as long as it does the job reliably!"
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
2,"I didn't fully realize how nice this peeler is until I was at my mother's over Christmas and tried to use two of hers.  They were slippery. dull. and they HURT to use!  I had never understood that one peeler really could be better than another before that.This peeler is comfortable to hold. even at the end of a big job like peeling apples for a pie or potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner. It is sharp. so you don't have to use a lot of pressure. which also helps decrease hand fatigue.  All-in-all. a good product.** Update 8/18/11: I'm back to purchase two of these as stocking stuffers for my mother. No excuses -- now she can throw out those peelers that have been hanging around since I was a kid. . ."
2,"I love this peeler!  I had one just like it for many years (until I somehow lost it!) and it worked perfectly EVERY time.  I couldn't remember where I bought it and couldn't find another one in any stores - until I finally looked on Amazon.  Thank you. Amazon!  Not only is the gripper handle perfect. the blade works as it should.  I purchased a couple other peelers during my quest and I was very disappointed.  Their blades kept slipping over the vegetables without cutting.  Very frustrating.  I even tried a kitchen Aid brand and hated it.  So save yourself the frustration and the tired hands and just buy this one!"
2,"As with all OXO Good Grips products. the handle on this peeler is great.  The blade. however. is less than 2 inches long. making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes. though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers.  Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating. rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers.  In short. this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."
2,"Just like the last post. We had one of these for years. Ours too suddenly disappeared without a trace!  How wierd!Anyway. I went to my local walmart and they did not have this same model. so i settled for what they had in stock. Needless to say. I returned that piece of junk the next day. got a refund. And found one of these at another local store!  I couldnt believe what i had taken for granted in this potato peeler!It is still very sharp after years of use. the handle is very comfortable and the swivel on the blade works perfectly.I dont know what the diff is between this model and the $12 model also made by Oxo. but this one is fantastic!You will get years of use out of this peeler. untill maybe the aliens decide to snatch yours too!"
2,"I've long been a fan of OXO utensils but I didn't think there was a good are bad when it came to peelers. I was wrong. I cook quite a bit and had used a peeler recently at my brother's house. When I got this one and used it. it was like night and day. It is surprisingly effective in peeling as if it were super sharp. but I've run it into my hand on accident a couple times and never been cut. There's something about the design of the blade that makes it pretty safe to use and still really quick at peeling. It also comes with a nifty plastic blade cover that I use to protect the blade from dulling in my utensil drawer. Nice little feature."
2,"If you're not a cook. then you probably won't have a use for this. but anyone in the search of a superior vegetable peeler. look no further. I've had mine for over two years. and it's working as well as the day I purchased it. It doesn't dull. it peels efficiently. it's safe. light. easy to handle. easy to clean. and doesn't rust. It works well with potatoes. carrots. cucumbers. and zucchinis. I've never tried chocolate. though. It's crazily cheap that you should definitely give this product a try. I promise you won't be disappointed."
2,"Peeling has never been more fun!  I love this peeler. It is super easy to peel any kind of fruit I want. I'll never go back to the regular type of peelers or God-forbid dangerous knives. I like peeling potatoes. apples. and carrots.  Sometimes. I buy root vegetables just so I can peel them.  This peeler is ergonomically comfortable. I can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands. (I wear size XS gloves.)  It's not hard to clean either. I just rinse and wipe. along the grain. using a sponge. That does the trick.  I've had this for months and so far no visible grime has built up on it.  It is rust free as the day I bought it.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I am recommending it to you."
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
2,"I'll be honest; I don't get much exposure to a great variety of vegetable peelers. but I would hazard a guess that this is one of the best.I bought this based on the other good Amazon reviews and have not regretted it. Its sharp and very efficiently does its job.My sister came over for Christmas and after using it on a few dozen vegetables was so impressed that she went out the next day to find one of her own. I have a reputation in my family for buying the best of the best. no matter the cost. so she was very surprised to find this peeler was so cheap.Buy it. it just works."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
2,"Bought for 3rd time in November 2012.  Due to misadventures in moving we have had to buy this exact product 3 times.  The grip stays in hand with no slipping even if hand gets wet while using.  Peels excellent with little pressure.  My gal friend has rheumatoid arthritis and this is the only style she can use.  Got stupid once and bought the Kitchen Aid red colored one just because of the color and regretted on 1st use - handle was uncomfortable. slippery. and blades would not peel properly.  The OXO is easy to use. easy to clean. very reliable product and company.  Amazon price slightly better than any other store we researched."
2,"Like many of the &quot;Good Grips&quot; products. it's really astounding how much better this peeler is than &quot;traditional&quot; peelers (you know. the all-metal. slightly rusty thing that had been in your utensil drawer since you bought at at the supermarket when you were stocking the kitchen for your first apartment).  This inexpensive gadget produces much better results. much faster and more comfortably. than any other peeler I've ever used.  It works equally well on potatos. carrots. apples. etc.  It's cheap ($5-$6 for an essential kitchen tool you'll own for years) and works great; why in the world wouldn't you buy it?  If you cook and you don't own one. stop reading and buy one now.  It's a no-brainer."
2,"I purchased the OXO Good Grips Peeler back in 2000 and I have been using it ever since with no problems whatsoever. I originally bought it to replace the peeler that came in my Culinary School tool kit. That peeler had broken after only a month of use. But I have used the OXO peeler ever since. going on 5 years now. It feels great in my hands and peels potatoes. carrots and other vegetables perfectly. While I was in school my classmates were constantly borrowing this from me and asking me where I bought it. Even one of my Chef instructors loved it and would use it from time to time. If this peeler were to ever break on me. which it has shown no signs of doing. I would not hesitate to buy another OXO."
2,"Yup. this is a great peeler.  The handle is sturdy and feels good in the hand.  The 'grips' help avoid slippage with your wet. kitchen hands.  Swivel action helps when peeling uneven surfaces (think potatoes).  The guard over the top of the blade aids in gripping and safety.The peeler I had before this was some cheap little thing I got at the grocery store.  It's definitely worth a few extra bucks to get a real peeler.  Especially if you love sweet potato mash as much as I do!"
2,"This is the best peeler I have used!  I have one and have given them as gifts numerous times. The grip is comfortable. the peeling action is smooth and quick and it just is a joy to use.  What more could you want? My wife  has carpal tunnel and loves the whole line of OXO products. but this one is  our favorite. Even my 11 year old daughter begs me to use it when I peel  vegetables.This is the last peeler you'll ever need!"
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
2,"One would be surprised how rare it is to find a peeler that is actually easy to use. The grip has to be just right. the peeling head has to swivel not too much and not too little and its edges have carry just the right amount of sharpness. I went though a number of peelers which I all eventually abandoned in favor of my trusted knife. However. once I got my hands on one these OXO ones. I never used my knife again.Nowadays. that seems you cannot go through a single day without coming across Food Shows. this swivel peeler is a must in every kitchen.RECOMMENDED."
2,"The day I got this peeler. I compared how it peeled side by side with my other swivel potato peeler. just like an infomercial. or something. The size of the pieces that came off when peeled with the new one was incredible. It takes no time at all to peel a potato. whereas I had to spend at least 10 minutes on it before! I'm surprised that most swivel potato peelers don't have any kind of grip on the handle. because after any length of time. holding it can definitely be hard on your hand. It peels carrots equally well. and it makes cooking much more leisurely and fun."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
2,"I purchased this years ago and have loved it from the start... It's so comfortable to hold. works in both directions - peeling away from your hand or towards your hand. We use it on cucumbers. potatoes. and carrots. Takes off just the right amount of peel with each swipe. It has held up fine in the dishwasher and seems to be still sharp enough. probably 15 years after we bought it... LOVE IT and would highly recommend. The lines you see on the sides of the handle are great for gripping and compress as you squeeze them. so even with wet hands. the peeler does not slip!"
2,"I have about 5 different peelers in my drawer. my last favorite one was similar but the cheaper $1.99 version from walmart but they don't have a higher end product like this. However I love the previous one. it came to rusting due to its cheaply made metal I think. So I'm seeking for a better replacement. I do like most of OXO products like can opener. wine opener etc... One thing I didn't like about previous walmart version is that it peel a bit thicker than I want that it take away more than I want just the fruit's shield. This peel was great. peel thinner. exactly as I wanted. But I hope it'll last much longer for its price and brand that doesn't rust out like the other one.Best peeler I ever have. this would probably a good gift for mother's day."
2,"meh.. it's alright...  Does it peel?  Yes.  I've had mine for a few years now and even had them sharpened.  So. how much can there be to a peeler to make a difference enough to say 'oh yeah baby peel baby peel'?  Not this peeler.  In general I like OXO stuff for their grips and that's about it.Rather than just complain.  Allow me to point you to a peeler that has me reeling peels.Messermeister Peeler Trio SetThe Messermeister is a much better peeler in that it requires hardly any effort with the standard peeler.  It comes individually or as a trio pack.  Of the trio the standard and serrated peelers are the most often used.  The julienne peeler not so much but consider it a freebie at this price.  nogo on this oxo."
2,"I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.  And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.  Everything came out nicely and neatly.  All it took was bit of turning and pushing. and then the whole core came out like a beauty!  I just love it!  Plus. it saves so much time.Yes-- the handle/grip is absolutely well designed.  It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all."
2,"Apple corers have always been a pain.  The kind wth the handles that you center over the apple and push down into wedges...those just don't work well.  If the core is off center. you end up with a difficult cut and having to pare away the core from the slices.This Oxo Good Grips Corer is nice.  The trick to using this one is to twist as you push and yo get a much cleaner coring.  I used this and then slice the apples into rings...my kids love it."
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
2,"I absolutely love this corer! It's incredibly easy to use. and the best part is that it doesn't seem to have any sharp edges I can cut myself on. Clutz-approved! Despite lacking sharp edges. it still cuts through an apple very easily and without a lot of force. OXO handles are great. as I have quite a few of their other products in my kitchen. and this has lived up to it's non-slip standard. If you miss getting all the seeds out the first time. no worries! It comes out as easily as it goes in and and you can try again. Just try not to get too crazy with it. or you'll end up with a bunch of apple cylinders and no apple left!"
2,"I have several OXO Good Grips gadgets in my kitchen and I find they are consistently well designed and do the job they are meant to do and do it well. This corer is right up there with the best of the OXO tools. The handle is large and sturdy and helps me get a good grip so I can get the core out with one motion. I have really bad arthritis in my hands so if this tool did not perform well. I'd be looking for a replacement.I find this size takes out just the right amount of core. I tend to buy organic when possible and those apples are generally a little smaller than conventionally grown ones. This corer takes out just enough so the seeds and little tough seed casing is removed without taking too much of the apple flesh.Very pleased with this product and happy to recommend."
2,"Before buying this product. I used an apple corer and divider. I hated using it because I'm petite and it would take me 5 minutes of using all of my strength to core the apple and have it cut into wedges. I am starting to eat healthier and decided to buy this apple corer to see if I liked it better. I love the OXO Good Grips Corer! It takes just seconds to core the apple and the core is easy to remove from the corer. The handle is comfy and easy to grip. Cleaning the corer is also easy. I use this to core small and medium-sized apples and the core comes out completely. However. I do not think the core will come completely out with larger-sized apples because of the size of the head. Overall. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,"I followed the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated in buying this. The corer is so much better than the half circle corer I used growing up. Solid handle is easy to grip and gives you enough torque that it feels almost effortless to use. The hardest part is aiming the thing so it goes through the center of the apple. Also the size of the core extract is a little on the small side for the biggest apples. A little of the core is left in the apple. but for normal store sized apples it works great. Highly recommended!"
2,"This is an easy corer to use. You push down on the stem end and punch out the core of the apple. Peel first or not. Sometimes you get a wonky apple and the core misses a few seeds but that can be handled when you quarter the apple (a bit of trimming with the paring knife.) This is fast. I used to have one of those slice-and-core type corers but this is so much better. It's more compact in the tool drawer and it works a lot better. It's actually faster and cleaner to use the paring knife to cut the apple wedges if that's what you want.The handle is nice and grippy and thick for a good grip as you push it into the apple. and the blade is sharpe enough to easy penetrate the fruit and push out the core. I use this all the time."
2,"I bought this originally to core and fill cupcakes. This tool is great for this. You can remove the core of a cupcake and the cake will stick to the inside of the corer and easily pull out of the cupcake. Then you can use your finger to push the core out of the corer. Then fill your cupcake (with marshmallow cream. or cherry filling. so many yummy options). We also have used it to core cucumbers (and fill with herbed cream cheese). Of course coring apples is easy too. One thing I like is that while the tool isn't exceptionally sharp. with a bit of pressure it easily cores items. I like that it's not a super sharp tool. but rather serated to cut through items."
2,"I've seen different products for apples and onions that look like they do the same thing.  I needed something for both and this fits the bill.I roast and smoke apples and onions both (not together...) in the grill and in the smoker all the time.  Some of my more popular and requested items actually. so I have a need for this in more than just one way.To core your apple or onion. if it doesn't simply push straight through. all you have to do is twist it slighly back and forth while pressing down.  It cuts cleanly and doesn't take out too much either. no real waste to speak of.  For larger items you may need to go through it one more time taking out the extras but for regular or medium-large items this takes everything out in one push.Works perfectly. has a 'good grip' per the name. is very solid and cores easily.  Highly recommended kitchen gadget that will certainly get its uses around my house.-D"
2,"I use this tool every day and love it. It's very well built. simple. functional. easy to use. and only takes a few seconds to clean. What more can you ask for? It's really a time saver and makes eating apples more enjoyable because you don't have to deal with the seeds. It also cores pears.To use it all you do is line up the center of the apple. apply a little pressure while turning the handle slightly and it takes out the core with very little effort. If you love apples and pears. this is a must have tool."
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
2,"This bottle/can opener feels just like the OXO Good Grips vegetable peeler.  Its black. rubberized grip has a section of 'gills' that molds to your grip for better control.  When you're done. just pop it in the dishwasher.  The only drawback is that with long term use. the 'gills' sometimes break off.  It took years for that to happen to mine (only one section).This is hardly an elegant device. but it works well and is perfect for everyday and outdoor use.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
2,"I picked up a OXO Y-peeler. like the above model. except with a red inlay on whim in Krogers. about.. 5 to 6 years ago? I still have it and it works great! Tried to take good care of it.This peeler is perfect if you have Big hands. and want a functional peeler. and want to peel manually like nobodies business. Used to use a peeler. that wasn't a Y shape. but was just straight with a long U shaped point blade. My hand cramped up so bad all the time! And I'm a young guy. So I got this and have never looked back.I absolutely love this kitchen tool!Anyways. this will be a good investment when peeling potatoes or carrots. Haven't really used it on anything else."
2,"Switching from vertical to horizontal took a little getting used to. but I love this peeler. I had a similar one when I first married but lost it in a move or something early on. I'd thought several times I'd get another. because I did like it. but didn't get around to doing that until the old wooden vertical one finally wore out. I really like it. I especially like the little scoop on the side that lets you scoop out potato eyes while you're peeling. Nice feature. Comfortable to grip. like all OXO products."
2,"I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to &#34;Y&#34; peelers on another website. That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available. I was delighted to find OXO made one. OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle. With my other peeler. my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes. I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler. The &#34;Y&#34; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control. The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp. I'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools."
2,"does exactly what it is supposed to do. as a child i watched my grandmother use the old fashioned peeler. she could and did peel apples do the skin came off in one long  sheet. she wasn't showing off. she just had the mastery of the tool. when i needed a peeler. i automatically went with the same old fashioned peeler. i'm not sure when i finally had the chance to use one of these &#34;european&#34; peelers. they are perfect. they do exactly what a peeler is supposed to do. peel stuff quickly and easily. with emphasis on easy."
2,"I love this peeler! I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash. but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes. turnips. carrots. etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition. but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area. most stores carry only the swivel version."
2,"I got both this peeler and the OXO Pro Y Peeler. This is a very good peeler. It is much better than my old Zyliss peeler which I used to think is a great peeler compared to the nobrands I used before. HOWEVER. After using the OXO Pro series - this does not compare. I would therefore give it 4.5 if I could and not 5. (Or I should give the Pro Peeler a 6...) Bottom line - it's a good peeler. and does the job for the price. BUT - If you can spare the extra few bucks. the Pro is just a league of its own."
2,"I have a million peelers. Okay. not a million. but at least 5... and they are all terrible. I was a little skeptical to get this one. because why would this one be any different. Well. my friend brought hers over to my house when we were preparing food for a friend's party. Amazing. First of all. the grip is so comfortable! Fits my hands perfectly and doesn't hurt my hand (as much) when peeling a thousand potatoes... or carrots... or cucumbers. Second. one slice and the peel is gone! No going over the same  spot seven times! I love it so much. I went out and got my own. and those other five peelers went straight to the garbage."
2,"The handle sure is comfortable. just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber. it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip. the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid. non-damaging material."
2,"I've gone through two of these and won't purchase another.  The first one broke after using it a three or four times. but since I like Oxo products in general. I assumed it just a fluke. The second one I simply threw away. As other reviewers have pointed out. it uses tiny. metal teeth to grip the lid. which slip and could conceivably cause injury. It was worthless. so I'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a  spoon.  Works better than Oxo. that's for sure."
2,"This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower!  I was sick of using those rubber pads; not only did they tear easily. but also they didn't work very well.  So far. OXO's version has been a big improvement:  the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids. and with a simple twist. the lid is off cleanly and neatly.  I have found that the unit can sometimes slip. especially with a very small lid. but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface. you should have mostly success. as I have."
2,"Bought this six years ago to use instead of the under-cabinet one that was already installed in my kitchen. The under-cabinet one was better at unscrewing a lid. but occasionally the jar would slip out of the vice and my hand would get pinched.  Well. this OXO opener proved to be a disaster in every way. Like other reviewers noted. it doesn't secure well enough to the lid. slips off the lid. and hurts your hand when it gets slammed into the jar. I'm surprised no one has sued the company for manufacturing this awkward. uncomfortable. dangerous product."
2,"I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed.  It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble.  The opening is way too big to accomplish that so. back it went to the supermarket.  I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't. I am rating this only one star."
2,"This scoop works great. I first tried the pointed ice cream scoop and  couldn't use it. I have problems with my wrists. I have used other Oxo  tools and love them. so I tried again with this scoop. It works so well it  seems to be designed with me in mind. It is easy to dip out even the  hardest ice cream now and the bail pops the ice cream out of the scoop  --clean as a whistle. You can wash it in the dishwasher too."
2,"The metal scraper loop that expels the ice cream is unbelievably flimsy and very tenuously attached on both ends. Although it worked well as a muffin disher. it deformed and popped out the first time I tried to scoop ice cream from a batch I made that was frozen just a bit over soft serve (I would never use ANY sweeper scoop - even well-made ones like theNorpro 3-Tablespoon Stainless Steel Scoop- to dish ice cream any harder than that). Waste of money. Look elsewhere.And for dishing ice cream only. of any degree of hardness. try theZeroll Original 3-Ounce Aluminum Ice Cream Scoop."
2,"I really didn't expect much from this scoop except a fatter grip. which I need due to a hand injury. I had no great expectations - a scoop is a scoop. right? Well. not in this case. The scoop is well balanced and light weight. and easy to grip. It produces nice. even servings of ice cream instead of clunky chunks. I can get great leverage. Somehow this tool makes scooping even the hardest ice cream easier. and I never need to run it under water to soften the ice cream.  Maybe it's the pointed but not sharp leading edge of the scoop that cuts right into the ice cream. Maybe it's the leverage you get from the thick. non-slip grip. I'm just happy it makes serving ice cream effortless."
2,"I was so happy to finally find an ice cream scoop that doesn't break or bend awkwardly after only a few uses. This scoop is very sturdy with a big comfortable handle for those of us with big hands. I like the shape of the scoop itself. it's a little sharper and flatter and really does a nice job digging into the ice cream. Be careful though because this digging can lead to you puncturing the bottom or sides of the container. I would have given this 5 stars but after a month or so these little bumps began to form on the finish of the inside of the scoop. These bumps don't impact the function of the scoop. but they certainly don't look that great."
2,"My son works at a ice cream shop. and when I recieved this ice cream scoop. he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work. Until he actually used it. It looks metal. but feels like it's plastic. When I used it for the first time. I was scooping out very hard ice cream. and it felt like it was going to break. I had to turn it in circles to get anything. I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one. At least I know it won't break in my hand."
2,"I've come to expect solid. well-designed products from OXO. and this ice cream scoop did not disappoint me. From the comfortable black rubberized grip to the heavy stainless steel scooper. it's quality quality quality. I tried it on hard ice cream. and it does scoop it well...but don't expect to get by with no elbow grease. Hard ice cream is hard to scoop! The angled edges of this scoop are helpful in breaking the surface. and the narrowed/pointed end works great for getting into the corners of ice cream boxes.I like the black-and-stainless color. too. which works well with the rest of my kitchen. And. going by my usual 'what else can I use this for' approach to anything I buy. I think this would be good as a transplanting tool or. in a pinch. even a melon baller."
2,"OXO makes nice kitchen products that are reasonably priced and are of a high quality.  This ice cream scooper is another example of this and is a nice purchase.  The primary distinction between this and your average scooper is that this one has pointed edges.  This makes it easy to get the ice cream out of the box. especially when it's hard.  It also helps with getting to ice cream out of the corners.  My only con of this scooper is that due to the shape. you won't be able to get perfect round balls of ice cream.  Of course. that is a minor issue and shouldn't be a reason to avoid buying it."
2,"The good is the handle.  It is very comfortable to hold and to use.  The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff. frozen ice cream.  I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just couldn't compete.  The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand. but it was an effort to achieve results.  I wouldn't say it was any better than average.  The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch.Disclosure:  I have no connection to Tupperware"
2,"This is the worst ice cream scoop ever. The part of the scoop that attaches to the handle is only about 1/4 inch in diameter. It's a total scam; they made it look thicker. by making the part that holds the scoop 4 times as wide. You can't tell by looking at it. because they have cleverly disguised it with the plastic handle. I found out when the handle broke off in my hand. while trying to scoop some hard ice cream. Oxo. you should be ashamed of yourselves for making this piece of junk. which was clearly designed to deceive the consumer. I'll likely never buy an Oxo product again."
2,"This scoop has a comfortable handle and a good shape for attacking hard ice cream straight out of the freezer. The chrome finish is attractive and seems like it would be more durable and dishwasher-safe than the ridiculous (and unnecessary) non-stick finish I have on my other Oxo scoopOXO Good Grips 26481 Nonstick Beak Ice Cream Scoop. I prefer to dip this in water before use (so it will glide through the ice cream). and to wash it by hand afterward. This isn't an all-metal scoop. like theOXO Good Grips Solid Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop. so I'm a little concerned about its longevity."
2,"Good grips utensils have always been one of my favorites because of the large comfortable handles. I already had a good grips ice cream scoop. but got another one so I would always have one ready when i got an ice cream craving. I was surprised when this one arrived to see the shape of the scoop had been improved. now the end has a rather pointed tip. and this is GREAT! it makes scooping into hard ice cream a lot easier. This scoop puts all the others to shame. I it is now the first one I grab when i need to scoop ice cream. I also use it as a serving utensil if I am serving mashed potatoes or foods of similar consistency and it works great. You will like this scoop. there is not a better one around."
2,"My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using.  Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time.  This scoop works so much better. even without running it under hot water first!  The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material. and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me.  i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream.  Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!"
2,"It's been a month and so far. so good. with this OXO ice cream scoop.  The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold.  Also. the handle shows no sign of separating from the metal scoop part. so I'm happy about that. and the shiny finish on the scoop is smooth and blemish-free still.  We're washing it in the dishwasher. so I will update if there are any longevity issues with this ice cream scoop.All in all. if you need an ice cream scoop. this does the job nicely.*Update: February 2012*  It's been 8 months. still looks like new."
2,"This scoop has a nice edge to it that lets the scoop dig down deep no matter how hard your ice cream is.The no-slip grip on the handle is easy to grasp and not nearly as thick as some I have tried.I would of given it the full 5 stars if I could make it scoop out perfect balls of ice cream but either there is a trick to it that I haven't discovered yet or my ice cream is frozen too hard.All things considered. this is a quality item that will get lots of use in most kitchens."
2,"This is a good ice cream scoop if you're just looking for something at a reasonable price and is very comfortable.  I think those are the two biggest advantages of this utensil.  The bad thing is that it's not the most durable.  For the most durable. you'll want to look for a one piece metal scoop.  This one works best if you dip it in hot water first to heat it up and then scoop out your ice cream.  This will make the ice cream a little more easy to handle as the tool can kind of melt it's way through.  Dip it back in the hot water before each scoop.  This tip can be applied to all ice cream scoopers."
2,"I'm a long time fan of Oxo products. but this isn't one of my favorites. Based on an earlier review. I bought this to use with cookie dough as well as ice cream. The dough sticks so badly that I need to use a rubber scraper to get it out (doesn'5t matter if the dough is room temp or cold - I've tried it both ways). Furthermore. after about 6 months of use. the handle seems to not be fitting tightly with the scoop. and feels &quot;wobbly&quot;. It's also not all that easy to get clean. The lever portion is hard to get under and closes so tightly that just tossing it into the dishwasher doesn't do the job. It's going to be replaced - just don't know if it'll be replaced with another type of Oxo scoop or another brand.  I"
2,"My favorite dish brush.  When the price took a big dip I bought several.  They will last a long time too if you don't use it on hot pans and store with bristles up or not resting on anything that flattens them.  Run through the dishwasher monthly or sooner.  The large diameter handle fits my XL hand well.  If the price is around $5 - 7 jump at $10 no way?  But if ten is nothing then go for it.  I have not found anything better."
2,"I've had this dish washing utensil for about 5 months now and have put enough use in with it to give it a solid 5 star review.Unlike sponges or scour pads. this brush does not get old. the bristles stay intact and do not pull out like I've seen with other brushes and it is the perfect size for cleaning both dishes. pots and pans but at the same time being small enough to fit into glasses and mugs in order to clean the bottoms of them as well.Really glad I decided to go with this OXO good grips product based upon reviews which I had seen on Amazon.  I like this brush so much I wish I could give it as a gift to people (without the implications that they need to clean. as I've learned. cleaning devices do NOT make good gifts)!"
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
2,"I had a great little OXO brush with a suction cup that stuck to the side of the sink that finally needed replacing.  Sadly they don't seem to make that kind anymore.  So I replaced that with a longer handled brush and liked the price ($4.50 as an add on item) and the reviews.I wasn't sold on it the first use. but then I started getting more comfortable with the different style. and I like it.I would have liked the bristles a little closer together. but I figure I'll buy another round dish brush if need be.  It's great for glasses and even for scrubbing pans.  There is a soft plastic scraper tip for caked on stuff.I hand wash 75% of my dishes. so I use dish brushes a lot.  This is a good value dish brush and I am quite happy with it.  It's not worth paying $10 - $15 for a perfect brush when this is really good for a lot less."
2,"The bristles are quite firm for a brush of this type but they're spread out.  That's ok IF you use this brush to remove food from utensils prior to placing in dishwasher.If you're trying to clean pans though. this brush won't be perfect.  In that case. consider a brush just meant for that purpose such as this one:Cuisinart Round Head Brush.  Black.I recently discovered the advantage of using both kinds of brushes depending on what I'm doing.  This way. the kitchen brush isn't ruined trying to clean pans and other hard-to-clean items.  The sacrifice is having to keep two brushes handly instead of the simplicity of just one. but I found it better this way."
2,"This item just arrived yesterday. I am so happy that it did. I looked at the 'tired' dishrag being used and quickly disposed of it. My family finds the brush easier to use and 'polishes off' the dish-washing vigils with the dishcloth. Weekly bleachings of the dishcloths eventually wear the rags out. The dish brush replaces the harshness of scrubbing to remove dried or sticky foods from dishes. pots. and pans without damaging them. No more rusty or unraveling scouring pads either. Easy to clean and comfortable in the hand.This brush is sturdy and the bristles appear to be well-rooted in the base. Only time will tell! For now. I am satisfied."
2,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later. and with CONSTANT. REGULAR. FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen. the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most. thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle. not the black/white one shown in the photo. so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
2,"I had just remodeled my kitchen and got a brand new black apron style kitchen sink. Could not bear the thought of buying another $1 brush that would tear up in two week.s like the other two dozen. in the 'use for the outdoor' bin.  I thought I was splurging to by an 'expensive' kitchen brush. but good grief. this thing is still in pristine condition. There has been no problem with bristle breakage. smell. mold. handle wear. etc.  I never imagined it would hold up like it has.  So definitely worth the small investment. Save yourself the aggravation of replacing a brush constantly and go with the quality. I mainly use this for prewashing dishes before they go in the dishwasher. but also can use it on pots and pans. I've not needed to buy an extra one for any other purpose. I do agree that the bristles are widely spaced. but this has not interfered with my daily use of it."
2,"I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs.  I have only had this brush a few days. but find myself using it constantly.  It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal. cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood. and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices.  The brush can be put in the dishwasher. or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes. This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task.  It is definitely a good value for the price."
2,"I have always felt that OXO is hit and miss with quality.  I have tried several of their kitchen brushes over the years and this one is pretty good.  It has a strong handle and I suspect it will last more than 6 months.  At the same time. I'll probably replace it before then for cleanliness purposes. since the head isn't replaceable.  Regardless. it's cheap and does the trick.  Good for general cleaning of dishes. etc. but not for the true elbow grease stuff."
2,"Bought this just to get the 25 dollar free shipping. and am back for another.  This is by far the best dish and mug brush I have ever had (mind you I am not really a kitchen-y type).  Anyway. I've had it a couple months now and am impressed after using it to scrub the rings (that never come off in the dishwasher) off coffee/tea mugs. cleaning pots. etc.  Usually with other brushes the ends of the bristles get 'mashed' looking fairly quickly. but this is holding up well - even after my son cleaned mud. spider webs and other debris off an old army helmet with it - (which is why I am buying another)."
2,"I purchased this brush for the sole purpose of cleaning out my cast iron pans.  The last brush I used was from the dollar store and didn't last very long.  I like that this brush has the tips that branch out at the top. making it easier to clean around the rim of the pans.  I cook everything in cast iron nowadays. and the best way to get out tough residue it to fill the pan half way with water and bring to a slow boil.  from there the brush gets all of the tough stuff out. Then I sent the pan back on the stove for a couple of minutes under heat so the condensation evaporates.  then I spray with oil and let cool so I can store it.  Overall this is a very nice brush for the price.  I think it will last loner than the last based on it's construction."
2,"It was time for a new paring knife...  I do own quite a few.  This is the one for paring apples and most fruit. It feels like an extension of my hand when paring.  The other paring knives clean wax out of candles now.  The professional series works for me.Immediate update. I meant to post this under the 3-1/2 'professional' paring knife.  It's the same price and has a much better blade. I have owned this one and it's great for sliced a sliver of cheese out of the frig for a midnight snack.  Check out the professional one. it's only $6.99.  The 4' one is $14.99...that one I would have to think about.OXO Good Grips Professional 3-1/2-Inch Paring Knife"
2,"I suddenly had a need for more paring knives so I decided to buy four various models on Amazon to try them out.  This is by far my favorite.  They are extremely sharp and the rubberized grip is very comfortable.  When I reach into my drawer I tend to want to grab this knife over the others but have to tell myself to rotate through all of them.  I've had it for over three months now with use almost every three days and so far no sign of any type of oxidation or staining.  I wash it in a dishwasher all the time as well."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
2,"I don't have a complete knife set and was tired of ruining loaves of bread with my dull chefs knife and other basic kitchen knives.  In all honesty the main reason I purchased this particular knife was that it was the cheapest.  Having good luck with other Oxo products previously purchased. I wasn't to hesitant to purchase yet another.  It has a sharp serrated blade and a comfortable handle that have easily handled all of my bakery cutting duties (bread and bagels mostly).  This knife is also nice for heavy skinned fruits. easing through pineapples and cantaloupes.  It has also stood up to the dishwasher rather well.  You will not be sad with this knife and will be happy with the outcome of every cut you make."
2,"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.  A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs. and this knife does just that.  It has the nice 'good Grips' handle and is a good length.  It is nice and sharp and for the price. I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.  It is not the fanciest knife I own. but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.  Good. basic bread knife!"
2,"Cutting bread without a bread knife is futile exercise. This bread knife works well and is very inexpensive. The blade is only about 8 inches. so it is not quite long enough to cut bread from a bread machine if the loaf is placed on its side.  I thought I had to get a longer knife. but then I figured I can stand the bread up so that it is much narrower.  That works. the knife is now long enough to cut very thin slices of bread that has about the same thickness as the Wonder sandwich bread that I used to buy in grocery stores."
2,"We have owned a couple of bread knives.  All were serrated knives. but not all cut bread well.  The OXO (and we love that brand!) is a favorite.  The handle has a good grip... made of a harder rubber or plastic.  It is also a well balanced knife that holds comfortably in both my hand and my wife's hand.The best thing about this knife is that it cuts.  It cuts soft bread. hard bread. bagels. etc.  Like with all good bread knives. you have to let the knife do the cutting and not push down.  This one works like a champ!"
2,"I needed a good bread knife that would easily slice artisan loaves.  After reading the reviews. I purchased this one.  I like the fact that it is sharp. but I wish it was a longer length to handle wider loaves.  And I prefer a knife with more weight to it.  This one is very light weight. so at times the slices are not uniform....one side will be thinner than the other.  It's like the knife is a little hard to control.  However. it cost so little. it was worth trying."
2,"I have recently started making all my own bread and love it.  BUT - I hated cutting it!  I could never get it even and always smushed it.  I started using an electric knife and that worked better but I hate pulling it out every time I need to slice bread.  So. after some researching. I decided I needed a &#34;bread&#34; knife.  I looked at several and decided on this one due to price.  I didn't want to spend much and then it not work.  WOW!  I have used it almost every day since it arrived.  It cuts bread perfectly - straight and doesn't smush it!  I love this knife and now I don't hate cutting bread :)"
2,"I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6&quot; utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy. it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife."
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
2,"I bought a sandwich knife years ago. and loved it so much that I wanted another one. I  bought one of these knives and loved it so much that this is my second one.The rubbery substance the handle is made up gives a really secure grip and makes the knife easy to handle. The edge is serrated and will cut through most things that you'd want to cut with a sandwich knife.The blade can hold a lot of jam. mayonnaise. or cream cheese. and lay down a nice thick layer of what you're spreading. but still lets you put a thinner layer if you want.It's the easiest to use sandwich knife I've ever had."
2,"I LOVE this spreader - I bought one to try it out. despite some negative reviews.  I thought. it's only $5. I'll try it.I haven't had any of the problems that others have stated.  I don't take it apart for cleaning. and I haven't seen any rust spots.  I just throw mine in the dishwasher.After using spreaders from Pampered Chef. I much prefer the Oxo spreader. as it's much stiffer & able to scoop better.  Very useful for peanut butter. cheese spreads. cream cheese. etc.  I like it so much. I'm ordering more."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
2,"This is not a kitchen essential. but I love it.  I only bought it to take advantage of the 4 for 3 promotion. and as it turns out. I use it almost everyday.  I have had it for over a year. and it still looks like new.  I rarely use the dishwasher. so I wash mine by hand.  I probably wouldn't bother putting something like this in the dishwasher anyway.I like to bake. and I use the spreader to spread butter over the dough for cinnamon rolls. spread pizza sauce over pizza dough. and I have used it a couple of times to put the frosting on cupcakes.  What a great tool for 5 bucks!"
2,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered. as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use. peeler away from you normally.  Great control and the blade is sharp as can be. making a carrot easy work.  The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.  Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large. comfortable. and steady."
2,"I bought this set when I first moved into my apartment. as I've been a fan of the Good Grips products for a while now. This set is absolutely indespensible. as I use these tools almost every day.Peeler:  This is wonderful for peeling potatoes. as the easy-to-grip handle and swivel blade help you to comfortably maneuver around bumpy and slippery surfaces.Knife:  Since purchasing the set 4 months ago. my knife has stayed incredibly sharp and is able to cut through everything from crunchy carrots to smooshy tomatoes.Here's why the set didn't get the &quot;5&quot; rating: The pair should be hand washed and *not* put in the dishwasher.  The knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle. Note: This was easy to correct with a Brillo pad and a little elbow grease.However. I don't think you should let this &quot;diswasher drama&quot; sway you from purchasing this set. as the benefits *far* outweigh the limitations."
2,"Meat Tenderizer OXO / B00004OCJJIt always feels odd to rate minor kitchen implements as 5 stars. but this OXO meat tenderizer definitely works the way it should. The spiky end pokes holes in the meat nicely and the flat end flattens out thick chicken breasts in no time flat. It's fun to use (or at least I think so!) and it doesn't require a huge amount of strength. The grip is comfortable and doesn't lend itself to flying out of your hands. It's easy to clean - meat doesn't cling to the spiky end - and while it probably isn't rated for dishwasher use. that never stops me from throwing it in anyway. and I've had no problems.~ Ana Mardoll"
2,"I love OXO utensils and have many of them.  But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher.  Pound raw meat; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water. right?  The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum.  Now this one looks like old aluminum--it's gray and nasty looking. Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel.  It's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils."
2,"I saw all the warnings about this item not being dishwasher safe. I saw the sticker on the flat side of the mallet. Good to go. as I hand wash my dishes. After having used the thing and cleaned it right after I was done. one evening when I was tired I simply I tossed it in with the few dishes and utensils soaking in hot water. Big mistake. After that. this thing was ruined. It should have been obvious. Why would something not be dishwasher safe? The high temperatures. of course. I knew not to put it in the dishwasher. but I did not want chicken juice getting crusted on the thing and so I put it in with everything else to hand wash.Simple mistake. Cost me $15. Save yourself the trouble and try to find something that is stainless steel."
2,"I am yet another fan of OXO Good Grips products.  The meat tenderizer is another good product.  It is very ergonomic. and it's heavy/solid so that you don't have to pound as hard as you would with more lightweight tenderizers.I don't like the fact that you can't put it in the dishwasher. but really. scrub it with some anti-bacterial dish soap and you're all set.  After shopping at several home product stores in search of a tenderizer. I came back to the OXO Good Grips because I found it the best. in spite of not being able to put it in the dishwasher."
2,"My last masher (from a respected and pricey brand name) couldn't take the pressure-literally!  One day I'm just mashing up a batch of potatoes and *snap&#34; it's time for the trash bin.  That's why I bought this masher from OXO.This one is a solid. heavy-gauge steel wire that goes all the way up into the sturdy handle.  I'm not sure I could break it if I tried!  Works great at mashing (just as good as one with square or circle holes). and the large grip makes it easy to hold even if you get a little butter on your hands (trust me. I have done it)."
2,"Sturdy metal potato smasher. which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.  We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef. ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat.  It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network. and once I learned this trick. it really made that step in cooking so much easier.  Also. we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.  Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat.  It just makes sense."
2,"For my husbands and I's first Christmas I asked for a potato masher. He got this exact one and I can say that I've used it once a week for 10 years and its still perfect. The handle is just fine and it never rusted or anything. I love all the Oxo products. they really do last years and years. I've bought other companies products for the kitchen and they fall apart. is I specifically look for Oxo Good Grips whenever I go get a kitchen gadget because I know it will last for years. One tip. after you mash the potatoes rinse off the potato from the masher because once that potato dries it takes alot of work to remove."
2,"This is a great. old-fashioned style of potato masher. which produces the type of mashed potatoes I remember from my childhood. What it has. though. that ones from many years ago did not is the OXO ergonometric design. with a comfortable handle. It also contains a hole at the top of the handle for hanging on a rack.This is excellent not only for potatoes. but for apples. carrots. various kinds of squash. turnips and other soft-cooked fruits and vegetables.The masher is made of durable stainless steel that helps you avoid rust."
2,"I purchased Several OXO Good Grips including a Lemon/Lime Reamer. Cheese Plane. Wire Potato Masher and Box Grader.  They were all reasonably priced and are made of good quality material.  The potato masher is the best that I have ever used and I use it for everything.  I like to mix bell pepper and onions in ground beef instead of using a large spoon.  Add a can of black olives in the mix and mash them up also.  I would recommend this brand.  The handle has a nice grip and is nice and soft.  I considered this brand because I have the wire whisks and other products by OXO."
2,"I made the pefect lumpy potatoes with this.  Sounds odd. but that's what I wanted.  I have a ricer. but I wanted the mashed potatoes from my childhood.  I went out and bought this specifically for the task.  I have no regrets or complaints.  The handle felt fine. better than what my mother used to have.  I remember hers having more mashing surface. but that may be because I was young.  This one seems compact. so it works fine for a small amount of potatoes in a smaller bowl (perfect for me.)If you want ultra smooth. this isn't the product for you.  Get the Oxo ricer."
2,"So far I have to say that this is the best masher I've ever had. and at 65. I have had or used any number of them.  The &#34;wire&#34; portion is solid. sturdy and will never bend.  The handle is long. has an adequate circumference and is padded. making it easy to grip and at the same time. comfortable.  To top it all off. the end of the handle has extra padding on it so when you bear down it doesn't feel uncomfortable.  Great product and worth the price!"
2,"Bought this to replace a similar one I'd had for many many years.  I really liked the old one. but had repaired the handle many times & it was now beyond repair.  Wish I'd bought this one sooner!  The soft grip is wonderful. & the ridges on the working surface make it glide thru the cheese much easier; no more bogging down. no more  bunched up cheese slices.  Just a nice. wafer thin piece of cheese that does not stick to the plane when you try to take it off."
2,"My husband doesn't mind this. but I hate it and won't use it.  I will grab the pairing knife if our traditional stringed cheese cutter is dirty. before grabbing this.  It is too flimsy in my opinion (surprising really for Oxo). to do its job. and it very difficult to get to the end of your cut without removing a whole CHUNK of cheese from the end.  I guess the other reviewers are right - you are either one who loves cheese planes. or you don't :(."
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
2,"Heavy. smooth action. sharp.  My husband makes an ultra-deep-dish 'priazzo' about 2 inches deep. and this cuts right through - extra pepperoni. extra veggies. extra cheese. extra thick crust. it can handle it all!  Plus. it feels good in your hand.  Nice piece of equipment.Update 7/3/12: I suddenly realized a couple of weeks ago that this wheel wasn't working as well as it used to. so I decided to sharpen it for the first time. It was a little tricky to run through my Chef's Mate. but it's working a little better now. I'm thinking I'll need to replace it in a year or so. Still. it was used about once a week for about 4.5 years; if I get another year out of it. that's not too shabby!"
2,"OXO makes great products at a great price.  It is that simple.  I am sure there are better products out there at four or six times the price. but OXO makes the best stuff at the best price - it is that simple.This pizza wheel is excellent.  I have read other reviews where people moan about how large it is.  These people are idiots.  First of all. it says before you buy it how large it is. so these people are either too stupid to read or too lazy to read.Second of all. one of the reasons why I bought this is because it is large. and the weight makes it easier to cut through pizza.Some people who reviewed this said it was not sharp when they got this.  I admit this might be a pain to sharpen if it was dull. but mine is sharp so no problems there.A great product."
2,"I don't know what I expected but this pizza wheel is large! But it is also the best we've owned in the past 25 years. It rolls easily and with the sharpness of the wheels blade it'll cut through just about any kind of pizza you want it to.The grip (like on all of the OXO Good Grip items) is excellent. and it is made to last. High quality construction. great blade. and grate grip. and great price. What else can I say.I would recommend it to anyone."
2,"I have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult.  This has great grip. great balance (it looks like it should be off but it's not).  Super cutting edge - one pass cuts even thin crispy crusts - which my old cutter took several passes to accomplish.  It's heavy but really well balanced so I think that combination might be what helps it to cut so well.Would buy it again & highly recommend it.Note - it is big - think they said 4'.  Most pizza wheels that I've seen are much smaller.  I had to find a new storage space for it but totally worth it."
2,"I finally broke down and got one of these after getting fed up at dragging my knuckles through the pizza with my old. small wheel cutter. Boy am I glad I did! This cutter works sooo much better. I don't know if it's sharper. or if it's because it has more heft. but it cuts right through those pizza crusts. like a charm.  I have also used it to cut pastry and dough and it works really well at that. too. Finally. it cleans up quickly easily. Definitely a great gadget every kitchen should have."
2,"This pizza wheel is so much bigger and nicer than the little $2 pizza cutter I had that I uploaded a picture for comparison.  First of all. it's huge and makes quick work of even your deepest deep dish pizza.  You hardly have to apply any force at all.  It has a very nice weight and quality feel to it.  I hand wash and dry this so that it will last a really long time.I have been adding Oxo kitchen tools to my arsenal over time. and it has become one of my favorite brands along with KitchenAid. Cuisinart. Calphalon. etc.If you are willing to pay $12 for a pizza cutter you won't be disappointed with this one.  It may be the last one you buy."
2,"Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss. and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement.  I landed on this one!  And then it came in the mail.  Great quality. expect it will last five times longer than our first (somewhat cheap) one did.  BUT.  This thing is giant!  Do you know how big four inches is?  I may just be really dumb but I've never seen a pizza cutter this big for home use.  It looks like something you'd use in home defense.  Who needs a pot when you've got a gigantic sharp round blade to swing? Seriously. I didn't know I'd have to lock it away from the children. but I really don't think it's safe to leave in reach of even our oldest.  It works great. though.  I guess it's for serious pizza eaters."
2,"when given the choice. i always buy oxo. it's the most comfortable for my hands. this pizza wheel is great. sharp. and cuts clean. and i found it for a steal at ross dress for less at $3.99!!!!!! would i buy it at amazon for the inflated price? uh. no. even if i didn't find it at $3.99. i would have bought it at bed. bath. and beyond for cheaper with their 20% off coupons. amazon. if you want to stay competitive. price your items lower!"
2,"A pizza cutter isn't something you think about all that often until you need one. Well. I did. Not only does Pizza Hut never cut my pizzas all the way through. but frozen ones don't come with any slice cuts at all. So you gotta have one of these. My old one must have been about as sharp as a spoon because it took many. many rolls across the pizza surface to make a cut. Missed a lot and created too many super narrow slices. This little guy does it perfectly in one pass. so I'm a fool for having waited so long to buy one."
2,"This is my second pizza cutter in my entire life. It is everything I thought it would be and more. I love the grippy handle and the huge wheel. I use it on my home made pizza. Yes. I make the dough from scratch along with everything else. It cuts my dough to perfectlion. I don't buy pizza from the store or from chains. so I don't know how it would work on other pizzas. I think that if it was used on store-bought pizza it might be comparable to cutting through a cardboard box. That is not what this item is designed to do. Use a box cutter for that. Overall it is highly recommended by me. Keep in mind that I also make whole wheat dough and like it extra crispy. It does beautiful job."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
2,"This must be the worst product I've ever purchased that sports the OXO label. And I've got a lot of the stuff. and have been generally satisfied with it. I needed a channel knife. wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife (instead of pulling it long-ways towards you--look at other channel knives. you'll know what I mean). This gadget cuts the raggediest. least-attractive lemon twists ever. and it's hard to pull through the rind as well. So I thought OK. it's still a good zester. And.....No-it's-not. Get a microplane. or maybe a different zester. but this one is a turd. Finally. the handle is not 'comfortable.' it's too hard and too big for my (fairly small but not outrageously so) hand. The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy."
2,"I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 for any of you who care). I have only about 1/3 use of my hands and about 1/2 use of my arms. but I can use this zester--not with great ease. but I can use it!  I cannot use any other  zester I have tried.My mother has mild arthritis and she likes my Oxo  tools better than her own (even the ones she's grown to love over the  years).The zesting blades are sharp and at the perfect angle.  You get  perfect zest with little effort.  And you get NO pith (bitter white  part).As with almost all Oxo tools the design is excellent: it is highly  ergonomic--it fits the hand and works the way it should."
2,"Most kitchens probably do not have a lemon zester as a routine item. but the OXO zester is a must for both casual and professional cooks. The problem with most zesters is they aren't sharp enough to properly zest only  the lemon peel but instead give you white pith along with the zest. But the  OXO only gives you the best of the lemon as it stainless steel blade cuts  sharply and cleanly. Another excellent feature is a built in garnishing  tool that allows you to cut designs into citrus fruit thus giving you two  kitchen gadgets for the price of one. The zester is quite durable and goes  through the dishwasher quite well too. This tool is also extremely safe for  even the youngest of hands as its slip proof construction allows you to  grip it easily without fear of slipping and hurting oneself. So add some  zest the OXO way!"
2,"I don't know if other zesters would be better. as I have not used any prior to purchasing this one.If this is going to be your first zester. I recommend this one. This is my first and I appreciate the price and quality. It makes the job very easy and the size of the zest depends on how big your strokes are. You can make them pretty small too.Other reviews make a good point emphasizing that it does miss some spots. I feel like it's a very minor thing though and many zester will miss pieces too. but don't get this product if you are aiming to get 100% of the zest. It's not a big deal for me personally though as I feel like it misses less than 10% so I can always get another fruit out.MAIN POINTS: Easy to use. easy to clean. great zest of varied size. but does miss some zest. Overall. a great product."
2,"Before purchasing this nifty little zester. I would always leave the zest out of any recipe that called for it.  Whenever I tried to use a grater. the colored zest would stick inside the holes.  If I kept on grating until the zest came out the other side. then I'd also get bits of bitter pith that would ruin the taste and the recipe.This tool makes perfect zest that includes only the flavorful colored part of the citrus peel.  You run it lightly over the surface of the peel. and it makes ultra-thin strips of colored zest.  The tool is easy to control. and a snap to use.  I use mine to make non-bitter-tasting orange. lemon. and lime zests for homemade sorbets. ices. and ice creams."
2,"Every chef says the best mashed potatoes are made with a ricer so I treated myself to this one.  I found the handles a little uncomfortable...silicone or rubber on them might help.  Pressing the potato through isn't as easy as chefs make it look but I found if I put the bowl in the sink and then leaned the lower handle on the sink and pressed down. it was much easier and kind of fun.The potatoes came through very fluffy but really once you add the milk and butter. they become creamy so I don't know about this 'fluffy mashed potatoes' I keep reading about.  But using the ricer is much more consistent than mashing...not a chance of lumps so they're very very smooth.  I'd definitely recommend this product."
2,"I had my doubts about this item because it felt a little flimsy when I removed it from the box. It's lightweight and the handles seemed a little small. However. it worked flawlessly and made super-smooth mashed potatoes. It's very easy to press the potatoes through the holes.The only downside is that it takes a little time because you can't fit a whole potato in the ricer. you need to cut the potato into workable chunks. and it's a little bit messy. But the consistent smoothness is well worth it. I liked this much. much better than a standard masher.A couple of tips: make sure you use soft enough potatoes (I used russets) and place the potato so that the peel faces the top. not the holes. You also must remove the peel each time you press (that's where the messy part comes in.)Recommended!"
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"I honestly only use this ricer on potatoes. and only after my 'food mill' has done all the work. yet has left me with a few hard scraps that won't pass through the blade.  I place the scraps into the ricer and voila. no wasted potatoes.I was watching Chef Michael Chiarello on the Food Network and this is the exact model he uses on his mashed potatoes. It's construction is solid and smooth.I myself do not make spaetzle. so I cannot comment on its uses for making that dish; however. for making potatoes. when combined with the food mill. it serves a purpose for me. If I could only afford one tool for mashed potatoes. I'd opt for the 'food mill'."
2,"This tool is a must-have for preparing mashed potatoes. It takes all of the effort and lumps out of making perfect mashed potatoes.A little bit of potatoes can squeeze out from the top of the lid as you push it down (which is why I only gave 4 stars) but since the gap is so narrow. what squeezes out is also 'mashed' so it can be thrown in with the rest of the potatoes.My girlfriend complained that it is a little hard to squeeze when packed to the rim with potatoes. but this can be controlled by putting less potatoes in it each time.Overall an excellent product. Very easy to clean."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
2,"I find it hard to imagine how I've done without a potato ricer all my life!  The Oxo potato ricer is a great size for one to two people (though it would also work well for a larger crowd on special occasions. it would just take a little longer) and is well constructed. I found six medium potatoes made a nice bowl of mashed potatoes for two. I didn't mind not having the interchangeable disks. the size of the holes on this ricer were just the perfect size to make nice. fluffy Yukon Gold potatoes. I even threw two cloves of garlic into the pot with the potatoes. then riced them along with the potatoes for a very tasty bowl of garlic potatoes. I'm seriously impressed with the Oxo potato ricer and highly recommend it!"
2,"Great little kitchen gadget. Simple. well made and should last a lifetime when used properly. My wife is really happy with the contraption. it makes it a lot quicker when making cakes. pies etc to rice the fruits than cutting. squashing. smashing etc just insert and out it comes all uniformly so that it can be easily folded into your mixes.Originally was purchased because she wanted to make her own hash-browns... Been over two weeks... Still waiting on them.I have learned that whenever the wife wants a kitchen gadget to always search Amazon first. The heck with going to stores. calling around or asking. IF you can't find it here. you probably cannot find it in a store. It is usually MUCH cheaper to order online than driving around searching or waiting for hours for someone that has no clue what the item is or IF they even have it."
2,"It's a ricer. there isn't a lot of magic going on here to report on.  It's basically a large garlic press that you can use to make smooth mashed potatoes. assuming you don't know what a ricer is.The quality of construction is good. the ease of use is good. and the price is good.  I wish there was more to talk about. but the device is just too simple to get really in depth.One down side would be the ricer could be a tad bigger so you can rice more potato at a time. but its not bad.I would buy this again."
2,"Because my daughter is a HUGE fan of mashed potatoes I finally broke down and got a ricer for perfect potatoes every time.  I LOVE this item.1)I boil my potatoes with the skins on until they are very tender.2)I rice them one at a time WITHOUT removing the skins. The flesh drops into the bowl of butter and cream below while the skins stay behind in the ricer (and typically stick to the plunger. so I simply nudge them off into the garbage between potatoes.)3)I toss the ricer in the open position into my dishwasher and forget it!4)I give the potatoes a quick stir and voila!  Rich. creamy. smooth mashed potatoes with no peeling. dicing. or beating with a cumbersome electric mixer.Maybe ALL ricers perform this well. but honestly. this item is the best.  I am so happy with this purchase."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
2,"OXO designs great products and this is no exception.  It does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top.  I just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease.  I liked it so much. I bought one for my aunt.Before this. I made mashed potatoes with a masher; the difference is unbelievable.  I kept my masher because I'm a Southern girl and sometimes I want lumpy mashed potatoes.This is easy to clean -- throw it in the dishwasher."
2,"I first bought this to squeeze out the juice from potatoes when making hash browns but its first use was actually making mashed potatoes.  For that purpose it works great. mashed potatoes are very fluffy using this and it is very easy to use.  My kids love watching me make it and like using it themselves.  The plate that mashes down on the potatoes is not a very tight seal so you will have some small amount of potatoes that squeeze through the top part. but it's OK. I just throw those in with the mashed potatoes as well because they come out mashed.  It is pretty easy to clean as well. I just use a strong stream of water into the &#34;cup&#34; and then the other way from outside through the small holes.  Then I do a quick wash with dishwashing detergent.  Definitely glad I bought this!"
2,"I have heard for quite some time how wonderful Potato Ricers are. They process the Potato in one squeeze. and prevent over mixing and creating glue when using a stand mixer. I decided to see for myself if I preferred riced potatoes. The first time I used the OXO Ricer. the Potatoes came out creamy and delicious. The texture was different than whipped Potatoes. and the flavor was more &#34;natural&#34;. I didn't need to stir in as much butter or cream as I usually would when I used the stand mixer. I now use the Ricer every time I make Mashed Potatoes. and really enjoy this new method. The OXO Ricer is easy to use. easy to clean. and the padded grips prevent hand cramping if you are processing a larger batch. - Highly recommended."
2,"Prior to recently I did not have much experience with potato ricers but when reading about different gnocchi techniques they were regularly mentioned as providing smooth and even potatoes and other vegetables of the like.  I was a bit hesitant to purchase something that seemingly accomplished one task...mashing. which is something I have been able to do with a masher or a mixer.  Regardless I took the plunge and I must say it has been a worthwhile purchase.This ricer produces consistently smooth potatoes.  I have also used it with sweet potatoes. acorn squash. squeezing liquid from spinach and grated jalapeno and to juice lemons.  It has done all of these effortlessly and consistently.I find myself using it at least once a week while preparing dinner. often times just to make mashed potatoes for one.  It allows me to make what was once a relatively involved side dish in under two minutes of active kitchen work.I plan on gifting a few of these in the coming months."
2,"I was helping my niece set up her new home and we were trying to buy a lot of things for not that much money.  I think it's so important to have good knives - but when I went looking - the really good ones were SO much money.  I decided to try this pair because of the name - OXO - I have loved every one of the products I have purchased from them - and the price.  Well. I was so impressed. I had to buy a set for myself as well.  These are the knives I reach for everyday.  My expensive set of knives are on my counter. but the convenience. comfortable feel and the good job that the OXO knives do - they are the ones I use most often.  At this price. I can't imagine any home without them!"
2,"A very nice set - the only complaint I would have would be not so much a complaint but an observation that the cracker is seemingly designed for larger shells.  It is not as effective for smaller pieces unless you place them and attempt to hold them in place right in the middle of the unit where the two pads come together and actually make contact.  It is very heavy duty and comfortable though and does just fine.  The only modification I'd recommend to OXO would be to design the cracker to come closer together at the hinged end.  I'd still get it again though if anything happened to it."
2,"We have two and have given 2-3 as gifts. Everyone loves them. They are solid and sturdy. Just the right weight. So far. no rusting or chipping. They feel good and are easy to use.The crackers work much better than the ones we've had for 30 years (and which probably cost 99 cents at the time). There is no wobble in the hinge and the large middle cracking area is perfect for just cracking crab and lobster legs without crushing them.The picks are well made. The forked design works much better than the curved single-tine picks and the spoon scoop end easily finishes the job.This set is expensive. Many sets are available for half or less. That's the reason for only 4 stars. I have not compared the quality of the cheaper sets. so maybe these are really worth the extra. I'm glad we have them."
2,"I have used a P38 for over 40 years; I find it to be light weight and ready to use at a moment's notice.However the Oxo good grips will hold the can in place while opening the lid. Not being on the chain. you can also open it with your arms extended; this comes in handy when you are opening cat food.  This also does not require you to be so dexterous.  Your finger does not become calloused.  And it does not get lost in the dishwasher.Just be sure while the cat is sniffing the can. that you don't grind his whiskers.GI - P- 38 - Can Opener"
2,"We got rid of the automatic can opener because we wanted one that could easily be cleaned after each use.  We do not put the Oxo Good Grips into the dishwasher. but we do rinse it after each use.  After a few years use. even tho the blade itself has no rust. the recessed screw area and portions of the handle has rusted badly.  You'd think that it would not be that costly to use stainless screws. washer. and nuts. and it would certainly improve the quality greatly.  It works easily and smoothly enough. even though it is a little bulky for smaller hands and in the drawer.  We thought that by purchasing one of the more expensive brands. it would not rust. so that part is disappointing."
2,"When I was a kid. my parents went through more electric can openers than I care to count; high complexity. dubious reliability.  The run-of-the-mill manual openers weren't much better; they would usually slip. failing to turn the can and open it.Enter the GoodGrips can opener - I picked one of these up over a year ago. and it's functioned perfectly ever since.  The all-stainless construction means no fear of dishwashers. though you'll want to keep metal utensils from banging into the blade.  The rubber handles are very comfortable. and the big fat plastic crank handle handily rotates the can with no contortions whatsoever.  Simple and inexpensive but effective - I've been very satisfied with this product.In fact. it was so good I gave one to my mother. and she hasn't complained about it a bit!"
2,"I bought 3 of the Oxo Good Grips can openers.  We kept two and gave my son one.  The first one died within a month when the black plastic tip broke.  We used the second one and again the black tip broke leaving it useless.  When I warned my son about the black plastic tip he told me that a chip broke in his but it still works.We are now using a cheap $1.99 pair we bought from Walmart. At least it opens a can. that is more than I can say about Oxo.OXO Good Grips Can Opener"
2,"I have owned this can opener for 3 years now and I am still mostly happy with it. It features comfortable rubber grip handles and an ergonomicle hand crank (my favorite part). Due to the design. I notice less stress and strain on my hands and wrists using this product than I had with cheaper models. I have not noticed any rusting or other problems as far as functionality is concerned. The rubber handles have loosened a bit and slide down occassionally. but this has not been problematic as of yet. All and all it has been a good product and if I ever needed a new one. I would be willing to buy this same model again."
2,"OXO Soft-Handled Can Opener. Item # 28081. This is a hard-to-clean kitchen tool. Not all the metal parts are stainless so they get pitted and retain food particles. Also. the soft handles are not sealed onto the body of the can opener. so dishwater accumulates in them. and therefore so do rotting food particles. mold... you get the point. It is possible to pull off the handles and wash all the surfaces. but what a pain! And then. the handles wear and loosen so they start to slide when opening cans. After three months. I replaced the Oxo Good Grips Can Opener with aZyliss Lock-n-Lift Can Openerwhich. after six months. still works very well."
2,"I have a philosophy that will not allow me to buy crummy tools. Tools for anything.... if they do not work or do not last. they are worthless. That's why I paid 14 bucks for a hand-operated can opener. Being an engineer I looked at the design and was impressed by the symmetrical (rather than cantilevered) hinge. I reasoned that this would make the opener sturdy and allow it to work as intended for a long time. IT DID NOT. This overpriced piece of trash DOES NOT open cans. There may be other uses for it but opening cans is not one of them. That's why I'm on Amazon today. I am throwing this junk out and buying 6 of the 2 dollar can openers. That should last me my lifetime and leave 1 or 2 to bequeath to my survivors. Yes it is making me depart from my lifelong philosophy (and that makes me mad) but it is in self-defense. I am hungry and I CAN NOT OPEN ANY CANS."
2,"I've had them all!  Wood. Plastic and Aluminum and I prefer the Aluminum type.Even though the wood works a little bit better. it's harder to clean and after a while it starts to look gunky and unhealthy.  Hard to wash the wood after it's been used a while and the wood is no longer smooth.  No matter how hard you wash. it still feels slimy and that's what bothers me.You may have to work a bit harder with the plastic or aluminum but when you wash them. they're clean and they feel clean."
2,"The Good:  These tongs are cheap and adequate.  I needed a long pair of tongs with metal ends to work in the grill and hot pans and this this did the trick.  They open and close with ease. just like the smaller versions you can buy.  Additionally. arms of the tongs are well made.The Bad:  The ends of these tongs are very thin and mine came twisted a slight bit.  It all gave the impression of being slightly cheaply made. but for $15 you get what you pay for."
2,"...the spring rusts. I own both the 12' (for normal indoor cooking) and the 16' (for grilling). I have used both countless times. They grip food well and you feel as though you have a firm hold of the hood too. In all the times I have used them. I have discovered two main flaws. The first flaw is the flexibility (bend-ibility)of the 'hands'. the part of the tongs that actually touches the food. If you grasp the food too tight. they bend. This means the they will not close tight without bending them back into shape. The second is the metal used in the spring. This metal is prone to rust and when it rusts the tongs no longer have their normal spring and often get stuck. My advice would be to spend a little more money and get a hight quality."
2,"Searched high and low for the perfect tongs for non-stick surfaces that didn't cost a fortune and of course found the OXO brand to perfectly fit the bill (as usual).  These are not too long. perfect for kitchen use.  Their tips are not the annoying soft silicone type like so many out there but instead a harder tip that is angled and pointed so you can use then for a number of surfaces or into pots of boiling things.  I really love the feel of these in my smallish hands and that they lock is an added bonus so they don't take up tons of room in your drawer.  Perfect!"
2,"I bought the 12&#34; size 6 years ago and they are still serving me well. I just bought the 16&#34; & 9&#34; sizes for almost $30 and if they are as good as the older 12&#34; ones. I'm OK with spending that coin. They are easy to clean. do not rust. and the locking mechanism is super nice! Cheap tongs with that cheesy metal slide annoy me to no end as they enviably slide down and lock the tongs when I need to pick something up. Spontaneous locking is not a problem with these."
2,"I have had these for a couple years. and I think I use them almost every day. The locking feature is really handy. and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands. The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy. cool grip.I have one minor complaint. the tongs don't work well with delicate things. For example. with chicken parmesan. the breading rips right off. Now. we'll eat anything. so it isn't a big deal to us. I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods."
3,"This book is a reissue of an old one; the author was born in 1910. It's of the era of. say. Nero Wolfe. The introduction was quite interesting. explaining who the author was and why he's been forgotten; I'd never heard of him.The language is a little dated at times. like calling a gun a &#34;heater.&#34;  I also made good use of my Fire's dictionary to look up words like &#34;deshabille&#34; and &#34;Canarsie.&#34; Still. it was well worth a look-see."
3,"This is a short story focused on Darth Maul's role in helping the Trade Federation gain a mining colony. It's not bad. but it's also nothing exceptional. It's fairly short so we don't really get to see any characters develop. The few events that do happen seem to go by quickly. including what should have been major battles. The story is included in the novelShadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul). which is worth reading. so don't bother to buy this one separately."
3,"I have a version of 'Star by Star' that does not include the novella 'Recovery.' so I downloaded this book onto my Fire.  'Recovery' tells of Leia's recovery after she was nearly killed in 'Balance Point.'  If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia's relationship. it surely failed.  There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation.  They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out. like in the DVD's. where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.  It was worth it. but probably not to everyone."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
3,"The events of 'Ylesia' take place during 'Destiny's Way.'  If you've read 'Destiny's Way.' you will see it mentioned in passing.Jaina and Jacen go to Ylesia to fight the Peace Brigade to show them that it's not good to align themselves with the enemy.  From there. it is page after page of battle scenes.  It is endless.  One huge chapter.  It's like the chapter that was cut out for good reason.'Ylesia' doesn't advance 'Destiny's Way' or 'The New Jedi Order' in any way that I could tell.  We don't learn anything new.  There is no insight.  If I had skipped it. I wouldn't have missed anything.If you don't mind reading in PDF. 'Ylesia' is available free from Del Rey.  If you Google. you'll see it linked to the Wayback machine and it's still there."
3,"For whatever reason. Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The 'Tales of...' are great in that they explain background characters. However.Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work. this is mostly a book of action. not intricate plot development. In fact. the story ends with an exciting twist. but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love. or included a really interesting plot twist. Also. just to note. this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version."
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
3,"The WSJ for Kindle is overpriced. and the customer service has gone completely haywire since the newspaper was bought out.  I have read and subscribed by Kindle. print edition. and iPhone app (WSJ Mobile).  Unfortunately. they are all horrible in contebt delivery--even though the writing is still superb--and try calling them.  10 minute waits to speak to someone in a different country who will put you on hold. and then when you try to cancel. it is abysmal.  More waiting.  I will never be part of WSJ Online. pinrt. Mobile or Kindle after my recent experiences.  Again. the company has been bought out and is now on its way out.  Beware."
3,"This is it. the big kahuna of financial newspapers delivered right to your Kindle. You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this. This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle. It only lets you view the content on the Kindle. No printing articles. no emailing articles to a friend. no using it in presentations. You are stuck. Very evil is it not !So. if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend."
3,"This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered.  There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web.  The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome.  Graphs. photos. and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format.  It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access.  WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible.  Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete. you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies.  I am seriously considering canceling.6/2/2012 Update: I have canceled my subscription."
3,"ten days into my trial subscription and i have decided to cancel. have read the wsj for 30 years and i guess i have one foot in the digital world and one in the analog world.i won't repeat all of the other comments. i can concur on the difficulties of making the transition to kindle reading. if i was still in a job that had me traveling alot it might make sense but since i pick up my wsj of my front porch it just doesn't work.the one thing that really baffles me is how to cancel a free trial. unless the magic button is hiding right out in the open. i can't find a website or kindle method to cancel. i had to call into customer service and yes. it got taken care of but i was disconnected three times before i made it into the queue. the fidelity of the call made it almost impossible to understand what the person was saying. and the english of the rep was spotty at best. not up to the usual amazon quality."
3,"I am a big fan of the NY Times and see it as one of the top newspapers in the U.S.  One: $19.99 for the Kindle download covers every edition for the month.  Okay. say you miss looking at it for a day or two. that is still an excellent price.  You don't have time to read it all. no problem.  The fact is this is an everyday download.  Well worth the price.  Two. and listen up. you also get access to the NY Times on their homepage giving you the articles and the opportunity of email letters sent to your box which outline the major stories of the day. just in case your life has been particularly busy.  Like I said. downloading the NY Times through Amazon is a Double Plus.  Pass this on."

3,"The NY Times in Kindle format is great!  The majority of the paper is there each day and it's easy to navigate and read.  The print portion of articles is good. but the quality of the limited number of pictures or other rare graphics could be better.  Sometimes there's an article missing one day; then it pops up in the next day's issue.  That's acceptable to me because I know at some point the day's edition has to be closed and distributed.  What I really like is not having the annoying distraction of ads.  Considering the excellent content. the cost isn't that bad at ~$0.67/day.12/26/2010 update: After two months I've canceled the subscription.  I would subscribe again if the cost was $10/month but at $20/month it is too expensive for a digital edition of the paper."
3,"With a life of one day it is very difficult to rate a newspaper  - they are read for news and other items and serve an extremely practical purpose.  The New York Times has a good reputation and that stands  and whilst in the USA it is a good daily read with interesting articles. news items etc.  If it wasn't up to standard. it would fade away very quickly so &#34;reviewing it&#34; is a little unnecessary.  Enjoy the paper. read it for leisure and information and be thankful you don't live in a nation without such information readily available and virtually free."
3,"I admit I am biased. as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance. entertainment. style. and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate. filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion. I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture. or something).  The online editions can be hard to read. and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have. but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork. the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers). easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition. in a great reading format.Well done!"
3,"Why is it that these great newspapers cannot figure out the digital format?  The kindle versions frequently are stripped down versions without photos and charts and in many cases without some of the sections.  Do they really think that people want to pay for that.  There are too many free news sources that can accomplish this level of news.  If they really want to get subscribers to pay. they need to provide a newspaper experience (some people even like the ads!!)  The new Kindle version of the New York Times is an example of an improved newspaper experience where the kindle version has even more pictures than the paper in some cases (this is what digital can excel at).  The times still has its weaknesses but its an improvement.  The Post is still not worth buying digitally."
3,"It's nice to see an author go back and visit the New Jedi Order era. This time. Karen Traviss combines fan favorite Boba Fett and NJO favorite Nom Anor to show the Mandalorians' role in the Yuuzhan Vong war. Traviss does a pretty good job fitting both into their characters. Boba Fett is appropriately cynical. but at the same time also concerned about the Mandalorians. Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation. We also get to see Nom Anor's private thoughts and a bit more insight into his time as infiltrator.Even for a short story. it seemed a bit too short and ends rather abruptly. I would have liked to have seen  bit more. or at least learn what the Mandalorians did after the first few weeks of the invasion. It's tough to be satisfied with this after reading Unifying Force. where Han sees Boba Fett fighting alongside Alliance troops. Hopefully that story will be written one day."
3,"I have read several Shannon Stacey books and the Devlin Group series is by far my favorites!  This book is the 1ST of the 3 book series (in order:  72 hours. On the Edge. No Surrender).  I never read books twice. but I will definitely be revisiting this series and I saw on the authors website that a 4th one is in the works!  I can't say enough about this series and can definitely not pick a favorite!  I have read some other reviews on this 1st book and can't say I agree with the 3 and 4 star ratings. but for those of you who would be willing to read more. finish the series before you write a complete review."
3,"Alex Rossi aka Sean Devlin is leading a double life--he's the founder of Devlin Group as Sean Devlin; and he's Alex Rossi (his real name). one of Devlin Groups senior agents. His lifetime goal has been to find & kill the man who murdered his mother.Grace Nolan is an ex- agent. and considers Sean Devlin a friend. When her young son. Danny. is kidnapped. she's forced to ask Devlin Group to help her find & rescue him. The kidnapper just happens to be the killer Alex is seeking. and the killer knows the secret connection between Grace & Alex---Danny is Alex's son---although Alex just found that out. He's furious Grace never told him about Danny. She was furious Alex shot her just before she found out she was pregnant!!This romantic suspense book has plenty of action scenes; tense moments; great one-liners; and great secondary characters who more than likely will have their own stories; I.e.. Gallagher & Carmen."
3,"This was a mildly interesting. slightly humorous. day-to-day chronicle of a very boring guy's life. I found the historical insights engaging. and some of the daily activities of people in those days interesting. I wish that there had been a little more about the wider events that were happening beyond just the writer's activities. But. then. that would not have been in concert with the title of the book. The author certainly believed in truth in advertising. The title of the book says it all. It's a quick read and never complex."
3,"This is Twain's satire of contemporary religious mores. It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime. and like much of his later work. it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic. although more upbeat than. for example. _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall. but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can. or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views. more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout. but no more than that. and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read. at 630 kindle 'locations'."
3,"Great book.  I always like fairy tales.  For some. the tales are a bit morbid and not suitable for children of today.  Guess I am not sure what I have been told that.  I guess the reason is that TV is the primary culture-resources input allowed by parents and society to pickle the minds of today's children since there is no requirement for an education that would allow them to read?I recommend Grimm because the stories allow those that can read the opportunity to exercise their mind in the &#34;original&#34; virtual space (imagination).Get it!  It's free!"
3,"This is a greatest-hits grab bag of 25 stories from the Grimm's Fairy Tales collection. unillustrated. and apparently taken from the 1884 Margaret Hunt translation.

3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
3,"I would highly recommend this classic to everyone from young teens to our most senior adults.  Warning it is a long. involved tale that can't be read in one evening.  Since every character is a man. it is a less than sentimental journey.  Though they are definitely some tearful scenes.  One character is a former slave. but is treated as the others' equal though somewhat condescendedly.  I enjoyed looking back at a culture and customs that are long gone.  And no spoilers. but you may want to read another Verne classic when done with this one..."
3,"I finally read this book last month and enjoyed every chapter. It shows how they managed to survive on the island by making tools and items in their cave. This book is by far one of the best 'stranded on an island' books you could hope for. It is probably one of Jules Verne's best. The inhabitants of an island are banded together and when they get into a tight spot. there is a mysterious force that always helps out. This force is not revealed until nearly the end. I highly recommend it to everyone."
3,"Read this book years ago and enjoyed it then. however. I enjoyed it even more reading it on my Kindle. What has inspired me about this book is the people in the book on the island are very different. yet come together to work together and survive. Yes. I know that there are lots of reviews on this book. however. what I want to say to you is that if you are looking for a book that will inspire you that you can survive anything. then read this book.And if read in a low time in your life. it will be meaningful to you to see the right answer. This is what I found that this book did for me. it helped me see what is important and what is not."
3,"Every child should read 20.000 leagues under the sea. a classic adventure.  Following that with just a little prompting they should be intrigues to read this sequel of what happened to Captain Nemo and the Nautilus.  There are a classic few books that in my viewpoint children should be exposed to Tom Sawyer (and its sequel Huckleberry Finn). Last of the Mohicans. Animal Farm.  The Hobbit. Tarzan. Harry Potter. A Yankee in King Arthurs Court...This book is not as good as 20.000 Leagues but if their interest has been peaked tehy may stll wade through this novel and reading these classics is by far a better activity for children than video games."
3,"I came into the book expecting it to be great. and I was surprised that it exceeded even my own inflated expectations. I've read many of Jules Verne's works. and I can sat that I was thoroughly amused the whole time I was reading this book. I've come to the realization that very few writers today even come close to the marvelous works that were wrought by hands such as Jules Verne. Would I recommend it? YES! If you enjoy a little bit of Sci-Fi. a lot of adventure. some laughs. and some good time well spent you'll love reading Jules Verne's &#34;The Mysterious Island&#34;."
3,"This is one of the classic stories of Jules Verne and it is also one of my favorites.  Five prisoners of war escape using a balloon.  Caught in a massive storm they are carried thousands of miles and land on a remote island with no inhabitants.  They begin to build what life they can and they are very creative and ingenious. Their adventures are what make this story so entertaining.  As the true nature of the island is discovered the group is faced with both threats from enemies and help from a mysterious benefactor.Jules Verne's writing and perceptions of the future and Sci-Fi were well ahead of his time.  This is an excellent story and I recommend it to you."
3,"Jules Verne has a knack for detail.  This book has a good plot and a mystery not solved until the end.  This keeps one reading even though it is a very tedious chore.  Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR"
3,"I had never read any of the old Classics so I picked up this book after reading so many good reviews.  It did start a little slow. but at the same time intriguing with the mystery of where the bullet came from.  At times I could not put it down.  I enjoyed all of the characters. and found it very interesting how they created things we take for granted today.  It's hard to remember that people used to have to do everything for themselves. it sure has been a lost art in the western society! I found the writing wonderful and Jules Verne painted wonderful details which made the story itself such a pleasure to read!"
3,"This is the best book I have ever read in my life.  I am 60 years old and read about 100 books a year.  This is a story about a group of men who really care about each other and risk their lives to help each other.  There is plenty of action and adventure to keep your interest. but the true story is this group of men.  I keep it on my Kindle. and when I have nothing else to read. I open the book and re-read it.  I wish modern novels where of this quality.  I enjoy all of his books. but this is his best.  I recommend it to everyone. and it is free. how can it get any better."
3,"When I was growing up. I was not exposed to the literary world.  I purchased this kindle book and am so glad I did.It was. at times. repetitive (I wanted to say. 'OK. you told us that already - a few times&#34;.)  At times. it was idealistic and at other times it was realistic.  The detail of how they made the island their own is educational.I definitely got caught up in it.  I would recommend this book to middle school students & pre-teens with imagination.The language requires attention but is worth the effort."
3,"I liked the creative ideas. the making and building of items.  The whole story was great...except for the killing of so many animals.  the book was written at a different time in the history of the world. the language is interesting to read and understand.  To distroy so much when now we need to save out plantet hurts  to read and think about.The book is worth the reading...as is all of this authors books.Naturally we would perfer he not kill the leading mystery man and the many life forms.The writer was a genuis."
3,"In his day A. Hyatt Verrill was mostly known for his adventure and fantasy stories. Today Verrill is mostly remembered for this little book on knots.Knots are one of mankind's oldest inventions and over the millennia we have evolved thousands of them. Knots are used by everyone from sailors to brain surgeons to join and hold things together. In this book Verrill gathers a few hundred of the most useful knots. shows how to tie them and gives a little bit on their background and uses.The instructions and the accompanying illustrations are clear and at least for the simpler knots makes tying them easy. A wonderful book for everyone from Scouts to sailors to armchair browsing."
3,"I picked this book up because it was free.and I wanted it for reference material. I already know how to tie a large portion of the knots in this book. My biggest problem with this book is that a lot of the pictures didn't load or wouldn't load. Since you can read how to tie a knot it is not to terrible a problem if you know how to tie knots. But someone who doesn't or is a beginner will have problems. All in all it is a good book and is very informative."
3,"I was not disappointed. sometimes sad. sometimes happy but always keeping you turning the pages. I most definitely would read more of this author.You need to realize that it is set in times past. but that only sets the stage for how grateful we should be to live in the here and now.wonderful tale. a keeper.The English OrphansI went to kindle store and downloaded several more of her books and can't wait to start on them. (I went for the freebies so don't know how the 3.00 plus books would be.) formating.english etc. may be better."
3,"OK. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I saw this 'free' book written in the 1800s.  I wouldn't exactly characterize myself as a learned reader of literary classics.  I had just received my Kindle and figured. what have I got to loose?I was absolutely pulled in by this story and had problems putting it down.  It's a captivating mystical love story about an Egyptian princess.  This was the first Haggard book that I've ever read and I will definitely download his more famous literary works to read in the future."
3,"Interesting book about the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan in the 1800s etc. The Indian author Andrew Blackbird wanted to get an education. and was a hard worker. but the money that was sent by the US Government. was not really available to him. as the system. including agents and friends disposed of it first. Another documented case where the system of Indian Agents really did not work well for the Indians. but rather was used by the agents for their benefit. Typical where the system is captured by the persons operating the system. and not by the people the system was set up to serve. He did an excellent job of collecting historical information. and creating a english to the local indian tongue dictionary. A little gem of a book."
3,"This was a book of many wonderful Indian fairy tales. It includes tales both of a 'classical' fairy tale style and ones that are moralistic folktales instead.  All are wonderful.Stories included are:The Lion and the CraneHow the Raja's Son Won the Princess LabamThe LambikinPunchkinThe Broken PotThe Magic FiddleThe Cruel Crane OutwittedLoving LailiThe Tiger. the Brahman and the JackelThe Soothsayer's SonHarisamanThe Charmed RingThe Talkative TortoiseA Lac of Rupees for a Bit of AdviceThe Gold-Giving SerpentThe Son of Seven QueensA Lesson for KingsPride Goeth Before a FallRaja RasaluThe Ass in the Lion's SkinThe Farmer and the Money LenderThe Boy Who had a Moon on his Forehead...The Prince and the FakirWhy the Fish LaughedThe Demon with the Matted HairThe Ivory City and its Fairy PrincessHow Sun. Moon and Wind Went Out to DinnerHow the Wicked Sons were DupedThe Pigeon and the CrowFor more Indian tales you can also check outDeccan Nursery Tales or. Fairy Tales from the SouthorHindu Tales from the Sanskrit. although they are both aimed slightly more towards an audience of children."
3,"Of course I generally knew this story but I had actually never read Charles Dickens before.  I guess it was time and I looked forward to reading this classic.  I sure was disappointed because I hadn't realized how depressing it was.  Dickens' England was not a kind and gentle place.  It was cold and ugly and many people were very cruel.  The story was sad and my heart went out to the poor orphan Oliver.  But he was not the only one who lived a sad life.  All the characters were caught up in a web of unpleasantness and cruelty was everywhere.O.K.  Dickens is a fine writer and I understand how his works have met the test of time.  But life is just too short for me to try to read any Dickens again."
3,"I wasn't sure to expect when I ordered this book. I've heard great reviews. but sometimes when I get around to reading the book. it just doesn't live up to the hype. Not so in this case.I sincerely enjoyed this tale of the young. innocent Oliver Twist and his story of misfortune. While the novel was darker and more violent than I'd at first anticipated. the language flows like poetry. I loved the roller coaster ride Dickens takes us on as Oliver searches to escape the evils forced upon him. only to be pulled back in. The build to the climax of the story was expertly formulated and executed.Oliver Twist is a classic in the true sense of the word. If you've not had the pleasure of reading this novel. don't delay. Order it today."
3,"A very good collection of folk tales from Britain.  The author tried hard to make sure that the stories were commonly from Britain though they may have spread elsewhere or a variation came from elsewhere.  Some very English folk tales?  Henny Penny. Jack and the Beanstalk.  there are many Jack tales. and The Three Bears.  Most have humourous endings and seem to be stories to amuse everyone.  Jacobs.  the author said he used fairy tales in the title because no kid ever asks for a folk tale."
3,"These stories were written in a rough tone and have an unpolished feel to them. This is not necessarily a detraction. and some tales were better than other. but it was occasionally wearying to read them in the poor grammar of colloquial speech. Hence. four stars. Also. it lacks an interactive table of contents.Tales included are;Tom Tit TotThe Three SilliesThe Rose-TreeThe Old Woman and Her PigHow Jack Went to Seek His FortuneMr. VinegarNix Nought NothingJack HannafordBinnorieMouse and MouserCap o'RushesTeeny-TinyJack and the BeanstalkThe Story of the Three Little PigsThe Master and His PupilTitty Mouse and Tatty MouseJack and his Golden Snuff-BoxThe Story of the Three BearsJack the Giant-KillerHenny-PennyChilde RowlandMolly WhuppieThe Red EttinThe Golden ArmTHe History of Tom ThumbMr. FoxLazy JackJohnny-CakeEarl Mar's DaughterMr. MiaccaWhittington and his CatThe Strange VisitorThe Laidly Worm of Spindleston HeughThe Cat and the MouseThe Fish and the RingThe Magpie's NestKate CrackernutsThe Cauld Lad of HiltonThe Ass. the Table and the StickFairy OintmentThe Well of the World's EndMaster of All MastersThe Three Heads of the Well"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"I really can't say I loved it. It was good in parts and than slow and boring in others.  My biggest problem with the book I think has to do with the heroine. Yes. he abandoned her and so on but after he explains his reasons which were understandable you would think that the wife at some point would understand too. but nope.It takes 245 pages for this 2 to actually get together. After they finally get to lie together something else comes up and we have to read another 100 more pages for this women to forgive him again. The story and the idea is not bad the last 40 pages were quit good and romantic but before I reached those I actually struggled to continue reading."
3,"Mallory Edwards married John Barron when she was sixteen. Neither wanted to marry but were forced into the marriage for security for Mallory and by his father on John's part. John leaves Mallory. without consummating the marriage. on their wedding night. Fast forward seven years. their paths cross again when she shows up at a soiree of his latest mistress. John is no longer a young man. pushed around by his father and Mallory is no longer his teenage bride. They literally run away from the soiree due to John's crooked uncle Louis embezzling John's funds and leaving him broke and to a mob of people to whom he owes money. Mallory has lost her home due to not receiving help from her absent husband and she wants a divorce so she can marry an old friend. During their running and hiding. John decides that he will not give Mallory her divorce. but instead lays siege to win her back. Mallory is a tough woman though and she puts John through misery in more than one way."
3,"This book was my least favorite of the series. It was lacking detail in the beginning and the heroine's purpose seemed too manufactured to me. I also couldn't get my head wrapped around the alternating first and third person accounts chapter to chapter. The static characters were a little too static for me (there could have been a little more explanation for some of the behaviors or snootier snubs. And none of them ever really seemed to be resolved).The ending seemed a little scraped together as well. Having already read others in the series. I know this is just a fluke. I will say I liked the characters though. in better development of their back stories or resolutions I would have been more apt to give four stars. Still. it was a decent read. But not one I would be in a hurry to re-read."
3,"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise. this will be the one I end up subscribing to. If you are a Longhorn nut like myself. I'd like to suggest the 'Burnt Orange Nation' blog for your Kindle. It has numerous daily blogs which many are lengthy - sent daily (sometimes several times a day) to your Kindle and keeps you right on top of the Longhorn happenings."
3,"I was going to give four stars. but this newspaper and the subscription experience really couldn't be any better.  My expectations were low based on old reviews. but it looks like everything is worked out now.  There are sufficient graphics. plenty of good content. with the bylines you'd expect.  Okay. cartoons. comics. and crosswords would be nice. but I can forgive the omission.  In fairness. I've only been reading the paper for a few days. so maybe there will be delivery problems in my future.  If so. I'll update this review.  But so far so good.  I'm considering a move to Austin. and I expect to learn a lot about the area by reading the local paper.  This is a really good small newspaper."
3,"As I say in the title. I'm new to Analog having subscribed to it only by Kindle. I'm loving it. I had no idea the Kindle version was more expensive than the print version. While I find this curious. I don't have a preexisting view of a fair price for this magazine. As such. I think the $2.99 per month with instant delivery to a much more pleasant reading format (Kindly versus paper). I'm pretty happy.My delight in Analog is a credit both to the magazine and to the Kindle. I'm thoroughly loving this."
3,"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison. TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month. and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre."
3,"I read both Ellery Queen and Alfred Hitchcock magazines. and I greatly prefer the former.  Consistently strong entries from Clark Howard. Doug Allyn. and other short story powerhouses really make this magazine a pleasure.  I travel for business. and short stories are a perfect entertainment - well-written enough to really hold my interest. but short enough to complete during the shorter periods of time I have available for reading.  And. I particularly love that this publication is now available for the Kindle.  Fantastic."
3,"This magazine  gave me my 1st introduction to this genre of story.  I figured it was better to read a magazine dedicated to mysteries and suspense to get my 1st taste than to spend eight or ten dollars on a book that I may or may not end up liking.  I was not disappointed.  The stories I read were 1st rate and moved along at good pace rather than some books I've read that get so bogged down in details that it seems like it takes forever for the author to finally get around to revealing the plot of the story.  If you like mystery and suspense fiction then I would recommend this magazine.  If you're like I was and a stranger to the genre and just want to get your feet wet to see whether or not it's your cup-o-tea then I also recommend this magazine."
3,"I have become a big fan of this e-magazine. along with the Hitchcock. Asimov and Analog mags. You can't ask for better escapism on your Kindle. My long que of books to read are gathering dust due to my new fondness for short fiction stories. Can't go wrong for the price if you enjoy reading. My only gripe is not being able to view the cover in color on my Kindle. Guess I'll need to buy the new Kindle Fire for that. If you like mysteries. detective stories. etc.. you'll enjoy EQMM. If nothing else. try the 14 day free trial and find out for yourself."
3,"When I used to go to Europe I would seek out a copy of the International Herald Tribune every morning. and usually read it from cover to cover. It simply was a superior newspaper. covering not only USA news but world news. business. sports. etc. Coming back home I would actually feel a sense of loss at having to read our local paper.So I was thrilled when the Kindle edition of the International Herald Tribune came out and I immediately subscribed. The IHT is as good as ever. Excellent. well written articles. In-depth analysis of world events. It's all there. My advice: try the trial subscription for two weeks; I bet you end up cancelling the Times. etc.. and go with the International Herald Tribune."
3,"I have read most of this author's books. I simply love. love. love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each. in their own right. riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly. there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed. no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again. I love. love. love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too."
3,"I love this series. The Westmoreland' s are a beautiful family. Each Westmoreland story is romantic. selfless. family oriented. and so full of love. I love Brenda Jackson's love stories. ( if you can call them that. because to me they are equally about family bonds)but. she does get a little repetitive with wording her love making scenes. I would still give her 5 stars on the story writing because I do love her take on romance. however. the editing of this five book set was awful. Need to use a better editor."
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
3,"I LOVE BELLE ANDRE!!!!  Let me start by saying that I truly truly enjoy reading Belle Andre books.  Yet this one fell short.  Usually I can sit down with my pot of coffee on a Saturday and Sunday morning soaking up the romance that drips from the pages and by Sunday evening. I'm sorry that I read it so fast and want more. The story just didn't make sense to me.  I had a really hard to time getting into the characters.  It was steamy but usually Belle Andre has me with the love story and the steam is the bonus.  This one not so much."
3,"I love Bella Andre and cannot wait for more of the Sullivan's...she promised that this summer she would continue with the series....I have read them all twice and will read them all again....The Sullivan men are so handsome and such regal gentlemen....a woman loves to believe that there is really a man out there that is just like them...Rich and yet honorable and so sexy and so understanding...they actually can feel what they're loved one is going through and doesn't make her wrong and always strives to make it right and wonderul...of course the &#34;sex&#34; scenes are amazing and yet so believable....Ms. Andre. I am waiting for more of your wonderful and talented imagination to be put in print..."
3,"I started these in the order they were written. not that it matters. just my choice.  Each one was better than the one before.  I don't like to divulge too much info as it spoils the read sometimes.  The brief descriptions give me enough to go on as to whether I want to read a book or not.  These were really page turners and just when you thought you knew. you were wrong...or were you.  I really enjoyed these and look forward to more."
3,"Just finished reading all of Kava's books; they were very good!  I am not a book critic; but what I can say is the entire lot of her books were entertaining and held my interest.  Anytime I pick up a book and read instead of doing something else in my free time is saying something!  Kava. Garnder. Gerritssen. Gagnon what a list of great reads for anyone that enjoys these types of stories....And the bundle provieds the ability to acquire six of her books for a good price!"
3,"And I don't know how many more times I will read it. One thing is for certain this author could write the phone book and it would be a runaway best seller. I started reading the McKettricks sagas starting in the 1800 with Angus McKettrich and have loved them all. The writing is excellent the characters are described with a depth few authors are able to describe characters  with. For some reason in this three part series starting with Rance in 'McKettrick's Pride'. Jesse in 'McKettrick's luck and finally Keegan in 'McKettrick's Heart'' Keegan's character grips your heart. his pain becomes your pain and when joy finally finds him it becomes your joy. I have enjoyed getting to know them all but for some reason Keegan has stayed in my heart."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
3,"I've always like the Reader's Digest for a good blend of writing from humor to drama. having subscribed to the print version a number of times off and on over the years.  The actual content quality has always remained consistently high for this publication.It does seem the print version has become overloaded with ads. but that was less of a problem than the annoying cardboard insert/tear-out ads that make the thing physically difficult to read.The Kindle version is a very much improved experience over the print version. with the same high quality writing. of course.  A bonus is that the linked navigation makes it really easy to find an article for the mood I'm in at a given moment."
3,"I am a new Kindle user and downloaded my first issue of Reader's digest and was simply delighted with it!  I read it from cover to cover over a few days time which I have never done in the hard copy of the magazine.  I love that there are no ads and found it easy to navigate between the articles and features.  Thanks Kindle and Reader's digest!Its a few months later and I am updating that I still LOVE this magazine in Kindle format. I have seen a few people complain about not getting their back issues but I have no trouble at all with it. I had been off for a few weeks and when I returned I went to my Manage my Kindle on Amazon and there was a down arrow where I could select which issue I wanted to download so I selected both I had not read and voila! Both are on my Kindle now for me to read.  No problems at all.  Enjoy the magazine!"
3,"The New York Times-Latest News is a great buy. It gets updated during the day and you can virtually have a morning and an evening edition of the news. It is.obviously.an abbreviated version of the newspaper and does not include any of the other sections of the newspaper (like Science Times.Arts and Leisure etc;). It does however have detailed analysis and reporting of the day's main headlines. The table of contents runs 5-6 pages and each news article runs 3-4 pages on the Kindle making it a quick but satisfying read.If you don't have the time or inclination to read an entire newspaper then The New York Times-Latest News is for you-- and at a sweet price of $1.99 a month it is one of those deals where you get MORE than what you pay for !"
3,"This is the first book in the Heroes of Silver Springs. I totally loved this book. I couldn't put it down once I started it. I loved how these two people came back together after years of being apart. I must admit it made me think of the guy I was crushing on when I was in High School wondering what he thought of me. LOL. I loved how Veronica has become her own woman and has decided to do what she wants and feels like doing instead of what others expect of her and want her to do. I loved how she was able to knock Dean off balance from the beginning. I really enjoyed watching these two people learn about each other and fall in love. I think that this is going to be a great series to read because I know that if the rest of the series is as good as this one then we are in for a treat!"
3,"This is first story in the series Robert St.Clare is given a gift of a slave girl for the two weeks he will be visiting there.When she is brought to him the first night he finds she is an English girl and he knows her father. They have sex and more sex every night while they are being watched through peep holes. He wants to take her home with him but it is hard to talk and make plans with everyone listening. They do get to leave together you are not sure at first if it will happen. They have a brief seperation but the HEA does happen. Each story will be the man telling how he met his wife.A very enjoyable series. If you are some one who likes a like of sex in your stories you will certainly find it here."
3,"Ok. I know it's free and shouldn't complain... but sometimes I just can't help myself. Does that make me a bad person? No. just an honest one.  At first It was ok....not bad. but then I signed up for some REAL blogs and discovered that yes...BAD. and getting worse! It's a waste of my time to read about a cooking utensil for something I will never cook or a designer's clothes I will never be able to afford.  There are occasionally some info on books. but I can certainly find that on my own.  Seriously. kitchen utensils. what the celebrities wore at a concert and Korean cooking(which is quite frequently blogged about) are not things that I will miss after canceling my &#34;subscription&#34;.  But hey. That's just me!DawnBee &#60;3(you get what you pay for)"
3,"Can't imagine any Kindle owner not signing on for this freebie info source.  You get light. fast news items. quickie feature pieces. meaty author interviews. and goofy pictures of lava lamps and trendy adult beverages.  Fun stuff all.  Even the rhapsodic essays about failed. discontinued automobiles like the Gremlin and the Pacer (inexplicably. a regular feature) are growing on me.Even if you bought your Kindle just to read e-books and not get news and features (not me... I like everything the Kindle offers). sign up for this free blog generously offered by the Amazon powers-that-be.  At the very least. you'll enjoy the many book suggestions 'Amazon Daily' will send your way.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation and functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals. so as this review gets older. it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product."
3,"One cent per month? Ok. I bit.I'm glad I did. Updated several times a day (whenever they feel like blogging) on a wide variety of subjects. The other day an article was about an early 1970s car. and how it influenced later models. etc. We had thoughts on the Grammy Awards. recipes. new devices. book reviews. on and on.Previously. I would turn the Whispernet (or whatever it is called) off in the morning after receiving my newspapers. Now. I tend to leave it on all day so I can enjoy (or skip. as the case may be) any new Amazon blog.Why not five stars? Due to the presence. in many articles. of links for you to click: IF you were on a computer. Since the Kindle will not follow those links. they are a bit intrusive at times.UPDATE: Now its free? Heck. why not."
3,"This is the third time in a month that my Amazon Daily hasn't been delivered to my Kindle. I haven't had an update since July 23. but I've received new material in the form of a new book I ordered and two samples today. Yes. of course I had turned my Kindle net connection on.What's up? I know the blog has been updated on the website.This kind of thing makes me reluctant to subscribe to other Kindle blogs. ones that aren't free. This was an experiment and so far. I'm discouraged.update: The blog is started with a free trial. and at the end of the free trial. updates stop. Since it is a free blog. one would think that it would just continue to be delivered. or at least that there would be a notice to sign up for future copies. But no. However. I tried an experiment and signed up again for the blog and it's delivered every day [almost] now."
3,"Whoever wrote the synopsis of the story did not read it.  She wasn't trying to drive him away with sweetness.  She really was sweet.  Though apparently not to sweet to casually give away her virginity.  But give her credit she is smart enough not to mention it to him and get away with it.  No real point to telling him.  I know some readers felt that she should have remained a virgin because of the time period.  But unfortunately girls have been talked out of it by the wrong guy throughout history.  Nothing new on that front.  Anyway still a pretty good story."
3,"Thank God this was free because it was so terrible. 1. Heroine meets hero 10 seconds later they are declaring they have feelings for each other and they have sex (she of course a virgin) 2. They then decide to go back to his Dragon lair after the heroines mother who is perfectly ok with it because what mother wouldn't be perfectly okay with it? 3. Then when they get to the lair there is this weird rule where she has to marry two men and that man falls in love the next day with her (mom is okay with this too bc mama Dragon told her it was the way things were)and they have some boring m/f/m sex..this is all intertwined with the dragons of course and that is also rather boring. All in all hated it."
3,"This book actually had a pretty interesting and not so common storyline regarding the dragon/knight subject matter. I was very excited to see some spicy love story mixed into this interesting world created by the author and was even happier when she threw in the man&egrave;ge as part of the love story... This is also actually where she lost me :-/. Unfortunately Lars was introduced and then quickly incorporated into the relationship without much of a separate set up and that bothered me. I think I would have liked equal time between the two husbands and the emotional havoc it caused for this to be a higher rated book."
3,"Within minutes of meeting each other the two main characters are having sex. graphically.  And then it gets worse from there.The plot could have been good if it wasn't turned into a porno.  A naive young woman meets a dashing knight who rides a dragon.  The woman has the unique ability to speak to dragons and joins the companions at their new base of operations.The main characters happen to be married within weeks of meeting after numerous sexual encounters between her new husband. his dragon and her other new husband.  The narration then documents the continual mating of the dragons and the humans over and over and over again.This book is not appropriate for teens and I would recommend any squeamish adults stay away from it as well."
3,"I've enjoyed several of Ms. D'arc's other books so decided to try this series.  I'm definitely enjoying it!The idea of having the dragons mating tied to the knights finding a mate is a great idea. The world building is great. including the idea of a dragon society where humans and dragons work together to successfully and peacefully exist is wonderful!I did think the meet and have sex aspect was a little too rushed but. since this is: a short read; a different society and the author explained the love at first sight thing - it's okay.I liked the action and was eagerly rushing to read the next book - Border Lair.  I do not like the fact that some of the sub-story books have not been published yet but I guess I have to be patient."
3,"Wow dragons!! Knights!! and Mistress' oh my. smiles I loved it!! A great blend of characters and story line. I just had fun reading this. A bit sassy girl meets a dragon and a Knight and in one day is swept off her feet. I loved the action it was fast paced. The sex was hot. the element that the pleasure of the riders and the best are intertwined. Wait did I mention the sex scenes were hot!! smiles again. A awesome tale that made you want to continue to read and a wee bit sad when you were done. Garath and Lars played the story of mellowing bel very well. Makes one think who played who. Did I mention dragon sex?? along with magic. The Mama dragon is soo endearing you cant help but love her. Its a good thing she has more books in this series. Enjoy"
3,"This is the first book in a series that has 5 books so far.  That's not obvious when trying to purchase on Amazon but if you go to the author's website first you can figure it out.  I read this book 3rd (read book 5 then 3 because she changes the series names for no reason).  Even though I know what was going to happen I enjoyed the story.  I did find it a bit abrupt.  With it being book one more explanation could have been done.  If I hadn't read the other books first I wouldn't have understood the customs. and the reasons for them.  With this being book one. the foundations for the story could have been better done."
3,"I bought this on a lark one day not expecting much but oh how wrong I was - I bought every other book that was available that day and while anxiously awaiting any new ones to be released have re-read them all again. I write this in response to a post on the authors blog that she wrote showing the horrible reviews this book got.. Well I felt that I had to let her know that I am one very happy customer and once I bought this series I went on to purchase all of the Brotherhood of the Blood (Vampire Tales) books along with the Tales of the Ware.. which I also love. I rarely write reviews. but I just have to ask what book or books those other people were reading because it sure wasn't this one. Happy writing Ms. D Arc I already have the next two books in the Dragon Knight series on pre-order and keep checking your website for updates on when the next Tales of the Ware are coming out -Thank you !"
3,"All my preferred stories have a nice. moderately robust plot.  This book by D'Arc promised paranormal/fantasy as well as erotica.  There is some romance. but there is a great del of lust and frequent close encounters.  The action starts very early in the book. and I was slightly disappointed when I felt that more of a lead-in would have tied the story together neatly.  Stick with it.  The storyline is new. and the inception is interesting.  If you can appreciate the emotions and actions often connected with erotica. you will enjoy this new offering.  M&eacute;nage of the male/female/male variety is present as well as more traditional one-on-one. and the author even includes the non-human characters."
3,"My first introduction to this author was her Brotherhood of the Blood novels which are absolutely remarkable.  I think the things that turned off other readers was that the type of erotica in this book was unexpected.  Threesomes are more often in her writing than a monogamist relationship.  You have to have an open mind to truly get everything you can from her work.  I think with this novel you also need a healthy dose of imagination.  Don't read any of her work if you don't have open mind and definitely don't read this book if you don't have an imagination.  I. for one. haven't met a book of hers that I didn't like....this is no exception."
3,"I enjoyed the book and the characters I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because I too feel that the author could have backed off a little with all the erotica. The story line is a good one but needs to be developed more. Some reviews were complaining about the link between rider. dragon and sex. If anyone who has read the' Dragonriders of Pern' series would know this has already been established in Dragon fantasy lore. However where as the Pern series down plays the sexual side of the relationships Maiden Flight is in your face erotica. I do agree there needs to be a warning that this is an ADULT dragon fantasy novel  and not for young adults.  The series has great promise and I'm hoping that the next book goes more into the story line with a little sex thrown it ;)"
3,"Plot:When Jake collapsed on her doorstep. Sera knew she finally had to confront their past. What she didn't expect was a night of hot healing loving would fix it all.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (psychic) erotic romance.- 1166 kindle locations. 15000 words (but finishes around 1020 locations).- m/f - explicit. sufficiently frequent. loving.- Includes an excerpt from 'Believe the Magic' by Melani Blazer.Opinion:A nice novella with a strong story and plenty of sweet lovin'. Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
3,"This was a short super quick read. I didn't find it as bad as some of the reviewers here have stated. I think it was fine for what it was. I agree had the story been longer there may have been more interesting and enticing scenes. I would have liked to learn a little more about Sera and her gifts.The entire time I was reading it I kept thinking back to Linda Howards White Out which can be found in Strangers in the Night. The premise seemed similar. Being snowed in but Howards was more of a story. I really enjoyed that one. There was at least one similar scene that while both were good this fell a little short.All in all I liked it. Could there have been more? Of course. but they can't all be novels."
3,"I was disappointed with this story. In and of itself. it was ok if all you want to read about is one weekend of sex between 2 and 3 people. but the story part was lacking. Just as things get to a point where the story could be further developed. it ends. The whole thing could have been longer and more fleshed out. It took me maybe 45 minutes to read this book. For the price. it wasn't worth it.Wade is just kinda thrown in so that there is a 3rd person for the Menage part. and it's hardly believable. He's in love with another woman but it's ok to have sex with someone you don't know?"
3,"Reviewed by Donna B. at You Gotta Read Reviews - A sweet taste of the forbidden. both arousing and potent. ensnares Angie as her boss entices her to spend Christmas at his house. in his bed.  As she falls for his overwhelming charms. they are both surprised by the early arrival of his holiday houseguest.  Ryan has always shared with his best friend. Wade. but as Wade sets his sights on Angie. Ryan begins to realize that sometimes. it's better to act like Scrooge.Mackenzie McKade has spun an explicitly erotic tale of wicked. wanton acts and turned it into a heartwarming romance.  Her descriptions are vivid and clear. her characters have chemistry in spades. and the tale is sexy as sin in Bound for the Holidays."
3,"If you are looking for some heat this holiday season then this short story will warm you up. What could be the worst thing to do at the company Christmas party? Go home with the boss. But heck. Angela knows she's good and she can find another job and Ryan is utterly delicious. But when she agreed to go home with him she wasn't expecting that he'd have his best friend there.Of course Ryan didn't expect it either. Wade is ruggedly handsome. a cowboy. Ryan is sophisticated model good looking. I mean... what more can a girl ask for Christmas? I'd say she was a good girl this year!Ryan has never had a problem sharing women with Wade in the past but something about Angie wakes every possessive instinctive.This story is short and it is an erotica story so there's a lot of sex and not a lot of the actual storyline so if you're looking for something hot then this will be for you.Toe Curling Rating: 4"
3,"This book was below average. There was no build up to Angie and Ryan. He says 'come home with me' and she agrees. When Wade was added it seemed too easy. Angie didn't question him or ask about him just jumped right in. I disliked Wade because if he got his heart broke why was he jumping into a threesome. Ryan couldn't voice his jealousy about Wade with Angie. Angie blindly went along with everything and didn't show a mind of her own. The sex scenes were good and the only reason I gave it three stars. The end felt like the author  gave up on her characters. It ended just as quick as it all began. There was no plot only sex which doesn't normally bother me but this was so unreal. It felt fake from beginning to end."
3,"Angie was expecting to spend a lonely Christmas all by herself until she shares some unexpected time with sexy boss Ryan Tyler at the Christmas party.  When he asks her to come home with him. she jumps at the chance.  It isn't until he is ready to leave the party that Ryan remembers he really is having company - his pal Wade.  They have shared many women in the past. maybe they will share Angie too.When Angie and Ryan arrive at his house. they can't keep their hands off each other.  A knock at the door interrupts them. and Wade is suddenly on the scene.  For the first time in his life. Ryan has to face unfamiliar feelings. and the fact that he doesn't want to share Angie.This is a very erotic sexy story.  The chemistry between Angie and Ryan is to die for."
3,"As a stand-along book. I really enjoyed The Twelve Lies of Christmas. although it didn't have as much of a holiday theme as the title would indicate.The main characters were engaging. if a bit under-developed and the story was fast-paced and kept my interest throughout the story. The one issue I had with the story is that since it's a prequel to the Sophie Green series. I'd expect to read something in the story to interest me in the series. I really didn't. Sophie was a minor footnote at the end. On the other hand. I would be very interested in reading more about Nate & Samantha. I can't imagine that their lives would become less exciting that they started in this book."
3,"I was expecting a whole lot more from this author as I have enjoyed her previous books.  This book was just too short and the characters were not developed enough.  Also I was expecting a christmas theme and the only part of christmas was that none of the characters celebrate christmas and so christmas day is just another day to them.  Hard to swallow that a con artist and a spy could immediately trust and fall into bed with each other and live happily ever after.  I was glad that I borrowed this instead of paid money for this as it was not worth either my time nor my money"
3,"I liked the Joker's Wild series...but this was my least favorite out of the three. All of the guys in these stories have 'issues' (who doesn't? LOL) but the main character here seemed rather disconnected. critical and just an odd man. Brody is described as drop dead gorgeous while Missy is a self-conscious. 'larger.' woman a few years Brody's junior. The point about Brody being upset when Missy would make fun of herself and Brody's refusal to deal with it was mentioned so many times I grew tired of it. And I never really 'got' why these two people became a couple. This one had less romantic attraction (in the beginning) than the other two in the series--it was more based on sexual attraction. But I still found the great writing style. interesting plot lines and interweaving with the other books in the series.This is worth reading. just read Three Nights and Call Me first!"
3,"I loved the first and the last book in this series. I thought the second book was much to heavy and the Chris and Eliza didn't have nearly as much fun as Kayla/Dylan and Missy/Brody did. I found myself laughing at loud at some of their antics and hot and bothered at most of the love scenes. As a plus-size woman I can truly understand her insecurities and though Brody was a handful I think he handled them fine. As someone who loves a domineering man I didn't have a problem with his heavy-handedness.This was a quick read for me and I will be revisiting this story again. You can't go wrong by adding this book to your library!"
3,"The day (Friday) before AJ is set to marry Kyle. she finds out her ex Cooper is going to be at the wedding.  Cooper is having trouble accepting that AJ has moved on. but plans to go to the wedding for closure.  Cooper's is a very distant relative to a god. Eros. who is bored and decides to complicate AJ and Cooper's lives.  Eros makes it where AJ and Cooper repeat Friday over and over again.  For a week solid they are repeating this day over.  AJ and Cooper are still very much in love. but are fighting it.This book kept me very entertained!  I got a total kick out of the bored got Eros.Great light read for everyone to read!"
3,"This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
3,"This was really fun read. It was also hot! It's Valentine's Day the day before your wedding and you find out the ex you really haven't got over is coming to the wedding looking for closure. but it causes old feelings to stir up for both of you. The morning of your wedding you wake up and it's Valentine's Day all over again. This happens to AJ and Cooper they relive the same day over and over again. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you relive a day over and over again. Will they grab this second chance at love?"
3,"I really like the stories I have read by this author. but this was my least favorite so far.  I usually really like this author and was disappointed by the book because it was just okay.  They story had a very interesting premise. but it was not fleshed out into the full story it deserved.  The shortness of the story makes Aislinn's capitulation a little too quick even though you know they have been working together for 6 months already. I would love to see this story worked out into a full novel by this author and see where it really goes.  It felt overly edited to fit within a certain number of pages.I will keep reading her books. but I just won't revisit this one."
3,"Novellas are not my favorite but I like Annmarie. so I thought I'd try it and I loved it.Whly? I have a storyline. a plot. a h and H.I know why Aislinn has an issue with trusting men.I know what Kyle has on his mind and I know what happens.How could I not love it!  Great story. yes longer would have been better but. it wasn't just sex. I got a story - I'm happy!And I know that The Strength of Three is the follow-up book with her friend Christina's story. fantastic!"
3,"We're very naive people because of living in a powerful. strong country but things could happen here in the U.S. as they do in other countries.  Jack Shane gives us a good look at what could occur.  Again Gary Weir of the CIA over rides those stupid people in the Pentagon that want to disband Bobby Autry's team because they're too good at what they do (hard to imagine).  The World Leaders are meeting in LA for 2 days and some group of agitators don't like it.  Bobby Autry's team is called in by Weir for help; every body get's shot up even Weir but he is considered one of Autry's team who end up saving his life along with the President. other world leaders. etc.  A fun Read. Again by Shane and it makes you think and come out of your 'La.La land'.  Cliff Mitts"
3,"Allan Quatermain is the final adventure of that hero as penned by the magnificent H. Rider Haggard.The beginning may the best I've ever read.  Who else but Haggard would start a story with the death of the main character's only child.  There is an amazing battle as well.The middle dragged pretty heavily for me.  However. that was redeemed by a thrilling finale.  Umslopogaas is a character that reaches out and grabs you. and his finale suited him well.  I have to think he was one of Haggard's favorite characters.Grab the free Kindle version. and you won't regret it."
3,"I enjoy when the main characters have a long history together.  This was the case in this novel.  I also enoyed the correspondence (through the use of letters) between the main characters.  It was a nice way to communicate the story in the first third of the novel.  With that being said. this novel added nothing else new to the romance genre.  The plot was a bit predictable and the ending was (as always) wrapped up perfectly in a nice neat bow.  Not too realistic.  But if you are looking for an easy beach read. this one is for you!"
3,"This is a cute little quick and I mean quick story. The plot or concept are 2 people writing each other and falling in love.  i must admit in the beginning the author includes the letters that they are writing each other.  For me it got a little annoying but it doesn't matter. Sean was crazy sexy and I loved Eve's personality. If you are the type that wants to feel connected to the characters on some deep level then this might not be for you as it's fast paste. The sex is a thumps up it was quick but still a thumps up."
3,"Eve Carmichael writes letters to co-worker Sean O'Callahan. stationed in Iraq as a reservist.  Their letters become sexier & sexier until she doesn't hear from him for 3 weeks & she's very worried.  Her best friend takes her to &#34;Male Call&#34;. a Chippendales-like show for her 30th birthday.  Sean surprises her as he performs with the male dancers.  Hoo- Rah!!!!  They get married & are very happy!!  Who wouldn't want their sexy guy to do a striptease for them!!!!!!  GREAT STORY!!!"
3,"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie and since it was short. I read it in between other books in my TBR list. It was just okay on all counts - as erotica. it was passable; the plot wasn't exciting. but I did make it through to the end (although there wasn't really a burning need to); the characterization was okay - if the author had fleshed out her characters more. and improved the dialogue. it would've made a better book. There was some heat to it. and some of it was written pretty well. so that helped move the story along a little more than it would have otherwise. Since I did finish it to the end. and didn't hate it. I rated it as a 2.5. rounded up to 3."
3,"Yes. much of this story (as with others in the Hot Zone series) is superficial and silly - old fashioned letter writing. suddenly falling in love with the computer geek from work. the entire scene at the male strip club. etc. But. that's kind of the fun of these stories. Personally. I'm a sucker for a hot military hero or cowboy romance. and Male Call (despite the awful pun) reeled me in. For an hour or so worth of reading. this story is definitely enjoyable."
3,"A very short story; I guess it's a novella but I didn't think it would be.  Also. not enough story. mostly sexual encounters - but then. it's that genre.  They're not great for story.Cord Daily has loved and wanted Cait Culver as long as he can remember. but her father threatened him then sent her to Paris for two years.  Now. she's back - and Cord takes the opportunity. with his cousin Dalton. to have a night with her.  He never knew that she wanted him. too.  But then her father finds out that Cord is now the owner of a race horse Mr. Culver wants.  Cait gets the absolutely wrong impression  - but Cord finds a way to make it right."
3,"9.99 for four stories sounds really good only problem is that the stories aren't good. I'm a fan of Lori Foster. I have loved some of her other books. but I can't even force myself to finish this one. I'm in the middle of story 3 and I just can't make myself care about the characters enough to keep reading. This will not be my last book by her but it will take a while for me to kindle another one by her.I first rated this bundle 2 stars but after going back and reading the last story I added a star. The last story I really like. maybe it's just story 3 and 4 that need a little help"
3,"The story was great. the printing format was terrible. It was very disconcerting to be reading and all of a sudden. the chapter would end without finishing the thought or the sentence; sometimes even the word wasn't finished. It just left one hanging and wondering what was supposed to been said or what was happening. Then the next chapter would start and you never knew what the heck was going on.. This happened at  the end of at least 10 chapters. It kept  breaking my concentration and frustrating me so much. it interfered with trying to enjoy the book.  I would like to try this book again sometime if it was edited and corrected."
3,"There are. perhaps. a few places where the characters' past history and current personalities might not stand up to close scrutiny -- but the turns of phrase are quite deft. and the characters are simply _fun._ so I'm not inclined to quibble. The faintest besmirching of the overall entertainment is a duel which has a slight jump and feel of 'insert duel here' in the author's notes. but that's the only part which got my mind hiccuping.The other reviews cover details quite well enough. and the bits that I really. really liked. I can't say or it'll spoil the snickers. (There is quite a fair dose of humor here and there!) Unfortunately. the first of those is just _after_ the sample text ends."
3,"I already liked the cheeky hero from reading about him in the first book. An Inconvenient Duchess. Always love a bad boy! What makes this story so funny to me is him trying his best to stay out of the heroine's clutches (well. not really clutches) and maintaining his honor.  It is quite the turn around from a rakish hellion!  I started and finished the story in one day - it is a quick - but satisfying - read.  It flows smoothly and has just enough tension.  It isn't deep but it is good and I'm heading out to find more of her stories!"
3,"Esme is abused by her father after her mother leaves them.  Seeking a way out she is going to marry until she realizes the man is just as awful (and as old as) her father.  When she witnesses the scene across the street she decides that Captain Radwell is the man to ruin her and get her away from her father.  What she doesn't count on is the honorable streak that he is trying to have.  He delivers her to his brother and his wife for help.  And then he sticks around.  Great read!"
3,"All in all a great read. I would have given this book five stars except there were some repetitive thought processes in the beginning that had me saying 'alright already - I get it... he wants to stay but he's afraid she'll recognize him and reject him or turn him in'. (reminders would have been okay. but perhaps less wordy ones) However. by nearly half way in the book it moves away from that. There's plenty of action and suspense throughout. and a nice romance to boot."
3,"The summary seemed cute and interesting and the story is...until you meet Stacy. This is a heroine you want to like after you hear of her past and her heroic actions but then it's near impossible to like her.Gina Wilkins had potential in this story but it gets weighted down and just plain eye-rolling when it you have an extremely Stacy not even trying while Jake is giving and showing just how nice of a man he is.Ms. Wilkins emasculates Jake Hinson completely turning him into Stacy Carter's new dog...simpering. whimpering and pleading for Stacy to throw him a bone. Oscar the Yorkie disappears and Ms. Wilkins makes Jake his replacement in a quick transition.I definitely won't ever read another Gina Wilkins book if this is the way she writes her men."
3,"I love Susan Mallery's more recent books (try the Fool's Gold series) so when I saw older books had been rereleased. I had to buy it. I was really happy I bought parts 1 & 2 at the same time. so I didn't have to pause between books. You don't have to read them in order. the books can all stand alone. but you will understand the dynamics better if you do. And if you love stories about people finding the loves of their lives. you will love this series."
3,"These four books are some of Crusie's earlier books so they are shorter than most of her newer novels and the plotlines are not quite as well developed but her trademark humor and loveable characters are present in spades! These books are all great summer reads and at $10 for the set this is a steal!I think 'Getting Rid of Bradley' is by far the best of the four followed by 'Strange Bedpersons' and 'Charlie All Night'. 'What the Lady Wants' is the weakest of the four in my opinion but it is still very readable.Enjoy!"
3,"I do agree that I would like to have spent more time with these characters. I was very bummed when it just ended. and i do agree it could have used more depth. But I really loved these characters. For what they were. in the length given. they popped. Book reads very much like a brilliant fantasy. Like all her stories so far. the story has a sweet quality to it. but very hot. I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was and look forward to more from this author."
3,"I own this book in paperback- and spent more than what the on line/download price that's for sure. And what they are asking for now is about how much I think it's probably worth.It's not one I re-read. The stories go by so quick. there's no time to get involved in the characters or feel for them at all. The one story I halfway got into- the honeymoon/castaway story- I ended up wondering how things work out for them- wished it was it's own book."
3,"Just finished the second book &#8220;View To Kill&#8221; in this very sensational storyline. what can you say about characters that are so well written that they grab you from the beginning and not let go even after the story is finished.  This story maybe short but it is a joy to read. to devour and not want the story to end. the character of Sachin was terrific. he saved her. watched her as she matured into a fantastic women. and how he loves her. he definitely has a wonderful match in Paige. a perfect pair."
3,"This was a great follow up to King of Prey. The main character in this is the right hand man of the King of Hawks. Sachin meets his mate when she is to young to claim but he continues to visit her as she grows up. After mistakes are made and trust is lost Sachin must figure out what he wants and how to hang on to it.I liked how this book went with a different approach to how the main characters meet and their relationship progresses. There was no instant love with them flying off into the sunset. It was a more real love with a undeniable passion between the two that is common in the paranormal romances. I enjoyed following both characters and learning about them. their pasts and their futures.Again I love this series and so far out of all the books this one was my favorite. I definitely recommend this to fans of Paranormal Romance or shifter stories.*I received this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review.*"
3,"Dee Knight had a really great story line here that could have yielded a fantastic book. This is a sweet story. She did a great job with the characters. I would have loved to see her expand it. The sex is too short. the scenes are too short. It's difficult to get worked up about anything that happens in the story. I'd love to see her rewrite it and lengthen it out!(71 pages per Amazon. but a lot of excerpts from other Samhain Publishing are included.  This publisher has may favorite author Lorelei James.)"
3,"K.A. Mitchell is my favorite M/M author. her ability to create realistic characters is amazing.  I love that in this story both men would be what I would call Alpha types. even though it's primarily Jeff in charge. Ryan also steps up.  Very realistic storyline. Jeff can't let out that he's gay for fear of losing the time he has with his daughter. Ryan was in the Air Force so he's been in that same scenario where he has to hide that part of him. The sex scenes this author writes are incredibly descriptive & erotic; makes me feel a little like a voyeur!I do agree with the other reviewers that the book does end abruptly and hope the story is continued.What I didn't like: 2/3 of the book is the story. the last 1/3 of the kindle book is advertisements for other books to read/buy.  So very short story. but still a great quick read that I feel was worth the price."
3,"If I hadn't been reading this book on my kindle I would have torn it to pieces! This is one of those books where the villain gleefully tells his soon-to-be victem about his evil plan and. because he took so long gloating. was killed. And the heroine was so pathetic and annoying that I wanted her to die. All of that freezing in fear and fainting. Gag! Not only that. but. for a character who is supposed to be intelligent. she couldn't even figure out who the villain was when he was standing in front of her with a gun pointed at her. There was plenty more that I could complain about. but it annoys me just thinking about it!"
3,"This was actually part of the Dragon Knight series but introduced some characters that would be beneficial to the upcoming books in that series.  If you are looking for hot sex then this has it but it also has a great story line and introduces characters that become common place as the Dragon Knights series progresses.  The young woman in this book was of strong character although a little lost and we actually saw some flaws in the Dragon Knights she becomes involved with.  I liked where the author took this story and look forward to more in this series."
3,"I HAVE NOW READ ALL OF THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES. LOVED EVERYONE OF THEM. THE CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING. I HIGHLEY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES TO ANYONE WHO LOVES ROMANCE. ACTION. SECRETS. SEX. INTRIGUE. I HAVE EVEN PRE-ORDERED THE NEXT BOOK THAT IS DUE OUT IN AUGUST. I CAN'T WAIT. BIANCA D'ARC WRITING IS AMAZING. ONCE I GET THROUGH READING THIS SERIES. I AM GOING TO START READING HER OTHER BOOKS. IF THEY ARE HALF AS GOOD AS THIS SERIES. THEY WILL BE AWSOME. THANK YOU BIANCA FOR GIVING ME A WONDERFUL TIME READING YOUR BOOKS."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
3,"This is Maris Mackenzie's story. She is working as a horse trainer for a prestigious owner in Kentucky and wakes up one morning to find herself in bed with a man she doesn't know. Maris finds herself in the middle of an investigation involving insurance fraud but realizes she's met the man she's going to marry.While Maris' journey to the altar is a short one. what's engaging about the story is when she and Alex MacNeil return to Ruth. Wyoming to meet the MacKenzie clan. It's an opportunity to check in on the other members of the family and watch Alex face the wrath of five brothers who question his motives.It is an entertaining story and any excuse to revisit MacKenzie Mountain makes it worthwhile."
3,"Maris' story is 2 1/2 stars for me. the bump to a half star owing to the gathering of the family at the end. The story. unfortunately. suffers from telling and not showing plot details. The chemistry between Maris and Alex suffers from this as well. The reader is thrown into the present without adequate descriptions of past meetings and attraction between the couple. (The suspenseful aspect to the novel also suffers from this.) Flashback scenes would have helped tremendously. Those familiar with the Mackenzie Family books expect instant attraction between the hero and heroine. but it's just not developed in this one."
3,"Langley never fails to deliver. I love a good shifter tale and this one definitely pleases. Dev is a reluctant hero. rising to the occasion to save his mate. Lainey. from an abusive alpha. Lainey is a spunky. cute. klutz who keeps his handsome mate. and the reader. laughing and groaning in turns at his antics. This fast-paced. sensual story kept me turning pages to find out what happened next. This one has a permanent place on my reader. because once wasn't enough."
3,"From the beginning. this book is charming and funny. Laine's character is quirky. sweet. adorable. and hilarious. His penchant for getting himself into trouble combined with being a total klutz makes this character completely lovable. There are other characters that you fall in love with as well: Grammy. Laine's grandmother. Cole (Dev's best friend) and Cole's mate. Caroline. who. like Laine. has a penchant for getting into trouble and is a complete and total klutz. This story is short yet sweet that I truly enjoyed reading. Laine keeps Dev on his toes with his shenanigans which will keep you giggling throughout the story. This was an enjoyable read.See Kiwi's complete 4 sweet pea review at mrsconditreadsbooks.com/index.php/?p=12096"
3,"I laughed an awful lot reading this book. I loved it! But. then again. I'm a sucker for stories involving a Toppy Top and a Mouthy Bottom.Laine is absolutely adorable. He is the biggest klutz with the worst coordination and driving record on the planet. He says exactly what pops into his head. Devlin is an Alpha looking to relocate his pack. Dev is dominant. sexy. strong. smart and has a great sense of humor. Good thing too since his best friends wife and Laine are both catalysts for disaster.This is a wonderful short read that I truly wish was longer."
3,"This whole 'instantly recognizing your mate' thing -- I TOTALLY LOVE THAT! And the eyes and teeth 'shifting' when emotions run high. very cool!! If you like the genre. you'll like this: family. loyalty. friends. and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action. and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not. if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it."
3,"I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.  J.L.. have you been reading my journal?  LOL...  Really though these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again."
3,"I thought this was a quick read. Or perhaps I liked it soo much. I was able to read it fast. It only took me a few hours if that. It was pretty face paced. I hope to see more of Dev and Laine. I enjoyed it. It jumped right into the action and didn't slow down.Dev is new to town. He and his best friend Cole(and his mate Caroline) are going to be relocating for work. Dev stumbles upon a the local pack assualting there Omega. He get angry and goes to recue him. Laine. the local Omega and doesn't have a filter on his mouth. He says what is on his mind. Both to their joy. they realized early on in the book they are destined to be mates. When the local pack Alpha continues to torment Laine. Dev has to decide what he will do to proctect his new lover/mate."
3,"After reading the sample for this I was disappointed by the rest of it. It seemed like there would be more mature writing and a deeper plot. However. the plot is rather simple and most of the characters feel two dimensional and at times almost annoying. Laine and one of the other characters in particular were weak characters. The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature. Now while this can be a part of a character. no one is perfect after all. there was no depth added to make that clumsy characteristic endearing or to show that Laine could act like more than a teenager. At least the book had more than sex and there was plot progession. but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this story. even for the cheap price. It's short and doesn't really make the reader feel any emotion."
3,"Fans of the 'with' series should recognise the overall wold in this short story.  While this could be read as an unofficial prequel to the series. as these characters are mentioned briefly (though not by name) in Without Reservations. if you are unfamiliar with these novels I would read it after the first full novel.  I enjoyed this one and didn't find Laine irritating like some others did; not everyone can be perfect and it was a nice change from some other shorts I've read.  If you enjoy the series you'll probably like this addition to it as well. I did."
3,"I read the first story in this series and thoroughly enjoyed it. I went on a buying spree and got the other two as well as this short story. I suppose Laine's antics were meant to be comedic relief but I did not laugh not once. His antics were not funny. I did not buy Devlin being so amused by Laine's antics.I was shocked with how they resolved the conflict with Victor. I thought it was a weak plot point. This story was just ok. I wouldn't recommend anyone spending the money to buy it. If it were free. then yes."
3,"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate. Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership."
3,"Lady Amelia has decided to take a lover. Announcing it to her husband over breakfast probably wasn't the way to begin this adventure.Victoria Alexander has a way of making me laugh that no one else does! The antics of this husband and wife are truely hilarious. She really doesn't want a lover - just her husband's attention. He really doesn't want her to take a lover - but he offers to help. They both enlist the help of his twin brother and renowned rake in achieving their true goal.It really is one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time - and Victoria Alexander is always a favorite!"
3,"Very brief story.  Enjoyable but not a lot to it.  The hero and heroine have been married long enough to fall into a rut.  The husband. a twin. has always wondered whether his wife might have preferred his brother (because the twins had swapped places a couple of times during the married couples courtship because the husband has always felt less socially adept than his twin).  The heroine has always been able to tell the difference between the twins and has never doubted she married the twin that she wanted to marry.  Still. they've settled into comfortableness and she wants passion (and she fears her husband may have strayed --though he hasn't).  Over breakfast she makes an outrageous statement about possibly taking a lover. jolting her loving if inattentive  husband into action.Nice story. Loving couple. It's just a short story. however."
3,"This book was not bad at all.  I don't think I've ever read something quite like the plot of this book before.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you like the fantasy or urban fantasy type novels. I think you might like this one.  Be aware that this book has some rather racy bits in it. so I don't think kids should probably read it.  The only problem with this book for me is that it has no chapter demarcations.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how far along a person is in a book and how close a person is to the end of a chapter when he/she needs to find a stopping place at times.  Give it a shot because it might be just a bit of escapist fun for a while.  Have at it!  I liked the characters and I can't wait to read the next one."
3,"I give it five stars.Unbreakable by Sydney Somers is a fantastic action filled story. in the tradition of Buffy The Vampire Slayer that I found almost impossible to put down. The chemistry between the main characters as well as the secondary ones is outstanding.When the story first starts Jordan and her partner / lover Gage are brutally attacked by a war demon and in the process the fatally injured Gage ends up dying in her arms.Fast forward five years into the future. Jordan is still a cop by day but by night she's an a** kicking demon slayer with an attitude! So imagine her anger and hurt when she discovers that Gage didn't really die that night. Instead he's stayed away for the last five years in a misguided attempt to protect her from the shadow demons that she hunts and slays every night.This book is definitely a keeper. If you love stories about demons. heroes. hot sex and a great love that won't be denied then you are sure to love Unbreakable."
3,"I confess that I had read these before. many years ago.  I got a special offer for the Kindle version of all six books at one time and decided it might be nice to revisit.  And it was.  So much so that at the end of the last one I immediately (at 1:00 AM) popped on site and ordered the next six delivered to my Kindle for uninterrupted reading.  I recommend these if you like a good storyline.  There are Vampires and other aspects of the supernatural as well as political aspects. romance and some violence; albeit of the non horrific type.  Read these anytime. daytime or night time.  You won't loose sleep you will gain a desire for the dark."
3,"This series of books had  some of the best Vampire stories I've ever read.  Fast paced. great. lovable characters. and plenty of action. not to mention sexual tension throughout..real page turners.  They made me want to be part of  the &#34;family&#34;!  lol  I want to read the next series. but will probably have to wait till someone gives me a gift card.  The price on the second series is a little prohibitive for me.  On the other hand. these books are definitely worth it. if yo love to read about &#34;lovable vampires&#34;."
3,"This is not my first time reading this collection. I have the paperback copies that I have kept over the years. It is a totally engrossing set of books. Maggie Shayne is one of my favorite paranormal authors. one that I can be sure when I pick up one of her books. I will enjoy it.Wings in the Night. Part 1 contains six wonderful tales about the creatures of the night known as vampires. I read that Maggie's line of vampire stories are the original ones. the ones that came before. You will see they are people just like you and me. You'll fall in love at least once. Maybe more.If you like paranormal romance. get this collection. You won't be disappointed. All I was disappointed in was that I couldn't give it more than five stars. I am looking forward to obtaining more of her books for the Kindle or Nook."
3,"I became attached to the characters. I liked the series for the most part. I only had 2 complaints. The characters kept saying that they weren't monsters. that they are the same people they were before immortality (which I agree). However. the author kept calling it the dark gift. I didn't like that. It's either that they're good people just different or they are dark monsters. You can't be both. The other thing. I'm not sure how to put into words. but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example. Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this. I got the point the 1st 2 times they explained their thoughts and feelings.  For the most part. I liked the series. Just these 2 points bothered me."
3,"The Wings on the Night series is enchanting! This series was the series that led me to Maggie Shayne. who I adore. I fell in love with the vampires from her series & reading this collection only served to deepen that love! I own this entire series. but I jumped on the chance to own this collection on my Kindle app. Part one contains some of my favorite characters - Rihanna. Roland. Tamara. Eric. and list goes on and on! Grab this collection and step into the enchanting stories of the immortal vampire! Embrace the night & fall in love with these amazing characters!P.S. Maggie is getting read to return to these characters in a new series! Catch up one your reading while we wait For the new novels!"
3,"Deidre Nelson is back in Ventura Texas watching over her parent's bedand breakfast while they are away. Jonas Mendez is the town's sheriff.The last time Deidre and Jonas saw each other was to say goodbyebefore Deidre left for New York ten years ago.Ten years is a long time. but the attraction that simmered betweenDeidre and Jonas is as strong as ever and the anticipation of whatmight become of it is even stronger!Anticipation is the perfect title for Jonas and Deidre's story.  Ilove how they got back what they once had. Of course this time. it'sbetter than before!  There is a lot of heat and heart in Anticipation;it's a sexy and very romantic story.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
3,"I tried this book because I wanted something light and happy for this Christmas season.  I was very surprised to find it concerned an older hotel in San Francisco. one of my most favorite cities.  The heroine was a strong woman and she meets a man who is instantly attracted to her.  She is a little klutzy but all sorts of fun.  Personally. I can relate to that. I read this book I one short evening and think you'd enjoy this romance too.  If nothing else. it is a little different from the usual Contemporary Romance.  Happy Reading!"
3,"Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book. and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care. but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!"
3,"Recently stating that I very seldom find a 5 star book. I have now read 2 in a row. Naturally I'm pleased! I have read Stephanie Bond before but nothing as good as this book. Hero is reviewing a hotel recently bought by a big corporation. He stays at the hotel without the manager's. Cindy aka heroine. knowledge. HILARIOUS happenstances start on the first page and continue throughout the book. Cindy is hard working. lovable. and accident prone; but a good hotel manager. Eric (hero) is there to do a hatchet job on the hotel. he's crazy about the heroine and wants to pad the report. but does not. Chemistry is great between the H/h.... naturally needed in a good romance. and the humor is top notch. Great..Great..Read. I highly recommend this book and I thank Ms. Bond for the entertainment."
3,"I have read just about everything this author has written and decided to read this series. even though it seemed to be very raunchy. This book isn't quite as steamy as the first book and I found that I really enjoyed it. I like the way the author develops her characters and I like the way there is no insurmountable misunderstanding. I love the way the H's always fall head over heels for the h's despite not wanting to and despite they are alpha's. I love a good romance and this author always delivers!"
3,"I think I would have really liked this book had it not been the descriptions of size for the male lead.  I mean c'mon!!!!  There really is such a thing as 'too big' and this is up there with HELL NO!  Every time I started to get back into the story and care about the characters here comes another description of 'the cannon'.  It just got to be utterly ridiculous!  And EVERY male is of that proportion?  Not to repeat myself but really. ridiculous!"
3,"So. this book is long. and packed with lots of sex. The story is ok...but it seems to really just be background for sex scene after sex scene. To me. some of the descriptions of the sex went to the cheesey side of sex...rather than the erotic...but it was hot. And the description of his 'cannon' and use of it as a name...really?I guess I only gave it 3 stars because there really could have been more story here. I would have liked for it to have gone on in the end a little as to how it actually ended. To me. it just sorta stopped.So. If you are into hot and heavy steamy sex this is the book for you. If you want story with a side of steamy sex. this may be a bit much."
3,"I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have passed over this book. It just did not look that interesting and it seemed like this was the one and only book written by Samantha Cruise so it cannot be that good. can it?Boy was I ever wrong! This is the most eroctic. most sensual. most passionate. most sexiest. hottest. steamiest. most graphic book I have ever read. Did I say hot. did I say sexy. did I say extremely eroctic. then let me repeat myself again! I am not sure if Samantha Cruise has written any other books and to date I have not been able to find any but I hope she writes more books. This book was so hot that made I left my husband a very happy man! I would highly recommend this book! Great Job Ms. Cruise!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"we all remember our first loves.. not many of us thought it was the forever love of our lives.. we have go through high school thinking we have met the love of our lives till something happens and you can't stand to be in the same room with that person. Payton and Lizzie have that kind of love.. I couldn't put this book down.. he was SO mean to lizzie when he thought that he had to be.. but in the end sometimes you hurt the people/person that you love the most..i can't wait to see if there will be other books by this author.. if they are anything like 'the heart will lead you home' i would buy it in a second.. you won't regret this book purchase.."
3,"The first three of these books fit together wonderfully as the opening trilogy of the John Carter of Mars series.  For pure fantasy adventure. few books have topped these.  The other two are somewhat lesser works but still very enjoyable.If  you are interested in Sword and Planet fiction for the kindle ebook. you should also check out the Alan Burt Akers series. which are direct descendents of Burroughs.  Transit to Scorpio is the first in that series.I would also recommend my own Talera series. which includes Swords of Talera. Wings Over Talera. and Witch of Talera. They are also available as ebooks. I see a lot of folks brag on their own books but I am proud of these books. and if you look at the reviews under the paperback versions you'll see that others enjoy them as well and consider them excellent modern continuations of the Sword and Planet tradition."
3,"Burroughs' Barsoom novels were among the first science fantasy books I read as a child long ago. In fact. I still have all eleven volumes in their original Ballantine Books paperbacks stashed in a box. along with numerous works by Heinlein. Clarke. Asimov. and others from the 1960's and 70's that I can't stand the idea of giving up. At least I know I can read them digitally when I want to. Too bad the entire series isn't part of this set.Burroughs' writing style would be considered comically stereotyped and hackneyed by modern standards. but the themes of chivalry. bravery. and respect for others are timeless - even though they might be considered out of style by modern standards. Some ideas are worth preserving. and IMO these types of stories do that very well.I grew up with these types of stories. I want to make sure my grandson can. too."
3,"After seeing the recent major movie. I was prompted to pursue re-reading the original series of novels. I found them to be highly entertaining and as captivating as when I read them long ago. The writing is good. if a bit 'dated'. but Burroughs can still hold your attention. His writting may seem a little juvenile to some but I (at 70+) was thrilled time and again as I read them on my KIndle. I recommend them to all who simply wish to read a series purely for the entertainment value."
3,"The real star in this book is the author.  The writing. although somewhat baroque. is fascinating.  This is the product of a real wordsmith.  Considering when this was written and what the subject matter is. it's hard to put down.  The story. however. is a bit primitive.  I read the story before I found out they were making a movie of it.  Unfortunately the movie was a box office bomb.  If the film is true to the book. I can understand that because I don't think many would have read the book first and the real joy is in the writing. not necessarily the story."
3,"Girl meets boy and they get married. Nevertheless. the author writes quite well which made it more interesting to me; however. the constant interruptions that she included to keep the main couple apart got irritating! Also.if I had realized that she would include explicit gross sex scenes. I probably never would have chosen this book as I don't think her first book was so overly sexual. I prefer Anne Perry.s type of writing about both love and the customs of 18th century England. Or more like Jane Austin."
3,"Since her father's death. Penny's been plagued by troubles on the ranch and sinister characters have been lurking about. and though she doesn't like the idea much. she feels she has no choice but to send for a mail order husband. dreaming of a knight in shining armor coming to right all her problems. despite her professed pessimism regarding the scheme. Penny and Jace were such engaging characters. making great equal partners when it was called for. but also falling easily into the more traditional roles of meek woman and strong. protective man at other times. and it was fascinating to see the movement back and forth between the two. The mistaken assumptions on both sides throughout the story became frustrating and by the end it was heartbreaking to see the characters following through with noble actions that neither of them wanted. I'm glad it all worked out in the end. but I wish things could have been resolved a bit sooner. The humorous bits sprinkled throughout the story were great!"
3,"This is probably the last book I would pick out to read on my own.  I read Alien Agenda. so I was familiar with the works of Steve Peek. I was more than just pleasantly surprised.  Reality is often stranger than anything we could imagine.It starts out like a horror/werewolf story but quickly becomes a credible account of creatures coming through energy portals into this world from a parallel universe.I gave it 5 Stars for being well written. hard to put down. character development. the way the author tied everything together and the fact that every time I thought I had it figured out I was wrong! Doh!Definitely worth reading. And. if you haven't read Alien Agenda. get them both."
3,"Author Steve Peek has created a world that embraces many legends. werewolves. vampires. the like. as beings of an alternate dimension. Gates allow them passage to out world. Ancient humans had learned ways to shut those doors down. building such as Stonehenge. the Indian mounds of the Americas. and other such structures around the world. But as humans spread and built. those impediments were destroyed. weakening those lines connected worldwide.And a pack of Longclaws have found a way to cross over into our world. In their own dimension. they are far down the food chain. In our world. they are incredibly fast with claws protruding from hands made for slashing. cutting up their prey.In northern Alabama forests. cut off by a collapsed bridge and rivers swollen by the torrential rains. there will be a battle between the clan of longclaws and two families. the Masons. from a long line that watched the mounds for just such an event. and an old Indian woman and her granddaughter.Most excellent."
3,"Author Steve Peek will have me sleeping with the lights on for a while. I thought I was over being afraid of the dark. but not after reading this book... Why do I need the lights on?Answer: Longclaws...Steve Peek's writing style is masterful. unique. Just take a peek between the covers... He has written a story that addresses the human condition. our capacity to deal with the unimaginable. and find a way to carry on. I totally enjoyed everything about this book: the plot. the characters. the style. the pace. its unpredictability. and above all. even my coming nightmares when I turn out the lights! I highly recommend this book.Reviewed by Thomas Jerome BakerAuthor ofStory Tellers: In Pursuit of Happiness"
3,"Not a bad book. but too long and drawn-out. The character development of some characters was fabulous while others not so much. It was a very odd mix. I did like the story and the writing. The author has definitely got some talent. but I felt it could use a little red pen love from an editor.The character I most enjoyed was Kelly. but I thought she kind of became minimized towards the end. whereas I really expected to her to have a larger part in the ending.If you like Stephen King and have a Kindle. grab this one. it's not all that expensive and is a good read."
3,"Although I am not a fan of Sci-Fi. I enjoyed this book and will look forward to more from this author. Small town characters. good writing. a little horror. a little medical. it's all there. I'm a little old for things that are too far fetched and unbelievable so I found the tree goddess thing a bit too much for my tastes. He writes like Stephen King in his younger days. and I was reminded of Pet Sematary as I was reading this story.I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. William's work in the future and I. for one. can't wait!"
3,"This was a fast paced tale.  It started off so innocently in the Holy Land with a pleasant trip with just a hint of something wrong.  Greg's  senses were picking up little nuances. but couldn't quite put a finger on what was bothering him.  Just too many coincidences.  After they got home. the fun started.  With Jill kidnapped he had to pull out all the stops and call in every favor he could.  As this is the beginning of the series. it made you think a little harder.  Loved the relationship and the genuine love between them.  A great read.  Recommend reading all this series."
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
3,"This is a very good book. I got it this morning and just finished it. Once I started reading I just could not put it down. Well written with plenty of action. Nice to have an older hero wth vices of trying to quit smoking and holding his temper in control. Neither of which he does very well. There are other reviews that tell you about the main character and plot both of which are very good. I just warn you not to start the book at bedtime as you are sure to lose sleep because you can't put it down."
3,"This not a book; so lets call it a not-book.'  It starts by claiming that it is against the Constitution to hide information about UFOs.The cover is not only at the beginning but in 2 other places.This is the first not-book I have gotten from Amazon.  The 3 covers AND several reader comments (can we spell advertisements) made the experience of this non-book just about worthless.I can understand when an author states that this is the beginning (James Patterson comes to mind)of a book to encourage a reader to buy the rest of the book; unfortunately Mr. Wilkenson did not say that.I would not recommend this non-book to anyone because the lack of material and using reader comments as advertising.  Don't waste your time."
3,"This 'book' contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to. maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh. and of course the obligatory link to the author's other 'books'.Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover. title-page. a couple of blank pages. and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
3,"Even for an essay. this is startlingly devoid of information and features a lot of repetition. It does not offer any reasoning on the topic that cannot be culled from any of the hundreds of full-length books on the topic. and the conclusions have already been reached elsewhere many time. If I wasn't agreeable to the subject matter or those conclusions. this would've easily rated a one-star review; but at least the author had the guts to put it out there - I'll give him that for chutzpah."
3,"Of course. having read 'Surfacing' would have been even better. but this review urges you. compels you to do just that.Its message has been heard before. told by Thoreau. Emerson. Greek philosophers and Indian American shamans: there is more than meet the eye. and only communing with Nature will bring us back to our true nature. Silence speaks volumes to the eager soul ready to change its human life. Strength is found in every day details proving us what we are made of.The quest of 'Surfacing' happens in the wilderness of Canada and its ruthless cold. it could have happened on an island. in the desert. anywhere removed from shopping malls. Starbucks and civilization. The Journey within is worth the read...we then become self-fulfilling. self-made. self-reliant."
3,"A really short &#34;Cliff-Notes-Esque&#34; essay on Margaret Atwood's book. &#34;Surfacing&#34; which dealt with the issues of national and gendered identity. anticipated rising concerns about conservation and preservation and the emergence of Canadian nationalism. The book is complex in the layering of the characters and subject matter with separation being forefront.Margaret Atwood's book has been compared to the likes of Jack Kerouac's On the Road. and to Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar. and rightfully so. A fair comparison of this essay. Stopping the World. to Atwood's book would be like an essay on Herman Melville's Moby Dick with the contents of said essay stating that Moby Dick is about about a man and a fish. While true at a elementary level. would completely miss the point and that is my conclusion with this essay. it seems to completely miss the point of Atwood's message.However I must give merit for an imaginative piece that does try to make apple juice out of oranges."
3,"I've read several books by this author and find myself completely baffled by this poor example of her writing.  The storytelling was so simplistic that it came across as the first work of a freshman English major.  I trained FBI agent would make out with a federal judge whose life is in danger up against his car out in the open?  Story totally lacked realism.  What a waste.  Save your money.  If you like this author avoid this book.  It will sully your better memories of her writing."
3,"I've read other books by this author that are much better than this poorly executed story. It isn't as long as you would think. It started at 2% and ended at 88%. An abrupt ending without really answering some points brought up in the book. A lot of promise with no follow through is what this book amounted to for me. I would not recommend this book to a friend. I say go spend your money on one of the many other wonderful m/m stories available. It moved way too quickly to even make sense. I love you in less than 24 hours. really?"
3,"Some M/M fiction is plot and character driven. with a spicy romance in there somewhere.  This is the writing style that interests me.Other M/M fiction is just a series of sex scenes hung on a flimsy plot.  'Court Appointed' is an example of this type.  I didn't even find the sex scenes compelling. since neither the characters nor their interest in each other were skillfully developed.  I posit too that people in imminent danger of being murdered are not likely to take time out for some nookie while they are still in an extremely vulnerable locale.  Nor are they likely to take even more time to make a phone call from that locale - a call that could easily and safely be completed via cell phone as they sped away to a safehouse.Wish I could figure out which kind of tales these are before buying - its not always obvious."
3,"This may be short but it manages to achieve a lot on all fronts. Hot sex. 2 well developed characters who easily grow on you. tender. touching and emotional moments and a nice plot. I prefer this one to Diving Deep. the longer story from Mitchell. The initial setting is really amusing as both characters meet over a rubbish dump. Cade may be the more experienced. flamboyant and older one but his failed relationship with a 'jerk' has left him vulnerable and lonely. Elliot is a young man. almost a virgin. but romantic at heart believing in finding one true love. They seem very different and you would have thought Cade would have preferred a more exprienced and older lover. But Elliot's persistence and sincerity would win the most hard hearted. Love the chemistry between the 2 men. I would love to read more about this couple making it lasts. A great novella."
3,"I had read all these years ago.  I recently found Wings in the Night Part 1 for a real deal and decided to download to my kindle and revisit one of my favorite series from long ago.  I got caught up again.  I then immediately upon finishing part 1 downloaded Wings in the Night Part 2 and read all of them.  I am now looking on the Wings in the Night Web Site and checking for Rhiannon's Chronicles and info on the new books coming out.  This series does not disappoint.  It matters not if you are revisiting it or if you are a first timer.  It will set the scene for the new books and/or give you a great series for your immediate enjoyment.  I highly recommend."
3,"These stories were just not on a par with the original. TWILIGHT PHANTASIES. and I was so disappointed.  Now this is just my take on this.  Maggie Shayne is a good writer and these could possibly be right down your alley.  I am merely stating that I was so excited to read all of her series but the first book was the best to me.  Her vampires do not possess all the traits of other vampire characters I have read - they don't have as many skills.  Also. they think they are so wonderful they are constantly putting themselves in harms way as though they are not all that bright.  Just off somehow."
3,"I'm used to Julia James doing really involved books. where she leads you to think that the heroine is undesirable but in the end turns out to be the most awesome kind of woman there is. And I don't like her other type of book. I really liked this little book. if it could be called a book. The very first book of hers that I read was The Greek's Million-Dollar Baby. which was of good enough quality for me to proceed to buy at least 5 more of her books within the following days. and this is easily better."
3,"In the final installment to the Affair Series I was riveted by the story of love. betrayal. and forgiveness between the characters. Crandall Thorne was his usual hard mouthed and manipulative self. but you also got to see the vulnerable side of him. The side that longed for the one woman he could never fully have. Dane Roarke was awesome!! I loved him. He knew what he wanted the moment he set eyes on Solange Washington. and he went for it. And even though Solange had doubts about him and him so called womanizing ways. she couldn't help but get sucked into the vortex of passion that was him. Their story was a true love story from start to finish. They showed that if you love someone you can forgive almost anything and make it work. Great story. Fantastic series!!!"
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
3,"I do like m&eacute;nage books...however I much prefer when the female gets ALLLLL of the attention.  Yes. I am selfish that way.  That's my guilty pleasure when I read.  With that being said I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review.  So in fairness I went back and read the ARC again.  I was given a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review.  After my second read I decided on a 5 star review simply because this story has what it needs.  It's short. but you are introduced to the characters without feeling rushed.  You get enough background info on each so that it makes sense without any extra fluff.  There were a couple of odd sentences or typos but nothing that would make you regret the time it takes you to read this novella."
3,"I love On the Edge! Meeting Brett. Leo and Lisa through the out of the box series made me want to know soo much more about these characters. If you haven't read the out of the box set. On the edge is a great introduction to what you will get a whole lot more of in the rest of the series. HOT scenes between the trio. and the different combinations of duos too. I just reread the story again. and the second time around it is still as good as the first... now seriously thinking about reading the rest of them again too :P I love the personalities. and they all play off of each other in great ways. Thanks Kallysten for continuing to keep me aroused. entertained. and eagerly awaiting what ever series instalment you have coming out next. :)"
3,"This is a short story that give you an insight to the series of On The Edge .. Brett owner to a club that not only caters to Vampire but humans as well.. and his girlfriend of 11 months... And how Leo well you gotta read...There is a M/M. M/F. M/F/M scenes not graphic...I found the book to be interesting and different... Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series...I received to book for an honest review and with being a spoiler I found the book to be 4 stars. thanks"
3,"My Thoughts - 5 out of 5 unicorns - I loved it!!!**Gifted to me by the author for an honest reviewOkay first things. this is a very adult erotic short story.  It is only about 25 pages. and it does have some very steamy sex scenes including some M/M/F.The cover is okay and shows the characters. but it doesn&#8217;t grab my attention.  You definitely don&#8217;t want to judge this book by its cover.Okay I loved this story. but if you aren&#8217;t into stories of threesomes or sex scenes then don&#8217;t read this story.  It is a quick read. but it totally had my attention.  You get glimpses into the lives of the 3 characters in this book and some background.  I&#8217;m not usually one for short stories. but Kallysten always does such a fantastic job of sucking me right into her stories.I totally recommend this book to paranormal romance lovers and to anyone who loves Kally&#8217;s work.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more of this series in the future."
3,"Brett. the human and Lisa. the vampire. are quite the couple.  They are the owners of &#34;On The Edge&#34; bar and they're looking for another bartender.  Along comes Leo looking for a job but before he can apply he sees Lisa and she sees him.  Old lovers who forgot why they were no longer together.  Can Lisa talk Brett into letting Leo share their bed?  Read this steamy short and find out if Brett and Lisa gain a bartender and a third in their bed.Kallysten does it again!  Fabulous steamy short stories that leave you wanting so much more."
3,"My. my. my my........Good lord Kallysten you sure know how to bring a reader to the edge.  I immediately formed a perfect picture in my mind of Bret. Lisa and Leo and watching it play out before me in the written word just proved to me that as far as an erotic paranormal writer goes. you are on top.  The story maybe short but the reader will not feel short changed when finished.  I guess if there are really vampires out there. they need somewhere to go where they can let their hair hang down and not hide what they are but revel in it.  Somewhere that humans can mingle. vampires can dine and all enjoy what the other has to offer can be found On the Edge."
3,"Rating 4 1/2 starsI received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated in any way.Brett Andrews has an apartment above his club.  And Lisa is waiting for him.  This is a great way to start off this story.  Leo is an old friend of Lisa&#8217;s that&#8217;s come to the club.  The ending will leave you wanting to read more about this trio and having more of the club experience.Kallysten feeds on her reader&#8217;s need for a sexy vampire &#8211; especially for those of us that are female.  She paints a great picture of what happens when new meets old.  There&#8217;s nothing dark or sinister about what this group has.  If you&#8217;ve never read this author before. why not try this series.  If you love sexy. erotic. vampire short stories you can&#8217;t go wrong by reading Kallysten.  She&#8217;s a great author that knows how to pack a lot in just a few pages.  She never disappoints her readers."
3,"The first book in the On the Edge series is a fast and erotic must read.Catering to humans and vampires at his new club. Brett Andrews thought he had it all including the beautiful vampire. Lisa.  When Lisa&#8217;s old lover shows up at the club. Brett begins to fear that he will lose her. but that&#8217;s not in Lisa or Leo&#8217;s plans at all.This short and fast smooth flowing plot is brought to life with vivid images. intense emotions. and strong compelling characters that grab the reader&#8217;s attention.  The author has created a fascinating world of vampires that captures the imagination and ensures that the reader wants to know more.  The frequent sex scenes are scorching hot with menage and anal sex and well written and sizzling with passion as well as emotion.This is an erotic serial paranormal race that is entertaining and engaging and takes place in the fascinating city of Haventown where humans tolerate vampires.  I can&#8217;t wait to read the next installment."
3,"Short and sweet. Kallysten sure likes to keep us guessing when it comes to her books. Just when she pulls you in and you want more more more. the story ends you are ready to grab the next one.This one is about Brett and Lisa. Lisa is a vampire and Brett is human. They have lived together and been together and run a nightclub together for the past 11 months. Brett love Lisa. that much is evident in this short story. But one night another vampire. one from Lisa's past shows up and has Brett guessing how Lisa really feels about him.Can't wait to grab the next installment of this one to see more of this lovely threesome."
3,"On the Edge will keep you on the edge of your seat as you read this hot story by Kallysten. On the Edge is a short story about a couple. where Brett is the owner of the On the Edge Club and has an apartment above the club with his silent partner Lisa.  Although the club is new in town. it is an instant success as humans and vampires gather to party together.Lisa. a vampire goes down to the club to party and feed. Leo. a vampire from her past appears and she brings him home to play with Brett and her.  Brett is surprised that he likes what the three of them do together. The next morning Leo isn't sure how Brett will feel but the surprise ending made this a perfect short story.  On the  Edge may be short but it is packed with emotion and lots of hot vampire sex.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review.  The views expressed in the review are my own."
3,"This is a short short story that I assume sets the scene for future stories and it does this really well. You get a good picture of the club and what it's like and who it's for. It  introduces the characters. We first meet Brett and Lisa and find out a bit about them and how they feel about one another and then Leo enters the mix. We find out Lisa and Leo have a past. The three spend the night together which manages to not just be hot but tender and loving as well. The story ends with their journey together beginning. It was well done. A good read."
3,"Brett Andrews has been living with and loving Lisa for almost a year.  He adores watching her stalk prey in which to feed when she goes to their club downstairs.  Tonight is no different. except Lisa brings her prey home and Brett finds out he is a vampire as well.Lisa adores Brett. more so than any other man in a very long time.  When she sees Leo at the club. she can't help but bring him upstairs.  Lisa has a plan. She knows Brett's secret desires and has one of her own.On the Edge kept me on the edge that is for sure. Delightfully erotic. I found Brett's attraction to Leo just downright arousing.  Lisa knew what she wanted and was not afraid to reach for her dreams.  M&eacute;nages are one of my favorite types of books to read and On the Edge was just the perfect read for me. Full of sensuality. it left me satisfied.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"Kallysten kept me involved throughout the book and I will definitely be looking for other books involving Bret and Lisa's Club &#34;On The Edge&#34; I enjoyed this initial meeting with the characters and hope to learn more about hem and the club.Bret and Lisa have been busy. opening a club. balancing their relationship and the fact that oh yeah she's a vampire who refuses to feed from him has helped keep things interesting. Leo might be exactly what they didn't know they needed but can Bret get past his jealousy issues to accept what Leo could possibly offer?Bret and Leo are both strong male characters and I loved the fact that Lisa can handle herself around them.  Of course being a Vampire helps. Leo is also a vampire and Lisa's former lover when he randomly shows up in Bret's club things get complicated the question is can Lisa handle this situation.I loved this story. although an incredibly short read it shows the depth I've come to expect from Kallysten! More proof of why I love her!"
3,"I read this and felt the tears coming. How moving. I'm not certain if it was just me being overly emotional. but this book lead me to tear up and weep along with the stories.I've always imagined that I would be reached by loved ones and that they would send me the message that is necessary for my moment - a moment of encouragement. What a true blessing (and I don't use that b word much) for those to have received such a gift. Reading about it gives clarity. insight. and hope. so I can imagine that those who are actually touched by these events must be clearer about life and living."

I think myMother chose John 1. Because he has dark hair she always loved dark haired men. 2. For his kind trusting eyes they say the eyes are the Windows to the soul and his soul is the kindest.

You will be drooling over those features for the rest of your day!Enjoying The Show.....what more can i say.....where can i find a man like Mr Tool. Yes. you read that correctly. Mr Tool is the name the ladies of Abberwick Apartments have named there fantasy man and next door neighbor.Even though this book is only a short novel. it is soooooo worth reading. The story is entertaining. the characters are adorable. the humor is really funny and well you just need to buy it to see why it is sooooooo hot ummm.....good!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
3,"What a way to start the weekend!  Sexy Gage struts his 'stuff' for the girls to see.  Little did we know he was hoping Hailey would catch the show and fall for him.  He is a brave man to show it off just to get his girl.Hailey is so sweet.  I was glad to see a curvy woman be the center of attention. Lots of yummy sexy encounters while they work out their issues.Hailey and Gage figure it out with the help of family and friends. just the way it should be.Can't wait until the next brothers installment."
3,"Gage Warren harbors a serious crush for the sexy woman watching him. Hailey Jennison is the only reason he parades around his apartment once-a-week giving the women across the quad a show. He's asked around about her and knows she's infamous at turning down dates. Gage's desperation leads him to blackmail her into a date. He's sweet. but he's no charmer. Instead. his directness is a huge turn-on!Hailey has tried for years to get people to look past her playmate body to the capable woman -- with brains! -- within.  She's alienated herself with her standoffish attitude.  But once Gage comes into the picture. she completely blooms.It's a quick read. but so worth it!"
3,"Amy works way too hard as a lawyer and basically has no personal life.  The good side to her working so hard is always getting to see Justin. a man she's wanted for years.  Amy and Justin end up having to go to Hawaii to finalize a case they've been working on.  Little does Amy know that Justin has wanted her since the day he saw her.  While in Hawaii he intends to make his feelings known and give her one of her secret fantasies.The book wasn't very long. but it was very sweet.  There was a good relationship between Amy and Justin and very little drama.  Both characters were nice. had great chemistry. and seemed believable.  There wasn't a ton of information in the book either. but since the characters had known each other for years the way things happened in the book didn't seem unrealistic.  If you want a sweet. sexy story this is a good one that won't leave you feeling depressed."
3,"I loved curling up with this over the Holidays. Belle and Rafe are so cute together. They are a believable couple with all the family 'drama' wrapped up in the story. It had great character development. I think many women her age will see themselves in Belle. We all worked too much out of college and found it difficult to put family 'first' when we were starting out in our careers. Where was Rafe when I needed him?!?!? I also enjoyed an insight into the Portugese culture. especially around the holidays. I wish more authors would incorporate different cultures into their books. Love comes in many colors and cultures.Get some tea. your favorite quilt. and curl up with this book. you won't be disappointed!"
3,"What I Loved: Scott was such a delicious guy to read!  He was just the right amount of alpha vs vulnerable.  He was also YUMMY!  The fact that he was blind kind of made him that much more lovable.  Tara and Scott had a great chemistry that was fun to read.Complaint: The ending was way to abrupt!  It felt like a whole chapter was left out of the bookWhat makes this good Holiday read:  If you are looking for a short but naughty holiday read this may work for you.  It was about getting out of a bad situation into a good situation.  Just keep in mind the rather abrupt ending."
3,"What a disappointment. I thought it would be a nice Christmas romance. but it turned out to be disjointed. with underdeveloped characters. and an unrealistic storyline. The chemistry between the two characters wasn't even believable. but even that was ruined by the crude description of what develops between the two of them. It was like two teenagers in heat. I found myself wondering what happens in the end. there was no closure to the psycho ex- boyfriend. The content was lousy. Thank goodness this book was free. It was an hour read at best. with no real beginning. middle. or end. Major diservice to the visibly challeneged in that he's seen as weak and needy."
3,"I'll be honest..this isn't a 5 star book.  But it didn't deserve all the one star ratings out there and it doesn't deserve the average three star rating it has as of this posting.  I gave it a 5 to help even out the score.  There are some awful 1-3 star kindle books out there. and this just isn't one of them.  The book is kind of silly and FULL of ranchy sexy goodness.  The characters aren't annoying and the book is written well (not by a dyslexic monkey who may or may not be a fan-fic tween - like some books).Give it a shot.  I liked it enough to look up the other books in the series.  Maybe you will like it too."
3,"I'm totally in love with Lila Dubois and her Monsters in Hollywood series.  I grabbed this as a free read and am so glad I did! The second I finished this book I downloaded book 2. My Fair Monster!Clever premise. excellent writing. lovable characters and blistering hot sex!  I had to crank up the A/C!The main romantic characters. Michael the monster and Lena the hollywood power player. come through an amazing journey in a short time but it just works.  It's not rushed as some books would have main characters go from strangers to engaged in sixty seconds.  You feel his worry over her acceptance of his monster form. her struggle to love all parts of him. and the obstacles in their way.  The timing of their acceptance of each other and their emotions is perfect.  The dialogue was great. the stories behind their names - hilarious!  The monsters sneaking into homes to watch movies of humans is wonderful.Don't miss this book or this series!"
3,"Prequel to the series. this is more short story than anything else. Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely. This is something of the set up for the rest of the books. In fact. you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter's trademark. Don't look for depth- just desperation and passion. It is more of an experience than a story. It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series. you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books. This is one of my favorite series- hot. sensual. dark & dangerous. This story is more of an aside. like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe."
3,"I got one book. for free from my libary (# 3) so at that time I did not even realize these were a series.  But I really enjoyed that one so I went back to start at the beginning with this book.  I don't think you have to read them in order. there is enough information that I did not feel lost reading them out of order.  I really liked the story of this first book. the characters were very endearing in my opinion. I hope this helps someone else enjoy a good series."
3,"So I actually started The Darkest Night first then realized this one was first so had to pause DN to read this one :PI liked this short. first look into the series. Kadence and Geryon were a heartbreaking but sweet tale. Although this story was very short and at times it seemed a little rushed. I loved the emotion behind this couples need for each other.The fact that they could forge that connection while in hell made it that much more potent.I never thought I'd like a half-beast man...oh. who am I kidding? I want aliens. vampires. Lykae. Gods and Demons at this point. Half-beasts actually seem tamed compared to that :pNow that I have the back story. I'm dying to go and finish Maddox. He was KILLING me. Ungh Violence. I'm coming back for ya baby!"
3,"There was NO basis for their love. He humiliated her in front of people who could have helped her cause and asked her for a night with him!!! She had been working for months to get where she was and he just wiped it all away. I know he fixed it but it was his mistake to fix. he was not being sweet about it because he caused the issue for NO reason!!! She forgave him the very next day and that night. they are MADLY in love and a marriage proposal is a day away!!! Ridiculous and unbelievable!!!"
3,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful. but she is strong. compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate. but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in. but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love. hate. romance and philanthropy."
3,"The inspiration for this book was sweet. however. by the second half of the book. it was unclear if the story was about the experience of Jack's near boat catastrophe or about the lost opportunity for love.  The tone of the writing sharply changed also. to the point that it would be believable that someone else wrote the last half.  The ending was sweet. yet predictable.  The story could have used some more background on the marital relationship of the main character and the children's relationship with their father.  They seemed too accepting of Jack.  Would have expected some resentment from the eldest daughter who had been named after her mom's true love."
3,"At times this was a really good story. at others it wasn't. But it sure was a worthwhile book. nevertheless.Sandra Mercer was surprised to find her daughter Carla wearing a letter sweater that Sandra knew belonged to the boy she'd once planned to marry. 30 years ago.  Carla's new boyfriend. Kevin. was the nephew of that man. Jack Dawson - and Jack had just moved back to town!  As the story continued. the things that had happened over those thirty years to both people. the reasons why things had happened as they did. all were made known.  Also. that Jack and Sandra still loved one another - but after all that time. it may not be possible to be together.  Especially because of a sailboat race. something Jack wanted to take part in. that turns so deadly that Jack and the crew may never return."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
3,"There is a love potion floating around the Ton and the males are droping out of their celibate states in record numbers. much to the dismay of the remaining few.Not quite believing the tale but secretly worried. Lord Vailmont sets out to discover the truth.The potion maker. Sylvia. has secrets to protect and a stepdaughter's season to finance. She has no time for Vailmont and everything to loose if he comes too close. Unfortunately. he is very attractive. Could her family spell book help her find a way to control her feelings ?This a a book about relunctant lovers. She does not want to love and he. definitively does not want to marry. The potion that even its maker think a fake. might have some magic in it after all. They are caught in their own games and secrets and love finds it way.This is light. funny. frothy reading."
3,"I've never been one to read any kind of romance novels. but since I got my kindle I've been perusing through different types of genres.  I have read several of her novellas. she is good for keeping you entertained.  Fast paced and spicy. they are not for someone who blushes easily.  I really like this one. I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters.  Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen. cuz some like it hot.  Haha."
3,"Erickson's characters are well-drawn for what they are and their feelings and actions drive the plot.  Switching perspective between the two main characters keeps the story moving forward at a comfortable pace and the sex scenes are wonderfully steamy.  In fact. I was listening to this novel on Kindle text-to-voice while driving and almost had to turn it off for being too distracting.My only note -- and this is minor -- is that the charity set up didn't make complete sense to me.  You can't set up a charity home to keep kids out of foster care -- it would just be foster care in a group setting.  It didn't really detract from the book -- it was just obvious that Erickson was looking for something to lend depth to the characters.I would certainly read Erickson's other novels."
3,"This short novella was in deed. a very H-O-T read! The characters were well developed for a short novella & the storyline & plot was quite interesting. Brittany and her two best friends had just won the lottery and Charlie is their financial advisor/planner. Brittany & Charlie have a passionate & hot interlude that leads to hot. scorching sex & plenty of them too ;) Brittany is an emotionally wounded heroine as evident by her past & Charlie is sexy Mr. Nice Guy where he helps break down Brittany's barriers. They are opposites. yet they are perfect for one another. This was definitely a super sexy read. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a hot erotica. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
3,"I have read a few of Karen Erickson's books previously and overall she's a pretty good writer. I enjoyed this book. but it wasn't something I was thinking about much after finishing it. Not a huge amount of depth to the heroine. I had some trouble relating to her with her need for useless spending. but she did have great chemistry with the hero and I liked that there wasn't a huge 'end of the relationship' moment like many romances. rather the characters progressed in their relationship without tons of drama. Overall a good read and I would read this author again. the rest of the series would be worth checking out also."
3,"I don't have a problem with sex scenes. even explicit ones.  I like them when there is also a story where to place them.  In this book there is sex and more sex and the story is not present at all. at least in the first half that was all I could read.  I was hoping for more substance and that is what kept me reading.  But there was only sex for sex sakes.  If you like erotica with a bit of a story then this is for you but if what you like is romance with sex in it then I don't think that you would like this book."
3,"The story premise was cute. Hunky editor 'tricks' his prized writer into learning more about his desires. She thinks he's too hot to be interested. He's decided to go for broke to show her what she means to him. And. he's trying to bring her out of her funk after her cat died and show her that she CAN let someone get close enough for her to love. A handy snowstorm comes along to trap them together. It was very erotic. as the title suggests. Good. hot. short read. I will have to find more from Mari Carr."
3,"The story idea was sweet. with a hunky editor who is trying to convince his prized writer to start writing erotic novels.  Given that this is a new genre for her. they engage in a little erotic research under the premise of helping her writing.  I liked the characters and the scenarios. but I expected a bit more eroticism and a little less sweet.  It seemed as though the sex scenes were a bit on the vanilla side compared to other books in this genre.  Still. a light and entertaining read."
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
3,"Wow! out of the chute action. romance and one Hot Outlaw named Cal Ryker!***************This is a follow up from RIDING WEST (believe me when I say it means Celia was 'hehehe...riding Parker West!'..not the compas direction..) I suggest ya'all read that one first!Cal is one dreamy Cowboy. with a quick draw and a reputation that sets the other 6 members of the train robbing gang to thinking twice before denying his offer to trade his share of the take for the woman they took hostage. Cal's original plan to just keep Laurel safe until he can return her to her family. goes awry when they find themselves alone for 2 weeks!.......(2 steamy weeks)What starts out as a hasty rescue winds up as more of a heartfelt romantic tale complete with smart. sassy and sexy dialogue as only Emma can conjur. This is one short tale that packs alot of romantic pillow talk and honest character development that will make you 'sigh' and beg Emma for more. more. more of those West/Evans's stories."
3,"I very much enjoyed. It was sensual. and romantic.. Cal and Laurel were wonderfly done. I cheered for her through the entire story. A bit of mystery and a lost sole finding home. I could almost hear the wind in the trees. Miss Wildes painted such vivid pictures with her words.Will add Miss Wildes to my authors to watch.Storyline: outlaw romanceIntimacy: sensual. but not eroticEnjoyment: read with out stopping. did not want to stop for dinner.Book length: 41.000 wordsKindle length: na read in ePub format"
3,"Can't get much better than this!! Cal is the ultimate Alpha. and Laurel is a very likable 'Damsel in Distress'. One of my favorite Romance themes is where the Hero denies his feelings from the get go and I love to see them fall under the lady's spell. Emma Wildes does it great!! I loved the first book in this series 'Riding West' and I really hope to see more as soon as possible. Wildes has a way of taking you back to this time period effortlessly and the LOL moments are something I greatly appreciate(not to mention. the STEAM FACTOR).Pick this fun. sexy and suspenseful read up!! you won't be disappointed!"
3,"Others are more comprehensively detailed--A Night To Remember comes to mind--but this book. first printed in 1912. is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN.  It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers. the ship. the wreck.  It's one of the more human of accounts. and. paradoxically. one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time.  A must-have curiousity for Titanic students."
3,"The book. originally written just after the sinking of the Titanic. reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was published. especially with regard to the distinct roles of men and women. Obviously bereft of the insights derived from the discovery of the Titanic. it nevertheless raises two provocative issues: a fire in the coal bunker and unruly passengers being shot. However. I wish to clarify the matter of pictures which the mixing of reviews for two different editions has created.  The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted. but it DOES have photographs. The decision. therefore. is whether the inclusion of the photos is worth spending a dollar rather than getting the text for free. I think the photos. while not spectacular. greatly enhance the presentation and would therefore recommend the MacMay edition."
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
3,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However. there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK. the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in 'Man of Steel.'"
3,"I thought this would be a great book after reading the description.  But. the author has put way too much filler in and that just turned me off. There are also lots of misinformation as to how things work out. For example:  He ambled!  Her senses hummed.  Women don't growl in dismay. they likely would sign or moan. Men don't glide. cattle bawl. they don't bray.  Mules and donkey bray!  And on and on.  I think the author had a good idea for a story. but she just had a first novel or juvenile attempt at this one. I got it free and I am happy at that.  Cannot recommend it.  Explicit sex is also a turn off."
3,"During the wholes series I was and I am a fan of DJ. I love the way she treats her friends and helps them. Even love her bad habbits :-).What I did not like was the way this story was going. Quinn isn't able to stand a woman. who is standing on her own feet and not fearing to fight for herself? Does he really need to make her small to fell great. feel like a man?For me this book is pushed high. You must know Susan Mallory offers her readers in the US free books 14 days before publishing and they have to write a review to be in the next round for a free book."
3,"Up until the point where the author wrote that the Pope Pius XII and the Catholic Church did nothing to help the Jews. the story was engrossing. However. the author didn't do his research well or he would have learned the truth. The black legend that said that the Pope did nothing to help the Jews may be the 20th century's most enduring lie. Historical documents prove that he did whatever he could to save them. His dilemma was how does he speak out without further endangering the Jews. He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries. Hundreds of priests went to the death camps for speaking out against Hitler.I. a Jewish woman. gave this book one star because of this major flaw."
3,"This was a great read.... spellbinding accounts of the Jewish resistance to the murderous tyranny of Nazi Germany during Hitler's reign of terror..... I'd love to say it was encouraging but instead the accounts are real-'ish' ( I did think it was a true story at first..... turns out it is supposedly based on accounts... I will be wanting to research some now!) and stories that need to be told often enough that we never forget what happened to over 6 million people while the world did nothing.My only downside was the 'intimate scene' relayed on two occasions..... I would have liked for a younger audience to be able to read it and not have to get through those..... these are definitely stories that need to be told to a new generation.... other Holocaust writers have done this well..."
3,"Why ruin a good book with sex scenes?This was a hard book to read. but that was to be expected- it's very depressing subject matter.  It was well handled. though. fairly well written for the most part. I would give it a 3 or 4 star rating. if it wasn't for the 2 sex bits. They didn't fit the rest of the story. and pulled me out of it completely. Unnecessary. ill-suited to the story. If not for that. this would have been a good story from a unique viewpoint."
3,"At first. I didn't know what to expect from this book.  I thought it would be your typical survivor story but I was so wrong.  This is a book that had me sad one minute and cheering the next.  I'm not going to lie. at times it was hard to read--this is a very heavy subject. There were some very intense scenes that shocked me. especially because they really happened.  It's so hard to imagine living a life like this.  I wish it is was a work fiction and that this wasn't a real part of our history."
3,"Okay so this book literally goes one paragraph in the present. then a flashback. present for a bit. flashback. It was so annoying. I felt so disconnected to the characters. I ended up rushing through because it was so annoying. I would not recommend this book. The hero constantly says he just feels lust for his WIFE. He talks about how he cannot let himself feels anything else. It is your WIFE. you are MARRIED. you can feel love for your wife you stupid anti-hero!!!! It was so aggravating. Then she walks out and he does not come after her but one word and a crook of the finger and there she goes running to him. It was just a pathetic excuse for a book and really. writing in general."
3,"Love. love. love this book. The author did a wonderful job writing this story. I think the three of them are perfect together. There will be funny moments that  will make you laugh. I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already. I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author. Her latest update to this story 'ever after' was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book. Can't wait to see Paige McKellan next book."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
3,"When she was young. Rachel's aunt entertained her with fanciful tales of people who could change their form at will. Now. years later. she discovers those tales are shockingly real. And if she isn't surprised enough about that. her aunt's final will instructs her to find her OWN inner beast. discover the lost totem that will protect the town and all its inhabitants. and to mate with her dazzlingly sexy protector. Burke.For a novella. the story and characters are remarkably well-developed. It's just the right length for someone who doesn't have much time on their hands to read before going to sleep at night to induce some very vivid dreams. There are some questions left unanswered in Rachel's Totem. but. fortunately. the other novels in the Cougar Falls series will clear them right up."
3,"***spoilers alerts***The writing was easy enough to get through and was not dragged on and on by overly descriptive scenery. The town. its people were interesting. but as a reader you hardly had time to get to know anyone. Though I wanted to fall in love with the hot Burke. I felt like he wasn't macho enough to mark HIS mate on his own. That's the only conclusion I could think of that required his brothers' involvement in marking Rachel by them all. And after having told her sex wasn't required to mark her.Though the love scenes were hot. I found the fact that he shared her with his brothers distasteful. Not my thing. The only reason I'd consider reading another book of the series is because I'm curious about the other types of shifters."
3,"Frankly I read 2nd book in the series (In plain sight) first and loved it.  Then I  picked up Rachel's totem and it was such a dissapointment. Some parts were completly absurd and . really. immature and crude. I also did not like 4some. We are talking about mates who mate for life. And then f/m/m/m sex scene comes in.and for those who say it was really necesery in this storyline. then 1st. I dont think it was (think of Maggie) and 2nd. this storyline was author's imagination. It just did not fit into 'mating for life' scenario.After 1st book (In plain sight) I added the 3rd book of the series into my must-buy-when-it-comes-out-list but now Im thinking of crossing it off."
3,"Rachel has come back to Cougar Falls in search of a new beginning. The legacy from her beloved Aunt Charlotte couldn't have come at a more fitting time.Burke Chastell just wants Rachel to collect her inheritance and sell him the land so they can find the totem that protects Cougar Falls before the rest of the world discovers not only that it exists. but all of its secrets.Rachel's Totem by Marie Harte is HOT!  I enjoyed this story more than expected. Since it is part of an ongoing series. I was afraid I would be lost and confused. but I wasn't. I had no problem following the story and motivations of the characters. There was an unexpected m&eacute;nage. but it was definitely a fun one. I will be checking out more of Ms. Harte's stories after this one.Elysiareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"I would say this book is a decent read.  Not stellar. but not trashy or annoying.  It is probably the best book in the series that I've read so far.  I'd say that while these have thusfar been entertaining (taking up time and diverting my mind). there really just doesn't seem to be too much going on.  At least this one had a bit of action.  Story was weak. and characters were somewhat predictable.  But not a bad read for &lt;$3."
3,"This is a well written short novella. It is very interesting how the whole city and its very particular characteristics are depicted with precise yet spare language.A lady arrives to Cougar Falls. a place that is not in the maps to inherit her aunt property. It turns out she also inherits the responsibility about the fate of the city. There is romance. some fights. a bit of suspense.There are some steamy scenes. f/m and and a lady with three brothers.The whole story is interesting. and the door to a series; it does work standalone. Good for a fast read."
3,"A town that does not appear in the maps. a missing totem that is needed to save it from outsiders and a love story between a sexy shapeshifter and a woman with special skills make it an entertaining read despite the characters being a bit flat for my taste.There are a couple of very sexy scenes including a hot threesome; I just wish the author  developed the relationship with Burke's brothers a bit more. because it ended when it was getting really good. but overall I think there is potential for the next books in this series."
3,"I enjoyed it. It was a superficial read which means there wasn't a ton of explanation of different things - like the town. why the alpha could stay an alpha even when he was not there. how easy it is to turn into a puma (why aren't there more of them then?). the heroine being fine with becoming a werepuma. the rushed mating process. etc.What sets this book apart is its humor. I found myself chuckling very frequently at some really LOL moments. I must have a strange sense of humor because most books others consider funny don't even get me to crack a smile. Whatever. This series does.As for the plot and the characters - they are o.k.Bottom line: Sex was hot. dialogue was funny. characters were likable enough. I bought the rest of the series. At a less than three buck price tag they are more than worth it."
3,"Oh my god what can I possibly say about the beginning of this series?Absolutely ridiculous beyond belief. Did it have its redeeming points? Yes it had humor and was rather funny in some parts of the book but over all I am absolutely boggled by the way the characters just accept things. I mean seriously I understand this is a paranormal romance and has explicit naughty dirty sexy yumminess involved but I am expecting something to include with that. This one the characters just fall short of the mark. and are absolutely unrealistic in the way they take their situation with the amount of stride they take it into it. The plus size factor was enjoyable in the book but I find that it falls short of the mark again in how she only seemed to own it in her comfort with the validation from having a hot man on her shoulder.Yeah it was just another idea of the rest of the series. For the price it is entertaining but not worth more at all."
3,"This book was a waste of time and money. This book even at $3.85 was too short. It was listed at 114 pages but only 82 were actual story the last 40 pages were ads. The writing was pretty amaturish. The plot had promise but everything happened in a rush. The story took place in 2 days and when the 2 girls found out these men were werecats they were like really? that's cool. Very little reaction was shown to something that was really a pretty big life altering discovery. They didn't seem to care that these guys turned them into werecats. The explanation of the shifter world was glossed over not delved into. The heroine discovered her powers in a shazam moment. All of the learning about being a shifter happened off camera. Stated not shown. I was disappointed all around and the instances of cute dialog did not overcome the defects of little character or world development and absurdly easy acceptance of magical creatures."
3,"Likeable characters and engaging story but the way the main characters suddenly became mates was a little too fast for me.  I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com."
3,"This story is the beginning to a series and I really enjoyed it. The price point is about right for these short little stories so don't expect too much as this is very short. Dana Marie Bell has a new fan in me as the story moves right along. isn't too out there and I loved the domineering little Emma and how Max responds to her before even seeing her again. I thought the 'marking' her was a little abrupt. but I can look past that by saying that A) this is about shapeshifters and B)An Alpha gets what he wants when he wants it.Buy. Read. Enjoy."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
3,"Overall. I was absorbed in this story and the semi-abrupt ending has really left me for wanting more.  Don't get me wrong on the ending though.  It was abrupt only in the fact that I wanted to know more and there wasn't any.  I've already checked out Kaye's site and the only other novel listed is Angelic Avenger. which I don't believe is in this series.  I'm 99.9% sure of that one.  So. I'm going to be hoping there's more to this story in the future because I really want to know.  Definitely a great read for anyone looking for something new.For my full review. check out Literary Escapism."

Tiger by the Tail is a great summer read.Vivianreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"I bought this book without reading the reviews. Getting on here now. it seems that they all pretty much agreed with me. This was a fantastic story and sucked me right in. Then it just ended. It felt like I read the first third of the book and then found the rest of the pages ripped out.When you are raised as an outcast. what happens when you suddenly find yourself a queen of the people who banished your parents? Then how do you act when you find out that the last few rulers have all been murdered? Well. we don't really know because the story just ended before finishing the plot line!As much as I enjoyed the story. I would recommend waiting to see if there is a second one before reading it. If this story is going to be finished in a second book. I would definitely recommend it though.This was easy to read and the characters grab you. The only downfall was that it leaves you swinging in the breeze at the end."

Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
3,"Kasey and Garrett are twins who happen to be both gay and public figures. Garrett is an out gay actor and Kasey a basketball player who isn't ashamed of his sexuality but is hesitant about comming of for safety reasons.Gram is an openly gay club owner in the city the twins live in. Garrett frequents the club more often than Kasey does but Gram has a crush on Kasey.This is Kasey and Gram's story and it is a good one about find love and working to hold on to it even when it doesn't fit your 'ten year plan' to have it now.Kasey and Gram find ways to be together without to many problems and Gram is an amazing partner who respects Kasey's need to not be out to the world.A very good short story that delivers on many levels with some pretty hot sex scens"
3,"This book starts off a bit hesitantly--it's the first of a couple dealing with Kasey Johnson and his twin brother Garrett. but it heats up incredibly fast and in such a way as your initial reaction might be. &#34;um. whaaaaaaat?&#34;  Kasey is a second-year professional basketball player obviously playing for the Phoenix Suns--he's a 6'5&#34; blond god who is gay and has not come out. though his equally impressive brother. Garrett. a rising movie star. is openly gay.  There are so many &#34;this is absurd&#34; twists that this book takes which are dealt with brilliantly by author Chase that you actually believe that this stuff can happen. especially today.  You will not forget these characters. including Kasey's devoted seducer and eventually lover. Gram. and you will run right out and get its sequel. High Line. featuring Garrett. as soon as you finish this full court press."
3,"The beginning was very good. I liked the fact that Gram didn't know if Kasey was gay and he had all the worries of a teenager who doesn't know if he has a chance with his love interest or not. Their first kiss on the couch of a nightclub. stealing a moment in a dark. was beautiful and hot and sweet at the same time. It was a promise that wasn't really fulfilled.After that there's a lot of sex and the plot (young sport star who has to decide whether to stay in the closet and keep his endorsements or to come out and face the consequences with his teammates and fans) is lost in the bedroom. We don't really know the two characters and especially Gram is rather flat.There are no real problems in the book and it is a fast and hot read. but it seems incomplete and rushed at the end. like a collection of little episodes. but nothing really tying them together."
3,"Kasey Johnson is a professional basketball player.  His twin brother Garrett is a famous actor. They're both gay but Kasey isn't out.  Ingram Fletcher is the owner of Liverpool. a night club that Kasey and Garrett frequent. Gram has been secretly attracted to Kasey for a long time. Kasey likes Gram as well. but he can't come out to the public. Can one night of passion ever be anything more?Out of Bounds is a sweet romance with a lot of hot sex. Kasey is charming and Gram is sexy. They face prejudice and have to hide their relationship but they're stronger for it.  Out of Bounds is a good story.Nannettereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"Trite and repetitive - why do gay novels generally tend to be little more than a series of strung togther sex scenes with little narrative content ad even less literary value.  Come on guys we deserve better than this.  The theme of issues of being openly gay in sport is raised but the the novel closes before the consequences of being out are seen and the story developed.  Mills and Boon for gay men with sex included!  An hour's read at best with little characterisation or story outside the sex scenes."
3,"This latest from TA Chase is very sexy and hot. Vol 1 centers on Kasey a famed but closeted basketball star. who finds love with a much older nightclub owner.The story could have been more angsy if the writer so choose asit is never easy for a gay athlete to come out as he could lose all his fans and sponsors. But TA focuses more on the erotica side. the tauntings from fellow players. reporters more a side issue. And it works as this man writes the sex scenes so well. And it is rare to have a well over 6 feet basket ball player being 100% bottom even if an agressive bottom in a relationship. Interesting main and side characters and I look forward to more in this series."
3,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic. with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes. but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving. dangerous. and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story 'The Love of Sports Series. Book 2'."
3,"I wouldn't say that Crystal Jordan's 'Treasured' is a spanking novel.  I would say that this book is an erotic novel containing a lot of sex with a spanking or two thrown in for good measure.  That said I still really enjoyed this book.  The focus may not have been on spanking. but it was still a hot read.Becca was the perfect protagonist.  She was strong. independent. and could sword fight better than a man.  But when she and James were together. she was completely submissive.  Her loyalty to James was both sexy and endearing.If you are looking for a steamy novel to read. this one is perfect for you.  It is well written and keeps the reader engaged.  I only wish it had a few more spankings amidst all the spicy sex.Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview"
3,"I picked this book up to read in the evening. intention was to just 'start' it. But darn it. the beautifully written time travel pirate adventure had me glued to the spot -- a real Midnight Oil Burner! And can you say hot? HOT! This baby is smoking hot...pearls. that is different way to wear pearls. Just saying!  Yeah. if you like your sexy romps. and enjoy reading smut with time travel. then you're probably going to enjoy this as much as I did. And isn't that cover delicious? Oh. my."
3,"The negative reviews were leaning me towards not reading this book. After reading it it's not that bad it's just another case of different strokes for different folks. Rebecca travels through time to 1715 to James who is a pirate. while the other Rebecca originally from 1715 travel to the present. There was a little action as well as good loving between Rebecca and James. the original Rebecca from 1715 was a meanie to everyone around her so when the Rebecca who came from the present was around everyone they saw this change of a nice Rebecca so that lead James to wonder about the new Rebecca. Hope I'm not confusing. But it wasn't that bad. Now even though I liked the story it was ok it's not a Wow story but an ok."
3,"This book started off interestingly enough. which is why I gave it 2 1/2 stars. but it quickly turned into just your below average romance novel.  It never explained the correlation between Joe and the test dummy. or why these bizarre events took place.The book was too short and didn't give enough detail about the characters and the ending was way too pat. like she just wrapped it up quickly because she was out of things to say.I think this writer has some talent. which is another reason for 2 1/2 stars. but the story needs to be fleshed out further next time.This book was nicely formatted for the Kindle."
3,"This book was WAY too short for the storyline (yeah. usually I complain about the opposite too). The plot was intriguing. interesting and very different - and let's face it. a lot of books out there are just a constant rehash. There were so many different ways the author could have taken it. but it ended so quickly. I wonder why she chose to not delve deeper into the characters and flesh out the plot? This book could have been absolutely fabulous. instead it feels like an unfinished book. I give it 4 stars for the great book idea alone. I hope the author decides to do something else with this idea or maybe build off of what she has here."
3,"It is now $2.00 at Amazon.And it is only 2137 locations.'Lost in a reality only he and Anna inhabit. Joe finds himself falling in love with his intended victim. and ultimately fighting to save her life-because whoever hired him still wants her dead.'and'Warning: This title contains explicit sex. occasional bad language and extreme violence perpetrated against crash test dummies.'I liked the SciFi premise. The story was actually shorter than 2137 locations.  There was a lot of explicit sex for the length of the work.But a fun read.  Don't bother though if you have a problem with the explicit sex."
3,"I got this book for my Kindle free; after reading I'm really glad I didn't pay anything for it. The storyline had the potential for a good 'Twilight Zone' kind of story. but was just too lightweight to make it. The author seems to feel the need to put in really XX rated sex scenes - she seemed to love to be able to use the word c**k. I didn't find this adding anything to the story. and only finished it because it's a fairly short book."
3,"I love this book.The writing is fresh. the humor sneaky and the plot is nothing like a standard old paranormal. My only complaint is I wish it was longer. but Treanor does manage to make me care about Anna and Joe. I don't have a problem with an assassin hero in this. and even better Joe never turns into a typical domesticated reformed man--he keeps his edge of danger.I thought I'd be squicked because. hey. she lusts after a crash test dummy .... but the heat works really well.After I read it. Marie Treanor went on my autobuy list and she hasn't disappointed me yet."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
3,"My title says it all.  I was glad I was able to download it for free. I would have liked to see the h not cave in so quickly. she just melted at the drop of a hat when the H's were around.  She had legitimate gripes and didn't hold fast to her convictions.  I do like Maya Banks as an author and will not stop this book from reading others this however was somewhat a disapointment. A side note: I felt bringing a future child into this story kept me from enjoying it more.  I tend to get lost in the fiction and once a pregnancy was mentioned I tended to start to troubleshoot the arrival of an infant into this non-traditional household.  That's just me though.  Enjoy"
3,"this book is very touching as in you knew that deep down that the charcters loved each other. no matter what because overall love conquers all in the end. I wished the males could have been detailed more of their back ground but all in all good book. idk it felt like it was missing something from somewhere but maybe thats just me. it started from a different place especially of this kind genre. which i liked alot. like some of the others wrote you don't really read about the ups and downs during arelationship over the years. all in all good book"
3,"My husband is a workaholic with his own business like Logan and Rhys so I so understood the hurt the leading lady felt in feeling like your husband is married to the job instead of you.  I love how Maya shows the struggles and the rewards that are the roller coaster of life and that sometimes a woman has to stop being a doormat and make hard choices in order to be truely happy.  Let me also just add that this book has some of the hotest and raw menage love scenes that I have read before or since.  I read this book months ago and the images haven't faded in the least which is why Maya Banks is one of my top 5 favorite authors!!"
3,"SPOILERS!Mostly sex scenes with a few scenes mixed in. When she was in the hospital. why she didnt have them call her husbands secretary? She seems to always be able to contact them. yet we are supposed to believe that the heroine would only try their cellphones?And why suddenly did she act like it was ALL her fault?Also. why did they act like this deal could make or ruin their career. and yet they risk their marriage by leaving her. acting like they need this for their business to survive. They didnt even get the deal! They just gave it up after two days trying. why didnt they do that before???After losing this deal their business wasnt even affected as they hired new people. and expanded their business. I know im supposed to suspend belief. but it frustrates me that they made such a big deal about nothing."
3,"I loved this short story. Morgan has wanted her boss for a year but since she's the original tomboy/girl next door. she hasn't been able to get up the courage to let him know she's interested. Finally she decides to dress the part and it really works.The plot was good. the action is fast and furious and there really is a story. The entire story happens within a few hours but it's well paced and well written and above all the price is right!  I like Ms. Jacobs!"
3,"Very FAST! It was good and I felt bad that she had to go through that alone because he gave her a false name. I do like how their feelings never changed even though she is more cautious because of how he left and never got in touch. I do think he was faithful to her based on how he says his personal life suffered majorly because he was a workaholic and how every moment that he had away from work was filled with thinking of her. She was faithful to him because she had a son and never dated. I like when the hero and heroine only wants the other especially in this book because they both knew they had a once in a lifetime spark with the other. It was cute and fun and I was happy that he took the blame for them being apart and did not try to give blame to her for keeping his son from him like so many other heroes do even if the heroine did not know his real name."
3,"I would not say I liked or disliked this story. I don't mind a real short one once in a while. but it is really difficult with romance because I really want more character development and more time to understand their relationship. I liked the hero and heroine. but I think I am going to stick to the regular length romance. They are still a short read. between 4 and 5 hours. but the characters are so much more developed. I can't complain though as it only cost 99 cents."
3,"Four years ago Garrett Winslow and Haley Turner had a hot and heavy affair in Mexico. A tragedy took him away and he never looked back. Unfortunately. when Haley went looking for the man she fell for in Mexico she couldn't find him because he gave her a false name. Garrett has always been wary of false affections because of his wealth but he has never felt that wonderful true feeling he shared with Haley in Mexico. Now they meet again and he discovers that he left her with more than just a good time. Can he win her heart once again?The Billionaire's Baby is a short and sweet romance that is plump with emotion. Leanne Banks packs this novella with tons of heat and heart! I love Haley's stubborn nature and Garrett's relentlessness. They make a gorgeous couple and the plot is swift and endearing.Reviewed by MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"The story is short and enjoyable. Because of the length. time moves quickly. a few days covered by a few sentances to briefly explain what happened. feelings. throughts. While short. the writer has done a wonderful job with emotions. with showing how the characters changed over the four years from first meeting to finding each other again. Touching concerns. fears. wants and hope. very nicely done.Think of it as a condensed story without a lot of the fluff that is put into stories to pad the pages. The good base is there. but alot little things that would add length are not. For me. this was great. really enjoyable. I can see where others might not like it though."

3,"I do not write reviews as often as I should. however. after attempting to read this bundle. I had to review.  I have never read anything that contained more adjectives than these books.  It was absolutely unbearable. I could tell that this author had writing talent.  The story flowed well and made sense.  I found myself scanning more than reading because I couldn't deal with the overly flowery writing style.  If that type of writing is not your style. you will want to skip these books.  Following is a small example of the nonstop adjective use in these books...A bitter mountain breeze wrapped around his long frame. whipping his shaggy hair against the furrowed ridges of his brow as Jeremy Burns hiked through the Maryland forest. Like a wrathful banshee. the relentless autumn winds howled with fury. while his fellow Bloodrunner. Cian Hennessey. quietly kept pace at his side.arrrggghhhAfter reading authors like JR Ward. this type of stuff made my eyeballs roll to the back of my head."
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby . I noticed&#34; smooth line.  Rhyannon Byrd does at up just right for this one and has me convinced. I hope to read more of her books. I enjoy her style. Keep up the good work"
3,"The first concern with the paranormal romance genre is whether it is believable enough.  Could I suspend my disbelief?  Yep.  Worked for me.  I liked haveing the bundle because I plowed through these pretty fast.  Each book centers around a man who for genetic and psychological reasons is outcast but loyal.  So... this could take place in Medieval times. a police force. or on a ranch.  The conflicts and the subtle character traits are the best part.  I also like that the danger and mystery element held up.  Sometimes its just a way to get the characters in bed.  Oh. there's that too. but the human element and the well-painted scenery makes these wolves &#34;real.&#34;"
3,"The three stories were page turning. exciting. romantic and scintillating even though a bit predictable at times BUT the Jeremy and Jillian's story was the BEST!!! I Expected a little more WOLF action in the stories though. However. it was indeed Enjoyable reading.I also read Dark Wolf Rising and I am now reading Dark Wolf Running. I would love to read about the MOTHER of Eric. Eli and Elise to know her story and to find out if she had other children with her human husband and what her life is like EVEN a reunion with her children... BUT I swear if I read any of the following words again I will scream - Visceral. Guttural. Feral.... Ha ha ha!!!!Got to love Rhyannon's riveting expressions.... &#34;stroking her senses with that deep velvet-rough voice.....&#34;"
3,"Some editing issues and odd word usage... also a little contrived and heavy handed in spots.That said. despited a feeling of redundancy. I very much enjoyed this bundle as well as the fourth book. Dark Wolf Rising.HOT! HOT! HOT! Even if most of it is all tease! lolThese stories definitely got my motor running.I liked the characters. and the sub-plot running throughout the four books (though it was less of a factor in the fourth book.)The resistance/aversion push/pull is an effective device but I would have liked a bit more variation. One slightly annoying feature was how often a character decided to &#34;Go for it&#34; only to NOT go for it shortly thereafter.Still... I enjoyed them."
3,"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?  I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period.  The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to 'show' him.  I still thoroughly enjoyed the story very much."
3,"Many post apocalyptic stories are very grim. This one isn't. It has a lovely cast of characters. of beings who are trying to build new lives.The pace of the story is easy. like walk on the beach. The story starts with a wolf/human who is banished because the elders of his tribe are afraid of his ideas. On his journey he meets others: a young boy. an orphan and artist. whose body is damaged by the pollution of his former city and a female dolphin/siryn who has been helping the boy to survive and of course a very intelligent dog that they name Misschief.Many other new characters are slowly introduced.The book is infused with the love and healing power of nature. The characters are well defined and they all have a purpose. that they gradually discover."

He tells Stehvin his life story during the next couple of days. Meanwhile...... the story is fast paced. lots of new friends. and many adventures."
3,"I liked the premise behind the plot. mental attachment between wolf and man. as I like this type of interaction. Unfortunately. for me. the original promise of the plot never quite materialized and in fact ended up being chaotic for me with an unexpected side-step into shape shifting halfway through the book.For me. the book almost works well but doesn't quite make it. The plot premise didn't deliver quite what I anticipated. the characterization was a little predictable with secondary characters not well developed as individuals.I did finish the book but admit to skimming quite a lot of the last half. It wasn't a bad book. just not  my kind of read. Bland would probably be the best way to describe the book for me."
3,"Toni Blake is one of my favorite authors; great stories. well developed. likable characters. with some good sizzling sex scenes- they have always been a hit with me. This story is about Aunt Millie from 'Letters to a Secret Lover' it was very short. 35 pages. a cute. sweet read. It reminded me of the Grease era. Johnny with his ducktail hairdo and leather jacket- very reminiscent of Danny. Millie- the sheltered. virginal Sandy. The story is about how they meet and fall in love. Since it is so short. there wasn't much detail and over development. but it still worked- a good love at first sight story that takes 30 minutes to read."
3,"I thought that the hero was very annoying at first. He wanted the heroine and then went back to give his ex another try because he felt he owed it to her. The heroine then met his controlling. jack butt of a cousin when she was vulnerable from the hero and married him. A year later. her husband left with the heroine's money and best friend and the hero was no longer engaged to his ex. The hero could have saved them both a year of heart ache if he would have just stayed with the one who gave him the 'spark' he kept mentioning. but nope. he had to go back to the woman who was good for him in a robotic way. It was his fault entirely that she lost her 'fire' because his cousin drowned it out and she would never had went to the cousin if the hero did not reject her the next morning!!!"
3,"This author has written two really interesting characters with a nice supporting cast. The heroine is down-on-her-luck. but she's no week little victim. Girl's got backbone. Hero is an admirable military man. handsome. reliable. kind. an alpha without the macho. Two lonely hearts.This book sucked me in right away. ADORED the first half of this book. then it just became. predictable. and hokey. Dissapointed with the non-exsistent love scene. After the author built the sexual tension. I was left with no love scene just a morning after thought of their 'sweet loving'. Entertaining enough but it almost felt like two books. The first half tender. and deep. The second half corny and boring. Sorry not a keeper for me."
3,"The Jynx is the 4th novel I've read in my Kenneth C. Crowe marathon.  Once again I enjoyed the story.  A small bit of the supernatural does not deter me from awarding a well deserved 5 stars. A common man with somewhat uncommon intelligence seems to get into situations that can elevate him into  a life of celebrity  Crowe's protagonist is. once again. as in his other books. endowed with qualities that make him likable to this reader.  These are not serials.  Each stands on its own and the characters are fresh and exclusive.  I cannot identify a moral to this story. just as I can't say that there are no similarities with his other storylines; the ones I've read featuring a clean living protagonist whose politics lean a bit to the left and who are not adverse to a roll in the hay with a lusty female.  There's manipulation. greed. lies. and deceit. Jynx comes closest to &#34;he lived happily ever after&#34; ! ! !"

3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
3,"This is a brilliantly executed biography by a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust. He documents unimaginable horrors. He immigrated to Israel after the war. and later to the US. where he led a successful life. Had I know of this book when I taught high school history in San Diego. it would have been required reading. The book also provides an interesting history of the early settlement of Isreal. The comments by other readers regarding the poor formatting must have been fixed. I saw none and found the writing to be highly professional."
3,"I had not read a story of a survivor from Bialystok. Poland.  I had read previously read a story of a Rabbi from Bialystok. but he spent the war in Russia.  Therefore. this account was more descriptive of the cultural climate of the region.I am always amazed at how Holocaust victims survived the horrific events that were forced upon them.I will say that the formatting on the Kindle was not good.  If you are easily distracted by format issues. I would not recommend getting it on the Kindle."
3,"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII. I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save. I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust. but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost."
3,"this is a great short story about Ava and Luke. Ava is best friends with Luke's sister Jen and has been in love with him since high school but thinks he would never like her. Luke has wanted Ava just as long but neither has said anything. When the truth comes out about how they feel about each other there's no looking back. This is how a short story should be written the story line and pace worked great for this novella and though not long I cared about everyone in the book. The Ending of this book was great. I would defiantly read books from Anne Rainey again."
3,"This was a short but very hot read! I'm not going to write a plot summary here because. frankly. the story is so short that I'd be spoiling it by doing that. Suffice it to say that short stories don't always work for me. and this one did. Luke and Ava were very likable characters. and their falling in love was believable considering they'd known - and secretly lusted after - each other for 10 years. Oh. and the love scenes were sizzling hot! ;)Note: There was some light bondage but it was well done. so it didn't bother me. There was also mention of anal sex but it happens off the pages. so anyone who has a problem with that can easily skip those few lines."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
3,"Ava Sweet has had it.  She has wanted Luke McGiffin for her own since high school. When  she overhears him saying unpleasant things about her. she has something to prove.  She will make Luke want her and have him regretting his words.Will Ava get more than she bargained for?Forbidden Fruit is a great read.  Watching Luke come to terms with his feelings is wonderful.  Little did he know that a few overheard words would seal his fate.  I loved that Ava took up the challenge that Luke didn't even know he was putting out there.  Anne Rainey is always a treat to read and Forbidden Fruit is no exception.JambreaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"A little ho hum.  Joanna is a great heroine who really needs a break.  Aiden is her break.  He is a super nice guy but the I can never love again because I buried my heart with my first wife has been done to death.  He comes from a dream family with the exception of one brother who i assume will crop up in another book.  They're all kindness and light.  The good people from the church however are all mean and backstabbing.  Could someone explain to me why in all these Christian books the church goers are gossipy hags who have fun hurting peoples feelings.  Anyway it is nicely written and has some real charm going for it.  But don't expect originality."
3,"This is one of Jillian Harts better books in my opinion. It was a clean well written story that I enjoyed every bit of. The characters were strong and likable. I can not figure out why Ms. Hart feels compelled to write some of her stories filled with sexual description and others without. All of her stories are very interesting. why. then. does she feel she has to throw in the sex stuff that really. in my opinion. adds nothing to the story. in fact ruins it. Case in point. this book."
3,"I got this bundle from the library and knew there was a 4th book Tempting that I just bought and started reading. The first book in this book was sizzle which I was lost most of the time. I read fast and a lot waiting for kids at activities and I love fools gold by Susan Mallery so I kept with it then decided to look into it further and realized that I was reading the 3rd book first. I never usually do that as 90% you can tell and are lost.  I loved the series when I read them in the correct order and went back to read sizzle and it was so much better after reading the first 2 books. I have purchased and read lots of bundles and they are never out of order."
3,"Another amazing installment in the PsyCop series. I'm just going to get gushier and gushier in each review because I love each serving of this series that Jordan Castillo Price dishes out. I am fascinated by Vic and his history. and this book gave us yet another peek into what makes him tick. The characters are all so well developed that I can picture each and every one of them. and I feel like I know them personally.This book in particular kept me guessing and kept me on my toes. It was that delicious combination of sexiness. humor. mystery. and paranormal that lands right on my ultimate sweet spot. I am ignoring all of my books on my to-read shelf to plow through this series. This book was a bit meatier than the one before it and I have ridiculously high hopes for the next in the series."
3,"This one was my least favorite. I was so scared the author was gonna follow the same protocol of the cut and run series and ruin my life in the process.Jealousy and cheating are so not appealing to me. I have hated Crash since he first appeared exactly because of how much he threatens the whole story. And seeing Jacob doing what he did in this book made me hate him with a passion. I didn't think him and Crash were all that friendly towards each other anyway.Our Vic is acting like a brat too. trying to control other peoples lives. More specifically: Lisa. The infamous lisa who disappeared on us and now wants to be a part of the story once again. Make up your mind!The plot was pretty solid though just when I think I've seen creepy this writer shows something even creepier.And the boys are so busy with the new loft and work too. But going strong."
3,"Everyone today seems to be aware of the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz but only because of the film made in the 1930's starring Judy Garland. The film was fairly faithful to the story but differed in some ways. The entire collection of the Oz stories is a splendid read for today's children. All of the characters are amazing and some of the stories would make really exciting motion pictures with plenty of action and some really terrifying scenes. The book. Rinkitink in Oz. is one of these. It would make a great video game! I highly recommend these books to everyone. young and old. It was wonderful to read them all again and I am so glad to have this collection on my Kindle!"
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
3,"46.220 locations - 14 stories.  Active Table of Contents.  Just an incredible value.If you have a Kindle and like to read at all. and why do you have a Kindle if you don't want to read. I highly recommend giving this a try.  I don't recall what I paid for it. but it's 14 full stories about Oz by the original author.  Currently for less than a dollar.  I have to adjust the size down one for this book. compared to most others. but that is a tiny complaint.If all you know about Oz is the original movie. give this a try and find a more complicated world and characters then you thought.  Love the author's notes."
3,"Re-discovering all of Frank L Baum's 'Oz' books has been a hoot.  I read as many as I could get my hands on as a child; and so decided to check this one out on my new Kindel.  It's a lot of fun.  But no illustrations -- which are part of the fun of reading those books -- so that was a bit of a disappointment --  some misspelling and some dropped words from page to new page - but not so much that you cannot figure out what was supposed to be there.  I'd buy it in a hardcopy rather than Kindel edition. just to explore the illustrations (historical and fun in and of themselves)."
3,"Number of illustrations promised before purchase: 10Number of illustrations visible on my Kindle: 0Good part: the Table of Contents works for me.  I can go forward and back to next book (but not next chapter).Bad part: giant lump of text is tedious to read without any pictures.This edition includes the text of 14 books plus one bonus book: Wogglebug's adventures in the real world.  The Wogglebug book is dreadful and not worth reading.This edition is good if you have already read the Oz books and are re-reading them for your own pleasure (i.e. not reading them to someone else).  Otherwise. sorry. losing the pictures really takes away from the experience."
3,"I know that last part of my title sounds weird but it's true. Children will love the simplistic adventures of Dorothy and friends while fan of Tim Burton will wonder why he hasn't requested the rights to make these into movies. Baum imagination truly runs a little too wild at times.With characters such as a sawhorse made of wood. a glass kitten with pink brains (you can see them work!) and the Hungry Tiger who prefers the taste of babies but won't eat them because of his conscience you gotta wonder if Baum and Burton are related in any way.Either way. for only $0.99 it's worth your time.OH. but don't expect pictures! The description promises you illustrations but it's a lie. No illustrations were found in my copy. Just blank pages where they were supposed to be."
3,"I had never read any of the Oz books except the Wonderful WIzard of Oz.  I'd seen the Judy Garland movie several times and frankly gotten a little tired of it.  I'd seen a TV movie with new characters but had not realized there were further adventures actually written by Baum.  These are written for children but everything is so fresh and new they are great fun reads for adults. too.  I'm only part way through the entire collection but am having a great time following Dorothy's adventures in the different worlds.  Not all take place in Oz - so far. I've traveled to Ev (across the great desert from Oz) and a land underground inhabited by people who are vegetables and not particularly nice ones."
3,"the first time i got the books i got all 14 of them for free for my kindles but i kept mixing them up and had to use a cheat sheet to get them back in order. until i found this. i bought a copy for me then i bought one for my mom thinking she would read it. i dont mind that there are no pictures but it doesnt matter. when you read the books you make your own pictures in your mind to go along with the story. if you love the books and want to keep them in order then you should get this book. its less than $1 and worth it. there are 3 more books that you can get for free that tie into the Oz series. if you would like to know what they are i will let you know"
3,"Right and wrong are not always obvious. 'Vengeance' follows Owen Dunham. who is investigating the trail of a figure who is called the 'Grudge Ninja'. With little lead on the Ninja's motives. he is shocked when he does start to learn of the truths. and begins to doubt the integrity of his lead. The Grudge Ninja's methods may be wrong. but could its mission be right? 'Vengeance' is a thriller that dwells in shades of gray with many different characters with different motives and codes. highly recommended."
3,"Suspend belief and settle in for a fast read with this serial killer action/mystery that is relatively bloody/graphic and still manages to be entertaining with occasional touches of humor.It has to be the characterization that does it for me in this one as the storyline follows two serial killers out for vengeance against mob killers and the  agent in charge of the national task force to apprehend them and his wife.I tend to not identify with sadistic serial killers but in this case the author manages to tweak the plotline so the reader hopes they don't get caught. In some ways. it reminds me of the way Thomas Perry manages this with his contract killer in 'The Butcher's Boy'. Different premise and very different characters but all the same you know you shouldn't want them to get away. but you do.Definitely over the top but very well done and entertaining."
3,"When I read the book description. I thought this would be an interesting read. as a story about a married couple discovering their 'forbidden' desires and kinks is right up my alley. but when I opened the ebook and realized it was a short story. I had to lower my expectations. Still. I thought it could be good. because skilled authors can make almost anything work.Sadly. that wasn't the case here. The story's premise was never developed into anything resembling a plot. The book description was the whole story. or better. the setup for the sex scene where Roake's and Jenesta's hidden sexual needs were revealed. I've read and enjoyed stories like that (aka smut) before and I'm sure I'll read and enjoy others in the future. so why didn't I like this one? It all comes down to Roake and Jenesta. I'm afraid. I didn't 'connect' with them so I found myself indifferent to their sex scene and HEA."
3,"I bought this at the Samhain website (had a coupon from the RWA conference) and was extremely impressed. This was my first reading of this author and I thought she did a fantastic job for a short story. In fact I was just up here on Amazon looking for something else of hers to read and saw that this book has only a 3 star rating... shocked me into writing my own review!The other reviews have done a good job of recounting the plot here. so I'll just say that I think the story was very well written. dark and steamy with a nicely executed HEA. It stumbled a little bit at the black moment. but not enough to throw me off.If the story sounds intriguing to you. give it a shot. She's a wonderful writer."
3,"I read this book a few weeks ago and I guess I forgot to write a review.  Shame on me.  Anyway. I loved this book.  Hunter may have appeared to be a beast. however not because of his looks.  It was his beastly attitude. but I loved him anyway.  I was able to see behind the facade and so was Lila.  This was a modern days spin of Beauty and the Beast and Indecent Proposal.  I loved it. Eve Vaughn wove a wonderful story of two people with their own issues and demons who come together for selfish purposes only to find true love.  It was a definite page turner for me and I would most definitely recommend it.For those who are critical of the Hero's dominance. attitude and control over the heroine. I will only this....READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE BUYING THE BOOK....DUH IT TELLS YOU WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE STORY PLOT. WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED!!  Kudos Ms. Vaughn on a job well done!!"
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
3,"When I first started reading this romance. the guy in it seemed too superficial and uncaring to be interesting or likable. I guess that was part of his beast persona. because as I read further and learned more about him. he just seemed human and vulnerable.  I thought the author did a pretty good job of writing a modern Beauty and the Beast story.  It was nice too that the Beauty character in the story was a black woman with the beast being blonde. which makes a nice change from the cliche' ofblack men being with white blonde women.Of course Lila who was 'Beauty' was as beautiful inside as outside.  In the original fairy tale. the beast has a bad temper  as part of his curse. so having the 'beast' in this story be bad tempered goes along with that."
3,"This story was phenomenal.  I didn't know what to expect going into this story.  For some reason I thought this book was about something else. but in any event I loved it.  In a nutshell Lila agrees to be Hunters mistress in order to save her father's business.  Hunter propositions her because he had been disfigured due to an accident and doesn't think he can get female companionship without making them some type of deal.  Lila thinks she hates him because in order to save her father's business she has to bend to his will.  She's ashamed of her circumstances but can't deny she enjoys the things that he does to her body.  Hunter is always in control when it comes to there love making.  It's however and whenever he says.  The sex scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!  Hunter and Lila eventually fall in love and get their happily ever after. Definitely 5 stars!!!"
3,"PLOT: Lila's father is going to lose his business. Lila can tell the stress is affecting her father's health. So she goes off to confront the man who's responsible. Hunter takes one look at her and is immediately attracted. His mistress had just left him because of scars he sustained to his face in a car accident. Hunter proposes a deal. If she'll become his mistress for three months. he'll stop trying to ruin her father's business.PROS: Lila and Hunter are likable. Their chemistry is HOT. The author does a good job of developing these characters so that you really get to care about them. Excellent plot and story development will keep you hooked.CONS: None.5 STARS: Mistress to the Beast is a great romance. If you liked Beauty & the Beast. you're sure to enjoy this modern spin on the story."
3,"I gave this book three stars based solely on the fact that it was well written. meaning that grammar and spelling were on point and that the story flowed fairly well. But for me. I think basing this book on the Disney story of beauty and the beast was a bit juvenile. As were parts of the story. Things came to a head much too quickly for it to have been believable and the heroine going from. &#34;I hate this guy&#34; to &#34;well. I guess I can give him a chance&#34; was too much for me to take in. Overall. I thought this book was corny beyond belief and makes me wonder if other books the author has written as like this one. Honestly. the hero tells the heroine. &#34;teach me how to heal.&#34; Seriously?! It's a bit much to take."
3,"No love here. If you are looking for a quick tale of lust with LOTS of sexually explicit language. go for it! If you are like me and don't mind a good sex scene as long as it means something. than this book will be just as disappointing for you. It was a short book. author's writing style. not bad. Premise not so bad. but for me the lust never really evolved for me. Hero started out as a rich selfish bastard. and did not change enough for me. Not enough love or depth of character."
3,"I enjoyed this book.  I've read reviews on it where some said they were offended by the fact that 'a black woman could be sold to a white man'.  The story wasn't anything dirty like that.  And. that would be a fair argument if this wasn't a plot that has been used many times by writers with characters being the same race and. no one complained.  So. to those people I say don't read IR books if you're against IR relationships."
3,"I'm not fairy tales redux. but I thoroughly enjoyed this book and gobbled it up in one sitting. This was a great turn on the Beauty and the Beast plot.the sex scenes were hot and I actually like both the hero and the heroine.Don't get me wrong I wanted to slap the hero's face a time of four due to immature and often cruel behavior. but the author did such a great job with developing Hunter's character and weaving in his reasons for acting like a tyrant that I forgave him in pretty much the same vein as the heroine.  And he really redeemed himself at the end.Of course it was hard to stomach the heroine's self-sacrifice. but if she didn't then this book wouldn't have been a take on Beauty and the Beast.  So. I totally bought it and her not wanting to have sex with him but liking it because when she firsts meets him she's instantly attracted to him.This was another great read from Eve Vaughn."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
3,"Mistress to the Beast is one of my all time favorite books of any genre.Eve Vaughn created a tale that drew you in from the beginning. The relationship between Hunter and Lila is complicated and beautiful.  Even with Hunter's less than upstanding characteristics. you feel a sort of empathy for him and you want him to come out on top.  Lila provides the perfect contrast to Hunter's brute demeanor by being a loving. understanding partner.  And did I mention the love scenes?  HOT!!!!  I would recommend this book to any fan of ir/erotica."
3,"I have to admit. I figured this book was an erotic version of 'Beauty and the Beast'. but I was surprised that I enjoyed this story more than I thought I would.  Lila. a nurse. compromises herself in order to help her father keep his store.  Hunter is a very wealthy developer whose car accident has left him disfigured and often times cruel.  At first I had a hard time with Hunter.  I have to say. I'm not usually one for stories where the 'Hero' is more of a beast than man. but after reading this story. I realized that Hunter never knew true love. and was never really shown it. It was a little rough in the beginning. but I can't lie...the sex was HOT HOT HOT!! For something different. and if you can have an open mind. I think you would enjoy this story."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"Since I mostly listened rather than read the book. I have no complaint to make about the editing. Beyond that. however. was the absence of any sense of reality with regard to characters and situations. Without revealing specific situations to the person who will read the book. things happen which cannot possibly be the behavior of  Good Guys. other acts cannot be believed of any police force anywhere in the United States. and. the Bad Guys are caricatures with little credibility.Missed most is the absence of any depth in the characters. None are convincing as feature or even walk-on real people. Only two subordinate players are given any degree of life.The action itself is a confused mish-mash of tech-talk and violence with the Good Guys equipped with with super-gadgetry and the Bad Guys stand-ins from old Keystone Cops routines.No doubt it will please some who. in this instance. are prepared to be generous."
3,"I enjoyed this book.  It is not your typical adventure novel. since it takes place in Iowa and Nebraska (not your your typical hot spots of high adventure criminal activity) and the protagonists aren't special operators.  It is a fun read. and I hope Mr. O'Kane makes a series of it.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers. but I would recommend reading it - especially if you get it on a day it is free or you can get it for $0.99.  I love finding gems for those prices."
3,"This was one very good book.  It will draw you in. then it won't let you go until the problems have been resolved.  I will read more by Kevin O'Kane.  His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing.  Besides misspellings and incorrect usage. this one has many compound words written separately as two.  The pictures on the 'milk cartoons' was the last straw; 'milk cartoons' was referred to several times.  Spellcheck is not an editor.  Though I've become much more lenient over the years. constantly rereading a sentence to decipher it is sometimes intolerable.  This detracts from the flow of the unfolding events.  It is sad to ruin what otherwise is a great read."
3,"I have never read this author but I thoroughly enjoyed this story and would gladly read another.The disfigured Hero's fear. pain and pride were wonderfully described and I felt myself wanting to reach out and gently touch his scars to reassure him -at exactly the same times Aidan touched Warwick. Don't get me wrong. Warwick was a brutally strong hot male character-but we were so privy to his thoughts within this story that we began to get those protective feelings Aidan acquired. We saw the extremely handsome man Warwick really was.The passion and romace are well mixed with so much strengh and wit from both characters that sometimes you're not sure who the real Hero should be in this story.For everyone who likes the strong-take matters into her own hands Heroines--this is definately the book for you! She is a one WOMAN rescue squad that is the perfect match for our mysterious- masked hired guard Warwick. The sex between them is hot and wicked as well.enjoy!"
3,"This was a free kindle book that I got a couple of months ago. When I read the product description it didn't seemed like something I would like.  But I love to read different authors and genres. and I ended up surprised.  Don't normally like things that are in this setting - planets and space.  However. the setting doesn't impact the story at all - the only real mention is when they are traveling.The heroine. Aidan. is a pilot trying to help her degenerate brother. an addicted gambler. The hero. Warwick. is an enforcer with only vengeance keeping him going.The author set the two characters up well and the romance between them was well written.  This short story is a great jumping off point - I am looking forward to other installments in this series.  I am glad I took a chance and downloaded this book while it was free - otherwise I would have pass up a good read."
3,"I loved this title!  It's fun. sexy. very entertaining.The heroine is feisty. not falling all over the Hero. her own person.  She's not mooning over oh lover where art thou?  I like a no (or not too much) nonsense heroine that doesn't pout. cry over nothing. cringe. and otherwise wimp out.  She can give a punch and take a punch after all this is an adventure.  A tough cookie who doesn't mind enjoying one hot hunky guy without agonizing over it.The Hero is long suffering and on the heroine's side.  There are lots of bad guys and lots of double crossing.  It's just a good light read.  I did not think there was too much sex. it was appropriate to the story and relationship.  I happen to like space romances and this is a good one.I will read more of this writer."
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
3,"This book is apparently part of a trilogy(Red Hot Summer)that you can purchase all together. I am not fond of stories were the girl has to excessively chase the guy. but it was a nice change. and the guy did some chasing of his own in the end. The steamy scenes were hot enough and the emotion was there. but there was a lack of description about the characters features. I still don't know what color hair or eyes they had? It might have been in there but it was to quick and I missed it. Either way I still enjoyed this short story. Enjoy!"
3,"Shelby Harper is bakery and cafe owner near Naval base. Shelby has been flirting with Navy SEAL John Garrett(Garrett) for the past year. When Shelby over hears conversation between Garrett and Carson Scott that she might be a prude in the bedroom. She sets out to prove both of them wrong. When Shelby declares she wants a threesome with Garrett and Carson. they are floored yet Garrett is extremely nervous. Will Shelby prove them wrong? Will Garrett finally admit his feelings for Shelby? Your answers await you in Heat of the Moment.Out of Uniform Series starts out with a bang. Both Shelby and Garrett have liked each other for over a year but neither has made a move in the romance department. Shelby is sweet and smart and definitely knows what she wants~Garrett. Garrett is alpha male that needs a little push in the right direction but once there all bets are off. I look forward to continuing this series."
3,"Kennedy knew what she was doing when she sat down and wrote this book.  The character John Garrett is just super sexy and to pair him with his Navy SEAL buddy Carson. yummers!  Throw in a woman who overhears that these two men thinks she probably only has `vanilla sex' and you got yourself a steamy book. I don't want to give too much away about this book because it is a quick read but this book made me go out and purchase the rest of the Out of Uniform series that I didn't have.~BookWhisperer Reviewer MC~"
3,"This book really turns up the heat. If you can't handle or don't like books that involve sexual relations. then do not read this book. I really enjoyed this story. it was very interesting to read about. The romance part was pretty good. but I wish there was more. I know it's a novella. but I would have really liked to have seen more from it. There was more sexual aspects to the book than actual romance which I didn't like. Me having read book 2 first. book 2 had a lot more romance development in it. But overall. I did enjoy the story and it really brought some flaming heat! I can't wait to continue on with the series. because I love books dealing with military men :)"
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
3,"When you read Elle Kennedy. you know what you are getting. Fire-starting heat!  What a great way to start a series-- &#34;vanilla. sweet girl&#34; meets SEAL with a reputation for being a ladies man and rumors of kink and threesomes. They lust after each other for a year without the other knowing - and that's when the story begins.  Shelby proves she is not as vanilla and John Garrett thinks by having a threesome with Garrett and his buddy. Carson.Definitely a wonderful love story and the characters are beginning to be developed. I assume they will be in future books in the series. I will feel let down if they aren't.  The sex scenes and descriptions are NOT for the innocent- Elle Kennedy doesn't hold back! Hot!"
3,"Simon he may be the beta of the Pride but that boy is fierce when it comes to his woman. 'if I find yout that you had a hand in helping Livia hurt my mate I will kick your a** so hard you'll s*** out of your mouth after I have you cast out of the Pride. You understand me?' He's just a big kitty where Becky is concerned. 'Simon was purring. She ran her hands soothingly up and down his back. making him purr even louder. She bit her lip to keep from giggling.' The man has no shame when it comes to sharing a bathroom. 'he looks at her. confused. He pointed with the toothbrush. 'Toilet's right there. baby.' I'm excited for Adrian's book."
3,"So maybe I have read too many m&eacute;nage stories but this just story just did not work for me. I realize it is a short story so not a lot of character development or background but to me Cassie just came off as kinda whiny and wimpy....yes you're in love with your two best friends. and yes. you see them getting it on. you obviously were not that good of friends if you ran off with no explanation or confronting them about it (or maybe I am expecting the character to do what I would do which is call them on it...not that I have ever been in love with two people equally or at the same time....) so while I normally like this author this one just did not do it for me. I guess I like my heroines a bit stronger...."
3,"Too many menage stories seem to be kind of wish fulfillment. with the idea that the heroine is so desirable that she's irresistible.  There was a little of that here. but it wasn't overwhelming. and it was very much a love story.  I liked that the two men had clearly built themselves a life together. maybe not completely without regret. but with the idea that they were a couple.  This is nice after reading way too many stories where the male characters are forlornly waiting for a third to complete them. who is always your typical plucky modern heroine.  Usually with an abusive ex-husband.  One gets tired of that."
3,"I am not one to give bad reviews but I could not get into this book.  The sex was hot.  I am not too into m/m sex but in this book it wasn't bad.  you could actually feel for both men.  But Cassie's character I did not like.  She comes into town after being engaged for 10 months and within 5 mins is having sex with Kyle & she was pretty much the one making it happen.  I did not like all her self doubts.  I guess the last chapter was the best in the book.  So all & all it was an okay read but not happy I spent money on it."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
3,"Wow! I loved this novella so much. I bought the rest of Tuttle's books right away. The cover leads you to think these books are more Dresden Files (which I also LOVE to read). but don't let them fool you. Markhat is not Harry Dresden. I have loved Glen Cook's Garrett. PI books for years - eagerly awaiting every new one. Well. now there is able successor in Frank Tuttle's Markhat. A bit darker (what's not to love?). but just as lightly humorous with an interesting cast of fantasy characters living side by side with humans. No spoilers here - go buy the books yourself (make Tuttle some money. ok? He needs to buy more depilatory) and plan to read them all. one after the other. If you like gritty fantasy with a mystery. these books are for you. Frank Tuttle. get writing - we want more Markhat!"
3,"I've had this book since October 2011. It's now mid-March 2012. and I've only just read it today.I have to say. for the first page and a half. I really did wonder what I was reading. but very quickly the quirky writing and the tongue-in-cheek hunour took over. and I was caught!Trolls. Vampires. a man who finds things and a neighbour who is some sort of voodoo witch crossed with a look-out... This was great fun. Delighted to give this five stars. and hope that if you ever have a few hours and need a good short with no pretence of the irony and curious humour that fantasy can sometimes throw at you. this is a great place to start!"
3,"I loved this novella/short story.  I got 'Dead Man's Rain' first for free when it was offered for the Kindle. but I went to Frank Tuttle's website because I wanted to read his works in this series in order.  I got the sample and loved it and since it was only 2 dollars. I couldn't resist it.  Anyone who wants a slightly silly and fun trip through a world where mythological and fantasy creatures really exist alongside people. should read this bok because this is the book for you.  I would say it's even ok for children. at least this one. because there's nothing hugely graphic spelled out except for mention of blood and people getting hit.  I will start Dead Man's Rain shortly."
3,"Very. very funny. with the clever twist of having intelligent trolls that are a part of a functioning society.  My wife (whose Amazon account I am hacking since I do not have one of my own) starting downloading Tuttle's books on the Kindle and we are both in the process of flying through the entire catalogue.  This is one of the funnier books that I have read in a long time. set in a fantasy world that does not conform to the normal archetypes of the various creatures normally found in such worlds.  Get this story and enjoy it."
3,"As I wrote in my review of Frank Tuttle's other Markhat the finder work. Dead Man's Rain. I really enjoy reading about Markhat the detective and his crazy noir fantasy-world of trolls. half-dead vampires. sooth-sayers. and humans.  I got Dead Man's Rain for free but actually paid the $2 for this 'book' after finishing Rain and wanting more Markhat.  I put book in quotations because both stories are very. very short.  Adding to the vexation of getting to the end of a short piece of fiction and wanting more. the last 20% or so of the Kindle editions of both Markhat works consist of previews of other Samhain Publishing books which are not even written by Frank Tuttle.  This was very disappointing to say the least.Still. I would pay full price for a FULL-LENGTH Markhat book if it were available for the Kindle."
3,"So we get to learn more about markhat's past here. and it's a perfect past for him. Also one that had me reaching for the kleenex. thanks a bunch.The usual high quality writing. with a touch more personal stuff about the character. all very well written and perfectly suitable to the story. It can actually be very difficult to find things to say about very well-wrotten books. and that's the trouble I'm having now; there are no flaws to pick apart. no criticisims to be found. It's a solid short about an interesting character with well-done side characters and good imagery. So far. it's one of the best fantasy series I've read."
3,"I felt this story was too short. too short on character development. too short on descriptions. too short on what this guy actually did and what time period it was.  I know a lot of books don't ever tell you when they take place. but I kept wondering throughout.Why there were trolls and other creatures? What did they have to do with the story?  A lot of questions that were never answered.I had no problem with reading the book. and it is nicely formatted for the Kindle. I just think what makes a so-so book better is lush and full descriptions and making sure the reader knows about your characters.  I thought this book lacked those characteristics."
3,"Novella length urban fantasy along the lines of Butcher's Dresden.I like this authors style. It has such a devil may care attitude to it and that is exactly how he has written his main character. With the debonnaire flair of  an outcast gentleman and the sarcastic wit of a person who doesn't give a flying monkey what anyone says or thinks.A few minor errors. one being the use of the word reign instead of reins.Other than that this is quite an excellent read. just a shame it isn't a full length novel. Saying that though novellas often feel 'interrupted' for wont of a better word and this doesn't. it fits snugly and ends well. Like the first cup of coffee in the morning.It just feels right.AVP-UK"
3,"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions. curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter. more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect."
3,"As with The Mister Trophy. I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as 'haint'. which is a ghost.  I really love the characters. but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good. but short. fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."
3,"Disclaimer: I got this for my Kindle when it was being given away for free.  It now is up to $2.80 but my review takes into account what I paid.I like Markhat the finder. a hard-boiled ex-military gumshoe in a fantasy land where trolls. vampires. and other creatures of the night interact with humans.  This novella/short story has some great dialog and I truly wish it had been longer.  I even paid $2.00 for another Markhat book. The Mister Trophy. hoping for more of the same and while it was equally as good as this book it was also equally as short.  If I consider the combined content of both books and consider the $2 I paid for them. I still rate them 5 stars.Apparently there is a third. longer Markhat book out now which for some reason isn't available for the Kindle.  Come on Frank. what are you and Samhain waiting for?"
3,"This book was a surprise for me.  I have had it on my Kindle for awhile but the synopsis did not catch my interest.  I was going to archive it without reading it but decided to give it a fast cursory run through.  It caught and held my attention.  I finished it in one sitting.The butler and the protagonist were the most interesting characters.  During the storm the action was a little confusing but that did not detract from the over all read.  Being a teacher I just had to make note of grammatical/typo  errors.  There were no egregious errors that detracted from the story.Is it me or do the Kindle editions of books have more errors than the paperback/hardbound books?  I have wanted to literally compare a Kindle edition to the paperback version. Guess I am too cheap and/or too busy to do this.  One day I will summon up enough interest/motivation to do this experiment."
3,"'SPOILERS'I just got done reading all three books in the Vaughn series that are currently available and enjoyed all three of them.  My main issue with this one however is how quickly Candice gets over her experience of being raped...in one weekend she goes from barely being able to cope with talking to people at the gym. to sleeping with the hero...and it just seems as though it moves a bit too quickly...but the book was a good read and i'm eagerly awaiting the next one in the series due out early next year about their cousin Grace"
3,"This is the first book I've read by Ally Blue and it won't be the last. I enjoyed this story immensely even if it was on the light side. There was little to no background or buildup. but somehow it worked as a short story about two very sweet people. I like the heroes this author created. they were good and kind people. even though there were some fights and arguments. they worked things out. I was not a fan of the whole developer and corrupt city officials part of the story but luckily for me. that was only a brief part of the whole story. I enjoyed this very much and would recommend it to others as a hot. romantic MM read."
3,"It was an easy couple of hour read for me that was pleasant enough for a free book.  It's the same old story though. a young couple lose their lives leaving an orphaned child to a rich sibling to take care of.  It was just a bit sad at times all the references to the deceased couple but turned out HEA and the child very much loved. The author has a nice writing style. this is my second book by her and I'll be looking for other free ones.  Enjoy"
3,"I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason. he thought. but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read."
3,"By Gwen S. .San Marcos CA... We are finally reading  the tale about Anna G. . the third saga of the Women of Brambleberry House. Sage's and Julia's sagas were well written  with well developed characters  and story plots but in Soldier's Secret. I felt disconnected with Anna's personna so my interest in reading this book to its conclusion waned exponentially as I plodded through  it but I read it to the very end...I did! Max. Abigail's wounded veteran /nephew. on the other hand captured my sympathy as a recently wounded. helio-flying medic/ veteran in recovery phase. And Abigail. even in death. managed to get Anna and Max together as a couple with the help of Conan. the mutt. Anticlimatic story to the trilogy."
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
3,"I bought this set and returned it.  I couldn't force myself to finish the first book. A Touch of Silk.  ( They are bundled out of order. too).  The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!  But the pages and pages of supposedly erotic fantasy stuffing the book to bring up the word count was the final blow.  No character development. not enough background.  What should have been interesting read like a pre- teen fantasy.  Don't waste your money."
3,"This book was a little slow in the beginning. but once the killing started. I had a hard time putting it down.  The kindle edition is a little rough due to some formatting problems. but it was definitely readable.  Williams does a great job with character definition and more than makes up for what the book lacks in plot.  The author's descriptions of violence are so well done that it is easy to visualize the gory details.  For fans of gratuitous violence. this book does not disappoint!"
3,"...with a twist of goth and one seriously bad serial killer!This book really held my interest all the way through. but then the ending came and went in a flash.  With so much build up. I would have thought the ending would take longer to complete itself - not so.The detail given to describe the setting of each scene was incredible.  Also. you were provided deep insight into the characters. even the lesser ones.  There was nothing vague about this book.Formatting was off. but it wasn't too distracting after a while."
3,"This book has a good basic storyline.  However. I found the writing to be of a rather jerky and staccato style. especially in the descriptive areas.  It was rather difficult to follow at times as it jumps around a bit and with the formatting problems (quite a few) I found myself trying to figure out where I was in the story. It took me longer to read than it should have because of that. Reformatting would definitely help you keep track of what is happening. I did feel that there were a few things that could have been left out of the story as they really weren't incorporated into the storyline very well. just seemed to be thrown in because you have to be explicit about some things (x-rated).  Thank goodness for the fast page turnings on the Kindle! Even with all this. I still wanted to keep reading to find out what happened."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
3,"This was an excellent. fast paced story that I didn't want to put down.There is a small issue with formatting that I almost deducted a star for. but I just couldn't do it as it did not hinder my reading much at all. It's only a matter of sentences dropping to a new line in the middle and not having page breaks between chapters.  Annoying. but not debilitating.The characters here are vivid and believable. The writing is succinct and graphic.This was a steal for $.99. I will definitely be watching out for more from this author."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
3,"There were a few things that I liked singularly in this story. especially the friend-to-lovers theme and the fact that Will. who is the quiet guy. had an unexpected dominant streak. but this fact was also what brought me out of the story a bit. because I see the book is tagged BDSM and I didn't really feel it as a theme of the book. There's also something that made me almost mad: Will's colleague is expecting him for dinner to set him up with her brother. he knows he has to go. but then he is caught up in his confrontation with Ethan and that fact is not mentioned anymore. I know one can't expect everything to be tied up. but what was the point? There was something good and intense in the story. but there was also something over-the-top and not deep enough. It's probably more 2.5*. but I liked Will a lot. so I'll bump it up a bit."
3,"I was completely hooked on this book from beginning to end.  The writing is excellent. the story well-told with depth of character. and description that doesn't leave you confused - but doesn't go on and on to the point of boring you.I honestly couldn't put it down except when forced. (funny how they think you ought to work at work. instead of reading... harrumph) and was constantly thinking about it when not reading.I was SO happy with the ending!  It wasn't utterly predictable. it wasn't too easy. and I felt like justice was served.  Beautiful combination. yes?I look forward to reading Collateral Damage by Austin Camacho. now.  Hannibal Jones is a guy to follow."
3,"I enjoyed this book so much!  Loved the main hero Hannibal Jones!  What an Alpha Male Hero!  I was so busy turning the pages that my poor husband had to do all the chores!  The suspense never let's up!  The action is well planned!  It is a taut. fast pace action thriller with just enough of romance interweaved!  I loved the fact that that the author. Mr Camacho. made Hannibal a very human hero. who wins a few and loses a few!  For fans of Action Thrillers this is a book well worth reading!  I am definitely a FAN!"
3,"Dragon Knights. Border Lair. Book 2 in the series. This book can be read alone. but is better if you start with the prequel The Dragon Healer or Book 1 Maiden Flight.  This book follows Belora's. Maiden Flight. mother Adora who has been reunited with her childhood friend and adopted mother Kelzy the dragon.  Adora finds love with her 2 Knights and there Dragon Partners.  The broad story line continues to unfold at a nice pace.  After reading this book. I was engaged enough in the story that I picked up the rest of the series to date. Keeper of the Flame."
3,"I really enjoyed this 2nd book of the Dragon Knight series. This picked up from where Maiden Flight ended and the transition was very well handled. The storyline of Belora's (Maiden Flight) mother. Adora finding love after she has been a widow for 10 years is wonderful particularly when the man she meets is also a widower who lost his family. The meddling of the dragons is cute and very astute.The only fault I found was the story of her lost twin daughters being told several times. yes. it did move the story forward but it could have been better condensed.The introduction of new characters was handled well and the enemy king and his plans was well thought out and a great plot twist.  Well done.... I'm on to the next book Ice Dragon - can't wait!"
3,"Another great read in this series. I absolutely loved the first one and had to have the second and I was not disappointed. If anything it had only hooked me on this series even more. I love the characters and how everything interacts and flows together. It's written really well and I'm able to just immerse myself in the story and the world that has been created and I don't want to leave. even when the book is done. There is plenty of action in this story to keep your attention.  Now to get the next one :)."
3,"Cade wants Mollie and wonders what she is doing marrying the jerk from high school. When Mollie catches her fiance not only putting her down but also cheating she decides she has her own brand of revenge have Cade bring out her inner bad girl. Cade agrees but what he really wants is more from Mollie he wants it all from her. The way these two tear up the sheets is smoking hot but the fact that neither of them know how much of the others heart is involved keeps you with it to see if they will figure it out. not bad for the price definitely worth the read"
3,"I keep buying these books. The last one(sweeter than wine) was a vast improvement. There was a story line! There was character development!! Finally one of the books has some meat!!! I was excited for the next installment! Then I read it.......and it fell flatter than a fifth graders training bra. Especially when I finished it in about 45 min. And we skip about 2 years. And we go from I love you. to vows. to babies. to a year later...in about 20 pages....c'mon bianca. youre better than this."
3,"CONSUMED showcases the ability of Moira McTark (aka Mira Lyn Kelly) to write realistic characters. VERY witty dialogue and STEAMY scenes.Amber Grayson has had a crush on Brian Matthers since high school.  Although they never got together. he represents her ideal man.  This story is about what happens when they meet on the train coming home from work.'So. what`s your stop?' he asked. smiling a little too platonically for her taste.''She said a silent prayer. begging the LUST FAIRIES to accost him at full throttle.''Taking a deep breath. he wondered how he was going to get through dinner without crawling under the table and pressing his face to her...'My one issue would be that the problems Amber has with Eric are resolved in a too simplistic fashion.If you enjoyed this novel. check out  WAKING UP MARRIED. ONCE IS NEVER ENOUGH. and THE S BEFORE EX."
3,"A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line. I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes. with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber. their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian. but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice. hot. hunky. hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?"
3,"It was okay but since it was neither of their faults that they were separated. the story was redundant. They said the same things over and over again. Plus. she says the dress she was wearing at one point was perfect for the summer day it was but it was set at Christmas time. Ms. Darcy needs a better editor. It also bugs me that the hero had been with other women but since he thought he was betrayed. I am not as upset by that then I would be if they were just apart for other reasons. I still like my couples to stay faithful to one another during their separations. He also told her he thought of her when he was with other women because they never made him feel what he felt with her. Ummm... is that supposed to be sweet??? It is not!!"
3,"After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the book. but was disappointed how quickly the heroine fell into her x-lovers arms.  His father was ruthless and even knowing his son was in love he set him up to destroy the relationship.  He didn't even know he had a son - after 6 years!!!  I will say that once he made the effort nothing - even his parents - stood in his way of restoring what he had lost out on - the first 5 years of his son's life."
3,"Nothing better than a rip roaring family stand-off to spice up weekend reading. Luc father. Maurizio is a dinosaur hell-bent on his version of Greek tradition being honoured. though he himself is far less honourable in his methods.Luc is gutted by his brother's  and father's betrayal of his love for Skye. not to mention the son they hid from him and comes in guns blazing to a blistering. scorching confrontation with Maurizio. And bluntly defies his family to woo back the love of his life and their son.Lots of layers to unpeel. more blistering showdowns for this family to work their way through. I love this alpha male. prepared to defy and dis-own his Greek family to put Skye and Matt first. And I love that Skye makes Luc earn the right to her trust and love but she also grows to understand the tenacious pride of culture and traditions. despite being far from home.Very satisfying - one of the few novels to survive another culling from my library."
3,"This book was great it doesnt seem like i could find words to describe how happy I am I bought this book.This book is very emotional it has it all. love. pain. sadness. fear. forgiveness and family.Love of not only of Luc and Skye. but love for family. of a mother to her child. love of siblings and love of tradition. Pain of betreyal is sompalpable in the beginning i honestly dont know how skye could forgive but i understood that her love for Luc was to great that she doesnt want him to loose anything. For me it was very couragious of her to face her fear of meeting Luc's father who caused her so much pain.I know this review is very criptic but i want u guys to read it. It very worth it."
3,"It was a happy ending. He messed up and he groveled a bit for her. He knew what he had done was hurtful to her and he had to build up her trust. I was satisfied with the effort he made to win her back. This is not a cheating book but a family that did not approve of his love for her. so they got rid of her. A deathbed confession and I was hooked. I was just going to read a chapter and go to sleep but finished the book."
3,"Luc believed some photos that showed his mistress in a very compromising position with his own brother.  He then got rid of her believing family over her.  Six years later he discovers that his brother lied and that his own father put him up to it.  He then throws himself full throttle in to getting Skye back.  Believing her in all things and questioning his own father.  Very nice story about forgiveness and getting past preconceived notions of another.  The characters were well drawn but I suppose there was a question to get past though.  If Luc believed that his own brother would betray him like that why did he continue to get along with him?  Why did he continue to have a relationship with him but toss Skye out to the street?  The only thing that makes since is that Roberto was his brother and he could forgive him but not Skye.  Yet one would think that is a line that a BROTHER should never cross!! (therefore the reason for 4 stars)"
3,"I want to start by saying this is a great cover. Sexy man in heart underwear clearly highlighting his 'attributes' I mean what's not to like right. So without even cracking the cover it's off to a very promising start. The story is well paced. engaging and carries you seamlessly to the very last page. The relationship and interaction between the main charcters is natural. realistic and gets nice and steamy without dragging on too long in any one spot. I do wonder if anything will come of Suzanne and Stan seeing as there was mention of them meeting to discuss business and it stood out to me that maybe there could be more there?? Another book perhaps ;) In the end Lacy's adventurous side will balance out Gabe's more reserved side and they'll find their HEA. This was my first time reading Tori Scott and I'm definitly looking forward to reading her other books. cuz if there anything like this one I won't be disappointed!"
3,"I am a huge Debbie Macomber fan. there's not too many books of hers that I haven't read.  After saying that. her best writing. in my opinion is her Cedar Cove series.  With 12 books total. the books follow a cast of characters through life and hardships.  The series starts with 16 Lighthouse road and ends with 1225 Christmas Tree Lane.  It's easy to know where you are in the series based on the title - the first number in the title is the corresponding number in the series.  Debbie Macomber's characters draw you in and make you feel as though you are part of the plot and by the time you have finished the book(s) you feel as though some of the characters are you best friends as with Olivia and Grace.  You meet them in 16 Lighthouse Rd and 204 Rosewood.  If you download this book/series. you won't be sorry.  Curl up in your favorite reading chair and be transported to Cedar Cove.  Enjoy!"
3,"The Cedar Cove Series is written so anyone any age can enjoy the story.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest I could relate to many of the area references.  The story held my interest because there are so many stories going on at the same time.  Unfortunately the TV rendition changed a few of the events and personalities of the characters and that to me detracted from the book rendition.  I read all 6 books and enjoyed picking up the story each and every time I left off and resumed the books.  Good writing and story telling."
3,"Another great book in the cedar cove series. I know some were not as happy with this book as the others in the series. but I liked it. I like the new romance of Teri and chess player. Bobby.  It's a new twist for d. Macomber. Usually her characters are not celebs. And also chess is a different world entirely.  It's a great incorporation. I like catching up with past characters. I've come to love and the settling of story lines. It's a wonderful read. I can't wait to start 74. I hope you hop on board and enjoy a slice of happiness and dizziness."
3,"Boatman's got style and vision. The vast majority of the stories in GOD LAUGHS WHEN YOU DIE are wildly inventive and unpredictable. cleanly written and forceful. Some of them will make you a little... uncomfortable. While the subject matter is deadly serious. there's a strange undercurrent of bleak. bleak humor here as well. the kind of humor you cling to when faced with ugly truths that can't be denied.The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review was the somewhat messed-up formatting. But despite that. I'm looking forward to more from this author."
3,"I wasn't certain whether 4 or 5 stars were warranted for this book.  It's very well written. but the subject matter makes for a very emotional. hard read.  As a cat lover. I hated the premise of this book.  But. it's a subject that needs more exposure; torture in the name of research.  Just don't leave this book lying around for a child to get into; it's not a Disney- or Seuss-style read.  I read it several months ago. and it's still in my memory banks. occasionally assaulting me at unguarded moments."
3,"I have always had dogs and read dog books.  Recently got a kitten - turned big-boy cat and thought I might enjoy this book.  It was extremely difficult to read.  Almost caused me to have a panic attack.  If these things really go on out there - I guess I have been living under a rock.  A colleague was going to get it for his 9 year old daughter and I said NO  Not a book for kids to read.  I am hugging my big boy cat as I write this.  I will be on the lookout for any other Sisypuss vagabond cats out there from now on.AS BOB BARKER WOULD SAY:  SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PET (and anyone else's you can afford to)."
3,"This was the first effort by Mr. Skinner. It's a very simple. lovingly. sweet story about 2 lost souls that find each other. Their union brings a stability and happiness that each have lost. Brock's life is rocked by scandal and Carey's life is rocked by loss. Carey extends a hand of friendship to a disillusioned Brock.Having read &#34;Memorizing You&#34;. Mr. Skinner's second effort. I can see great leaps in his story telling.but don't let that deter you from reading this. It's just what you need for a summer read."
3,"Having read 'Memorizing You' by this author and thinking that it was one of the best books I had ever read. I was anxious to read his first book. 'CoverBoy.' This is a very sweet story of Brock. a man who has had everything and lost it. and Carey. a man who has sustained a loss. Both of these men find comfort with each other. and unlike other reviewers. I found this refreshingly sweet and very believable. I liked the line in the book.'There was no debate that the two of them needed each other. two displaced souls. to simply feel as if they had a place in a heartless world that appeared to have cast them off and forgotten them.'A good book and one that I'd recommend."
3,"Reviewed by Donna at [...]Jessie has been hurt so many times that she has absolutely no expectations when it comes to men.  She knows that all men will eventually hurt her. so she protects herself the only way she knows how.Wade is in love with Jessie. and he can't see himself ever being happy without having her as his wife.  When fate drops a whammy of a surprise in the middle of his seduction. can he adapt and overcome the obstacles that the past and present have thrown in his way?Mackenzie McKade writes seductive stories that are wicked and sexy and funny with hunky studs. wanton heroines. titillating plots and realistic settings.  Of course. the sex scenes are bone melting and the ending is a happily-ever-after.  I would love to read about Clancy's happily-ever-after. too!"
3,"Between political struggles and his being a vegetarian. I was looking for a bit more on the spiritual side. After all. he was called Mahatma. Which means great soul. (This review has to be short.)Gandhi was confronted by Christians who wanted to sell him their twisted idea of Christianity. Actually he was greatly moved by Tolstoy's work; Tolstoy hated how Christians distort the teachings of Jesus. and are so anxious to wage war. Jesus taught 'love thy neighbor' and &#34;turn the other cheek&#34;.He struggled with diet. he refused to eat meat. eggs. and refused even milk. In the end he tried to subsist on fruit juices. Gandhi believed that abstinence was important in realizing God. yet he was disgusted by his own lust and how he treated his wife."
3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
3,"This book was a recent Kindle Daily Deal and I decided to take a flyer on it. While I like anthologies. ones as topical as this one aren't what I usually read. So I had my doubts about how I'd like it.But the gamble paid off well; I thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole. The stories range from touching to humorous. While I'm usually not a fan of 'country humor' (who can compare to Twain?). the humorous stories in this book weren't bad. The non-humorous ones were pretty good.Even though I wasn't raised in the South. all of my extended family was and many of these stories reminded me of my childhood when I used to spend time there."
3,"These are very nicely written with lots of great vocabulary which I love especially since I have the click link for full definition!  The mysteries are not written from the point of view of the doctor. so you get to wait until the testimony to see if your accused will be found guilty! Some follow the &#34;Watson&#34; style character. some follow the innocent person caught in a horrible web of guilt. and some even follow the perpetrator! They are quite wonderful. Slight warning for you to be aware that in those times often the 'gentlemen' and 'ladies' (whites) are considered less &#34;suspicious&#34; than the &#34;foreign&#34; characters. But if you only read books with modern mores you will miss much."
3,"Dr. Thorndyke delves into early forensic science or in the language of his age. medical jurisprudence. He is a mixture of Sherlock Holmes and Gideon Oliver. The books include two novels and two books of short stories. They are all well written and fun to read although I chose 4 stars because they also tend to be repetitive. Thorndyke is always reviewing all the facts of the case meaning we get to read the same information at least twice. I enjoyed the volume though and would recommend it for light easy reading ~ especially if you are at all interested in bodies and bones."
3,"I gave the Craig Kennedy collection four stars. catering to those who like forensic investigations when the science was in its infancy. Actually. I liked the Thorndyke stories better. His cases are more believable. better written. and the characters are developed better. I read all of the books in this volume and enjoyed my time. Still. the procedures are a bit tedious since as a rule they are pretty familiar to most readers. Forensic science has progressed so much more. but if you like this period of history. you will enjoy Thorndyke. --Dr. William H. Stephens. retired editor"
3,"I just love these old mysteries and Freeman's are not as slow moving nor as  lugubrious and verbose as others. For myself. I find they are an easy read; that is. beautifully written. engaging and enjoyable.I especially liked the short stories and Helen Vardon and did not find the typos to be onerous. not finding above half a dozen in the last full-length novel. I am definitely going to be acquiring more of this author's work.  Thank you Amazon for making these pieces available and at such reasonable prices. In fact. many are free!!"
3,"This is quite a bit different from Volume 1.  The first few stories were written from the perspective of the criminal committing the crime which was somewhat different.  But enter Dr. Thorndyke and justice is served.  The author is somewhat of a loquacios writer in that 10 or 20 words are used when 1 or none would do.  But he really does set the scene.  The authors of mysteries always need to create the  crimes and clues to match the expertise of esoteric knowledge of the protagonist but some of the these stories are over the top. However they are still very interesting and impart facts that I wasn't aware of.  They are extremely fun and interesting reads and I will continue to search for more like them."
3,"As with any &#34;frontier&#34; the American west had its share of opportunists. dreamers. hard working folks. bigger than life characters. and dangerous misfits.  The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid.  Pat Garrett's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was.  For anybody with an interest in America's frontier days this is a great read."
3,"I found Vol 1 to be well written blending both the old and the new.  It was true to a singular focus and the characters were unique.  I enjoyed the banter between Maggie and Link and it reminded me of the 'Moonlighting' TV series of years past with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd.  I admit I wanted to strangle Maggie many times but that was part of her charm (I guess).I don't have any idea of the authenticity of La Malinche or Montezuma's Treasure itself and that is not important.  The author made it all believable to me in a fictional way.  I give Vol 1 5 stars and commend the author for a job well done."
3,"Griffin is a man on flight. His family wants him dead and he has no one and no where to go. He is young and smart but in an post apocaliptic world he is alone. And one night. in an alley. he is shot dead. Or he thinks so. But then Jarrah arrives to help him.Jarrah is a vampire. A former doctor he cherishes the human life above all. And he hates himself to be a vampire. And like Griffin. he is alone.Griffin is immediately drawn by the vampire. better by the man. although it is the first time he feels sexual desire for a man. But it is not a gay thing. it is the need of a lonely soul to share its feeling. And doesn't matter if this soul is of a man. Love is above the gender.A very beautiful novel. very intimate and close: for the most part shared between the two characters. it has also very well written sex scenes."
3,"This book didn't really go the way I thought it would.  For one. I expected more action overall with the fact that Griffin is being hunted and I also didn't expect him to find out about Jarrah so quickly.  The dystopian society was a nice touch but I would have liked some more detail about it to make the backbone of the story a little stronger.  Overall I liked the story but. honestly. I think it would've been better if there had been more conflict; really the entire thing was just too EASY and that's a shame because I could see the potential for a more in depth story."
3,"Alma Owens narrates a very interesting picture of life in the days without running water. indoor plumbing and having baby after baby and loving each and every one of them (the children. not the hardships).  Its written in a way that if you close your eyes and listen to her words you feel as though she is speaking just to you. regarding her life when times were very very hard. Not driving she had a very limited means of getting around places until she was older and then she learned to drive.  Her husband was not encouraging in her getting out and about on her own. and in some way. not real supportive. but that was the way men were in those days.  I loved this book and highly recommend it to anyone wanting an very interesting peek into America's history."
3,"This love story is delightful.  Ryan and Mariah . a workaholic father and a genius child.  are living a life devoid of real happiness.  Ryan wants to secure Mariah' s future. by making a fortune and having Mariah' s intellect developed.  Being at work and not spending time with Mariah. causes her to look for a mother.  Chance brings Kelsey into the father and daughter's lives.  Bringing these three people together makes their story an enjoyable and interesting  read.  The author.  makes each character  realistic. This was quick read because I could not put the book down.  I hope everyone will enjoy this much as I did.  True romance will always win with me."
3,"If you would like to save your money you can simply go to the authors website and subscribe to some kindle blogs as there is nothing and I mean nothing that cannot be found easily by taking the review list on this page (list of &#34;whats inside&#34;) and cut and past into google with the added words ON KINDLE. Youre now done. While the author clearly means well. this how to is a big let down. Full of links to elsewhere instead of explaining within its contents. Very very very very short book. I hate to give negative reviews but this should have been so much better. I feel kind of ripped off even for paying such a small amount of money. The author is talented enough to do a real job and live up to what we as Kindle people need and expect."
3,"I love how Dave Emberson breaks down Kindle procedures into clear steps. just like making an omelet. Do this. then do that.  If you follow his steps. you'll serve up a tasty banquet of new ways to enjoy your new Kindle. It's well worth the price. and his is a guide which I still consult often.  Dave is also updating his book frequently. which is an additional benefit of buying it. as well as a great example of the benefits of Kindle reading versus print.I interviewed Dave by telephone for the October 31. 2008 episode of my weekly audio podcast. The Kindle Chronicles. If you'd like to hear how he came to write the book and his thoughtful perspectives on the Kindle. here is the link: [...]"
3,"GREAT ADDITION TO THE LEARNING CURVE OF THE KINDLE.  Just finished reading the third edition of this book. I was surprised about the little tidbits that I didn't know about!!! My Kindle is used only for downloading books via either my computer or Whispernet from Amazon and of course reading them. I am not interested in using the Kindle for anything else so a lot of the book does not apply to my uses. But those that do are worth the small amount charged for this book. It is a bargain. Even my dogs are happy that I have converted over to the  Kindle since the pathways they use were growing smaller with each new book brought home."
3,"I wrote a 'downer' of a review yesterday...then realized that I hadn't read the entire book! Silly me...This is a very good 'cookbook' with clear directions and quite a bit of good help that isn't in the basic Kindle User's Guide. I know I'll have more fun with this new best friend of mine after I finish the cookbook and start trying all the things listed that one can do. Just the thought of being able to access my Gmail while going down the road in our RV makes my mouth water. Add to that the ease of reading with larger type...well. this Western Reader is one happy gal. Thanks. David. for all your hard work!"
3,"Mother and daughter and daughter's younger friend. Apart from being well --- if a little old fashioned ---written this book is one remarkable journey that every woman MUST read and every man must experience. It's a grand romp in the best tradition and nary a deviation into the horrors of modern day handcuffs and whippings and similar. It stays sexy and it stays erotically on track. It takes place at the farm where the servants are sent out of vision and earshot and the main players ....play! Sex in the best tradition. Read it and if you don't get a serious twitch every time you do...I feel sorry for you."
3,"I had the feeling based on the title that this was not going to be a piece of fine literature. but ...well...it still disappointed me.it has potential.  there is an intriguing back story of the 'hero' belonging to a group of powerful spies known as the Archangels. but that aspect is barely even fleshed out.Speaking of flesh....That's basically all this book is.  There are much better offerings.  I equate this to a Cinemax after dark video when it so easily could've been so much more."
3,"The storyline was very unique.  I am not going into the plot. because others have described it.  What I DIDN'T LIKE. was our H was nothing but a bully and was very demeaning in the first half of the book towards our h.  What I LIKED about the story. was the sex.  it was raw. very imaginative. and hot.  There was somewhat of a  story. in between the sex.  I didn't feel a connection to any of the secondary character's to read the rest of the series.  The next book is only 96 pages and is $2.99. at least this one was free. (ljb)"
3,"In these stories everybody smokes.  The courtesy of offering a pack of cigarettes is common. The characters are classic 50s people. as are the social proprieties. The illustrations are highly representative of the 50s science/fiction dime novel. and the magazines of that time. Although he was not the first to deal with the principle of multiple time lines. I think he was the first to base a series of stories on the concept. These have not aged well. but the science behind these stories are still valid. I will have to admit I read these stories after Fuzzy Sapiens. his masterpiece. and one of the top books of all time. certainly in this genre. We lost a great storyteller prematurely when he left us."
3,"I wasn't familiar with Piper until I happened across this 99 cent kindle compilation of five short stories (although I had read the first story 'Genesis' at some point in the distant past).  These are great examples of true classic sci fi stories. originally published in '50s pulp magazines.By and large. the stories hold up well but there are a few 'future' technology details that seem dated.  And like much pulp sci fi from the fifties you can see the unfortunate influence of McCarthyism; but. as with much older fiction if you can get past that and accept it as a reality of the time it was written. the story is very enjoyable.This inexpensive kindle editon is very well formated.  This little book serves as a great introduction to Piper or just as a quick read when you are in the mood for classic pulp stories."
3,"H Beam Piper will stand as one of the greats of sci-fi/fantasy for as long as the printed word exists. whether you are a mystery/thriller. detective novel or space opera/alternative universe fan. Piper delivers. In H B's writing you will find the forerunner of many who followed in his ginormous footsteps. (federated terran space. space vikings. even his place names have been copied by later writers! Aldebaran sound familiar)? Great reading. great fun and a must for anyone who really wants to be lost in another space/time continuum!"
3,"I have read the first two stories in this book and will not continue with it.  It does not read at all like science fiction. rather it reads like every day life in the 1950s with scholars studying Martians rather than Egyptians.  Really boring.Little Fuzzy looks to be a 'paid by the word' novella.  It could have been written in about one quarter of the words and space used.  The story is cute and well meaning in that what do we consider sapient.  I have learned that this is an author I will steer clear of.  It seems they sure did a lot of smoking and drinking in those days.  I find that this type of busy writing is just not my cup of tea. if you will."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
3,"I was eager to read this novel and downloaded it at the time it was 0.99. Big spender I know but I am glad I did not spend more. I was intrigued by the concept and some of the scenes of college life are both surreal and funny. Though that is all the positives I have for this meandering book. I mean there is no Jekyll Hide scenario. no ON/OFF if you will. Its like the whole book is more off than on. there is one speed and it is slow. Jamie Pepper undergoes an experiment to battle a disease of the brain. At first it seems effective. but is it really? Are these strange dreams he is having or is he doing things he is unaware of? None of it seems believable enough to me to warrant the climax. I will say that the life in the dorm aspect is entertaining and funny. but the novel as a whole was a big disappointment to me."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
3,"Such a shame that leaders controlling people elders etc are still wounding the body.Numbers of Christians that leave churches because they haven't. Found a way to cope with the pain of betrayal by those who are suppose to love them.Trusting in the power of God to change the situation until you know it's time to change churches take courage.This book maybe the answer to staying open to Gods purpose for you helping you work through the feelings and anger(at times) don't leave God don't stop loving God just because the waters are muddy in the church."
3,"What a dead end book! I not only struggled to read it as it was so boring yet forced myself to finish it to get the most ridiculous ending possible. It may be free but don&#8217;t waste your time as you&#8217;ll never get that back I sure wont. To make it worse the female lead was a split personality that went from a battered. scared introverted woman who was petrified of her husband to an independent. confident woman who could take on the world from the smile of a complete stranger she immediately fell in love with. The silliest book & biggest waste of my time & don&#8217;t expect much Native American storyline added in. the name and cover were about as good as it got"
3,"I love romances that are 'real' and this one is so very real. The characters are not larger than life. they have pasts. things they regret and dreams they have forgotten. They are real everyday people with everyday problems.When they find each other. their feelings re-awaken who they used to be and help them stand up and be that person.I loved this book. it was beautiful. sweet. sad in places and oh ever touching. watching the changes that true love brings to their outlook on life."
3,"This book was just okay. The story line was predictable and unmemorable. I couldn't even remember what the storyline was when I would pick it up in the evenings to read another chapter. I don't know about the print version of the book. but in the kindle version. there are many misspelled words which for a &#34;wordy&#34; like me. makes the book seem less than legitimate. I gave it 3 stars because it was better than some novels as far as content but is a far cry from being on anyone's best sellers list."
3,"I wish I could give half stars. If so. I would give this 3 1/2 stars. but I can't so I will be nice and give it 4. It's not a bad book for the price (I got mine for $0.99). I will say that the editing was simply atrocious. but if you can get around that. it is a quick read. The characters are likeable and the story moves along pretty quickly. However. there were a few parts that I felt were too contrived and not overly believable to actually happen in real life. BUT. the love scenes were HOT and steamy. very well done. I finished this in a day. so go ahead and read this if you are a fan of the author (which I am) and are interested in escaping reality for a few hours."
3,"I was pleasantly surprised by the real-world perspective McCray brought to this story. The female lead demonstrates growth without being whiny and the male lead is developed with an interesting Native American flavor. Indian Moon will satisfy readers that enjoy romance but it also appears to other readers that crave more than just a love story. I found the theme of commercial development vs. environmental preservation interesting as well and that added yet another layer of interest for me as someone that does not typically read romance novels.And any book with both a Rob Zombie AND a Motley Crue reference in it are cool with me ;)This a great beach read. You won't be disappointed."
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
3,"These two have a relationship gone bad and he doesn't know why. She pushed him away because of her fears but he is determined to not let that come between them.  He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one. but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."
3,"This is the story of Devin. a skittish diva who is running from love and Erik. the man hell bent on chasing her crazy behind until she admits she loves him and is ready to move their relationship to the next level. I LOVED this short story to pieces!!!Erik is in love with Devin and has asked her to move in with him. Devin. afraid of living the hellish life her parents lived. is gun shy when it comes to commitment and decides moving in with Erik is going too far too fast so she dumps him.The chase and capture is funny as all get out! Devin finally relents under what I can only describe as the sexiest. most sensually erotic siege it has ever been my honor to behold. I wish I could give this more stars.Well done!**BEST READ: with a glass of Blackberry Merlot and chocolate dipped strawberries! Have your little black book handy. you might need to call in reinforcements LOL!!!"
3,"I loved this shorter story about Zadist. Bella and Nalla. I had no idea that they were having troubles in their marriage. I couldn't believe that things almost didn't work out for them. My heart was breaking for Bella and Nalla. and Zadist too because of everything that he was going thru. It's like a normal every day marriage - there was lack of communication and I was so happy that during the read they were able to figure out what they needed to figure out. talk about what they needed to talk about. and work it out. Oh I just love the whole series and can't wait for March 2013. Once again J R Ward outdid herself with this short story about the now happy lil perfect family!"
3,"While I wholeheartedly agree that the lenghth of the book is disceptive that should not detract from an excellent story.  Give the publisher hell they deserve it.  Back to the story. it was great.  The author explores the fact tha HEA does not come without set backs and challenges.  The love of Z and Bella proves worthy of these challenges.  The story of the plastic surgeon and his wife was beautiful.  They are characters worthy of the series.  Inspite of its length the story rates a great read."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"Zsadist is one of my favorite brothers----oh. who am I kidding. they are all my favorite because JR Ward is the BEST---so I was really excited to see that we get a continuation of his story in this novella.I was disappointed to see that it was only 96 pages. but as usual. JR Ward made every word count and it was an emotional. heartfelt 96 pages.  I think I teared up three times. and my husband kept asking me what was wrong.I'm no fan of short stories or novellas but I loved Father Mine.  I think it is the best novella I've ever read.Just One Gripe:It was just too short!The Best Thing About This Book:I liked seeing someone working through their problems in therapy.  I liked that the problems weren't magically solved by love."
3,"Zsadist is my favorite brother.  He won my heart in book 2 'Lover Eternal'.  He can be stubborn but so why so many threats. Bella?I am disappointed with Bella.  She has her fears and they are true concerns. but she knew Z was not much of a talker when she mated him.  Instead of talking to each other. they let their thoughts build up and neither one of them can read minds.  So Bella is left with threats and ultimatums.  And that just broke my heart.  All ends well but it was 'much to do about nothing' if they only talked to each other.Any Z & Bella fan. this is a must read!"
3,"This is a sweet book about Zhadist and what he does to put his past behind him so that he can have the future he truly wants with his mate and child.And what a mate he has.  She is perfect for him.  Understanding and loving and willing to do whatever is necessary to protect her child and assure the future she deserves.  She is strong and determined and yet loving and accepting for Zhadist as he is as well as the horrible past that has molded him into the person he is now.And what love Zhadist has for Bella.  He is willing to do whatever must be done to exorcise his demons so he can give her and his child the life they deserve.  A truly touching story of love.This story is a must read for any BDB fans."
3,"As usual J.R.Ward doesn't disappoint with this Novella of Zsadist and Bella!! The only thing that upset me was that I wished it was as long as her other Black Dagger Brotherhood books but I realize this was a Novella so I get it! I have already recommended this series to many of my friends and they love them as much as I do!!! I can't wait for the next book of this series that comes out in April...Thank you J.R. Ward for making me so happy just by reading your amazing books...You're a true talent!!!"
3,"I was looking for a book to download to my Kindle when I ran across this extra story on my favorite characters from this author - Zsadist and Bella. All I can say is that I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by just how much plot and dialogue we got in this continuation of one of my favorite couples.The story covers the difficulties for Zsadist and Bella when they had their first child. I really like how it explores just the pocket of time when fatherhood was pretty new for Zsadist - and how the couple worked through it. It really just gives us 15 minutes more with our favorite JR Ward characters!So if their story was your favorite book in the series. then I recommend that you read this story. You will enjoy it."
3,"Father Mine is a short story that is a continuation of Zsadist and Bella's story. It picks up sometime after Lover Enshrined. but going on at the same time as well.This story starts after Nalla is born. about three months after. in fact. Zsadist is still having a hard time dealing with his past as a blood slave. and it's taking a toll on his mating. and with his relationship with his daughter.This is a sweet. romantic story that I was hoping for. having finished Lover Awakened and almost feeling cheated by the ending. This book gives Bella and Z their HEA. and it really makes me love Z more. Great short story. and a must-read for any BDB fans. :)"
3,"This novella was super cute. Zsadist and Bella are one of my favorite couples in this series and ever since we saw she got pregnant. and how dangerous these moments are for vampires. things changed a little in their relationship. We can see Zsadist more concerned with Bella but talking less about their life. Nalla was born in the end of the previous book and everything looked perfect. but reading this story is clear to me that Zsadist needed more time to understand the new reality and his fears are still very close to the surface. so it took him some difficult moments.I loved this new glimpse in their life together. I think we could have more insights like this for the other couples. since we lose touch with them as this series grow."
3,"I downloaded this book right after I read Zsadist's story in the series.Needless to say. I loved this book.  While I didn't like the beginning because of the turmoil that was going on with Zsadist and his unacceptance of his daughter.I sped through the book because I needed to know that he overcame his obstacles and as usual the book did not disappoint.I was happy for Zsadist when he finally worked through his issues and was delighted to see the family dynamic between him. his wife and his daughter.Great read.  I would love to read about Rhage and Mary as the author hinted in this book that Mary wanted to have a child.  Also. and update on the King and Queen would be nice."
3,"I read and enjoyed the prequel to this book. Lover Awakened. so I thought I would try this shorter e-pub. It was good!As a new father. Z must come to terms with his past so he can embrace fatherhood. and baby Nella. without fear. Tender scenes with Z. Bella. and Nella. Sizzling sex. too.SPOILER -----I was expecting the visit to the dermatologist / plastic surgeon to end differently. Usually. in most romances. everything gets tied up in a pretty bow. but that gets old. This seemed more authentic."
3,"I usually enjoy books by Ms. James. but this book I found to be boring.  My attention kept drifting elsewhere.  I thought perhaps if I closed the book. and returned to it later. that this would solve the problem.  Nope...it wasn't that I wasn't focused...the story was just boring.  Even the sex scenes were blah...I skimmed them!!! I also don't understand why this is labeled as an anthology...there's only one story in the book. unless the excerpts of other works are included under the definition of an anthology.  The story ended at 88% of the kindle content."
3,"I loved that Megan's got a mate...it was a needed end to a series. The angst of her journey was well written if a little more intense than I liked. I would've let Lex beat the snot out of him! Because  Shane was not any kind of alpha hero but a selfish self-centered snotty momma's boy. Lauren did not ease me into liking him...he was spoiled and shallow from the beginning as a written character and she never corrected that impression thru his words and deeds ...so the end came and I didn't believe in the change of heart. Megan ...and the series as a body of work... is the only reason this one gets even 3 stars. Warning: the hero is a good looking wuss!"
3,"I'm not sure why some of the reviewers were so hard on this book- I wasn't expecting a great work of fiction- and it's eroticia- so my expectations weren't great.  However- this book is well written and the characters are well developed.  Unlike most eroticia- where the characters are faced with a serial killer. a stalking ex. or a bank robber (none of which ever seem all that real to me). the big issue this couples faces is realistic and typical.  Does that make for an exciting escape for the readers?  Probably not- but it felt real to me.  This was the first f/m/f book I've ever read.  I was leary of it. but it was done tastefully. I would gladly read this author again."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
3,"What do you get when you mix sci-fi and romance? Well if you're Cathryn Cade you get a compelling mix of the best of both genre's.In Tyger. Tyger Burning Bright we are introduced to the crew of the The Orion. the space ship version of a cruise ship. We meet some of the crew but this novel centers around the ships navigation officer Tyron Jag who goes through the mating shift while trying to navigate the new ship through an area of space that needs his expertise. We also meet Calla Fellura a novice crew member and the ships interpreter.The heat between Ty and Calla is intense. this is a total panty wringer. it is also amazingly well written with characters that are funny as well as sexy and with a plot that keeps you turning the pages and reaching for the next book. The world that has been created and the species that are developed are both fun and imaginative.While each novel is self contained it is best read in order so the sub plots in the novels are more understood."
3,"What an amazing disappointment this short story was.  (And believe me..it's short.)I was hoping for what the product description promised:'a story full of passion. intrigue. humor and good old-fashioned romance'What I got was poorly written smut. cheesy sex scenes and zero plot.  The characters were flat. lifeless and completely drab.  This belongs on an erotica forum site for people to post their sexual fantasies.  It is not even remotely close to being worthy of being called a book. short story. or even ebook!My only consolation comes from the fact that I downloaded this while it was free on Amazon and did not waste my money on this badly written smut fest.Do not waste your time or your money.You will regret it."
3,"This is a fun read. like a fantastically cheesy Sci-Fi channel movie. but with a lot more sex.Basically. you've got a ship imperiled by the dual threat of an eco-terrorist on board and the main navigator being rendered useless by his &#34;tyger mating shift.&#34;  Apparently these things are controlled by the moon yet also somewhat unpredictable and now he's got to have a tyger female to mate with.  Oh. there's a cute young female tyger on board?  Well. awesome.They frolic in the garden.  That's the only reason to read the book (the plot is very basic) and the author delivers.  If you like lite-shifter alpha male scenes with a less experienced female. I recommend.  I don't recommend this for anyone who might be downloading this for the sci-fi (the sci-fi is simply the setting. the sex is why the story exists).  It's a really fun read. but not much more."
3,"So amid all of the intentional spelling (tiger = tyger/tygre. bright= bryght) and tiger references (tyger-honey or tyger-pussy or tyger-mate.....we get it! they are 'tygers') there was a solid story here that was very sexy. However it got a bit repetitive. It was also a bit short (but thanks to the other review I was sort of expecting it. thanks!) The only things that bothered me aside from the spelling and repetition was that it was short. I mean. not physcially short...but if you ignore all the repetitiveness there isnt very much there. So. 3 stars."
3,"I read this entire series and really enjoyed them. This last book was better than I thought. based on the reviews I read. Wasn't really necessary to go along with the rest of the series. but I enjoyed it and usually. I like to read all the books in a grouping. I read books so fast that sometimes by the time I write a review I need to go back and jog my memory. This is definitely worth the read and especially if you have read the rest. I cant say its the best of the bunch. but try it."
3,"The first thing that stuck out for me in The Unmasking of Lady Loveless was the great characters. The author did a wonderful job in such a short piece of writing and I felt her talent really shone through for the genre.With an orginal storyline and interesting twists along the way. this historcial reeled me in and kept me enchanted right to the end.For those who rag on the length. you do realize this is a short? That's the whole point of The Undone Line. If you somehow feel ripped off. I suggest making yourself aware of that before buying."
3,"This is a very short novella . Lord Alexander Beaumont goes into Whites and notices everyone is treating him oddly.He finds out his estranged wife has written an erotic book.It is written under the name of Lady Loveless and  has set the ton on edge. The book is all about their sexual escapades. They are saying it is Lady Milecent since her madiden name is used to send it to be published. He decides to go and seduce his shy and cold wife he hasn't seen her in two years.He plans on using scences from her books. She is living with her alcoholic brother and hypochondric mother.I won't give you any more details of the story you will have to read it to find out if they can get together after this time. It is short but a nice  read."
3,"I admit. being a Harlequin Mini. I didn't expect much. but this was so much fun to read!  It starts out with Lord Alexander Beaumont learning that his wife (who he hasn't seen in years) writes erotica novels under the identity 'Lady Loveless'.  Because of this. he decides to pay her a visit.His wife. Melicent. is taking care of her ailing mother and is shocked when her husband arrives out of the blue.  I can't say anymore to the plot without giving it away. but it was a lot of fun and some unexpected surprises popped up which had me laughing.  I thought there was the perfect blend between plot. characterization. and sex.  And to add. the sex wasn't like most of the sex scenes you see in books.  The author used some great creativity in this area.Definitely worth the price and the 5 star rating!"
3,"This story is very short (think novella). but it it's very well-written and the plot moves at a nice. quick pace. This is a great. easy read for a few hours (especially for the beach or that plane trip).The story revolves around an estranged couple. a misunderstanding. and a cute and funny revelation at the end.I don't really understand the negative/mediocre reviews. because I personally loved this story.  I get that everyone has their own opinion. but if you're a fan of adult historical fiction. you will definitely enjoy this!"
3,"The book was OK. There was little development on the characters. It was like walking into a room where the movie is half over and only watching like 10 minutes. There really was no background except the constant reminder that she was abused. You don't even know what she does at work except sit at a desk. It could have been developed more. I enjoyed Make Mine Midnight better. At least those characters had some history and was slightly developed in the story on why they wanted a lifetime commitment. These guys just start right off wanting this lifetime commitment but you are not told what has inspired them to go after Christine."
3,"This story was more a rough draft than anything that should have been published. First thing. the two men. we know they're ex-Seals. but we have no idea what they REALLY do for a job in this book (security?). how they came there. and what POSSIBLE interest they have in Christina since she is skittish and phobic. Off the bat. theyre trying to get in Christina's pants for a life time relationship... are you kidding me? Serious? All of a sudden they're flying from an unknown location to Chicago in their personal jet with a king size bed? Kidnap her dog? Its frustrating... this book was scattered in thought. execution and information."
3,"This is a sequel to Two Sighted. I suggest you read that first to get full understanding of the story. Christina. TJ and Jon were featured in Two Sighted and this story picks up shortly afterward.Christina has been fighting her attraction to TJ and Jon for a long time. she doesnt' trust men and from their physical size. she's sure the can't trust them. In addition she can't decide which one she's attracted to if she can overcome her trust issues. She's heard rumors but they couldn't possibley be true. could they?TJ and Jon have been waiting for Christina to show some interest and finally they feel she's ready. They have been ready and now is the time! But Christina's family is once again coming between her and her future.I love Ann Jacobs sensual romances because they tell a story. you don't just get continous sex."
3,"This book confused me from the beginning all the way to the end. It starts without any pre story. You dont know anything about any of the characters. all you get is this woman who is scared of men. these two 'hot' guys that work with the girl a best friend who sets something!!! up. it doesnt really say until it gets hot and steamy. So its 0 to 10 in all of 3 seconds. This book lacked details that developed the characters and not knowing details made it seem very unbelivable."
3,"We know why we read these books. the not sex.  But I do want some feeling as to why these people are so in love.  For them it isn't just about the sex. it emotional.  But the problem with most short stories is that the reader is plopped down in the middle of these relationships and we have no time to feel what the characters are supposed to be feeling.Then there was the heroines family.  Not well done.  I think the author is capable of writing a good story but she make it impossible to believe the situations because it had to be rushed.  Not well done."
3,"I liked this one. It wasn't all about the sexy times together. It was really more of a story. which I enjoyed.Christina doesn't trust men. Her father is an abusive alcoholic and her brother turned out exactly the same. So. she left but it's left her scarred. She wished more than anything her mother would leave. and can't understand why she doesn't. You sort of knew what was going to happen but it was a bit more surprising than that.I liked it. It was sexy. sweet. and enjoyable."
3,"Can a woman from an abusive background find love and a lasting relationship. Apparently so. Can she find the love she needs in a menage a trois? Apparently so. Chris is able to overcome the trauma of being raised by an alcoholic abusive father and a mother who was completely submissive to him. Throw in a brother who has grown up to be just like the father and this poor girl has a lot to overcome. She did with the help of her lovers Jon and TJ. This is a short read can be done in one evening. While not out standing was entertaining. Chris is to be given a lot of credit for her strength in overcoming her horrible background."
3,"Right off the bat I have to say the character development is epic!  My emotions were all over the place with this one.  The main characters made me angry. sad. and frustrated but yet I want them to work and be happy!  Crazy huh?  Because Kalleysten has taken the time to develop these interesting characters. it was easy to purchase the next book in the series.  (I was given a copy of Blurred Nights in exchange for an honest review.) Although I have to admit I would like to see certain characters end up together. I can't wait to see how the rest of the story is written.  This was a great start to the series although I think a prologue about vampire/human pacts would have been helpful.  After you read this one be prepared to order the next!"
3,"This story was not like the other books I've read from Kallysten in the past. I found it difficult to engage in the story at the beginning. However. once I stuck it out past the first 5 or 6 chapters. I was pleasantly surprised. I found that instead of the instant sex appeal and gripping tensions with characters that immediately immersed me in the past. it was a story that read like a slow burn. gradually building up layers of complexity. and personality in all the players involved. By the time I was half way through the book. Kate's issues were personal to me. and I was rooting for them to find a way to make it work. I actually cried towards the end of this book. and that's an incredibly rare thing for me as a reader. So although it took me longer to get into the characters and their story. it was well worth it to keep it up. and see it through to the end."
3,"In world that is invaded by demon like creatures. humans and vampires are fighting back using a variety of methods that they can use but in the end...This story goes deeper than that. it is about acceptance and forgiveness as well determination to know what you want and going for it. It is for believing things that you may not want to see...The book was captivating like many of Kallysten's books are but the descriptive about the different elements were fascinating and it was an enjoyable book to read.  Overall I would rate this book a solid 4 stars.If you like paranormal elements as well as futuristic sci-fi books then this is one you may enjoy as well.I am looking forward to the next installment in the series.I received a copy of the book from the author. thank you."
3,"Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available."
3,"If I had to use just one word to describe this book it would be. Awesome! I absolutely loved it! I only put it done when necessary. and finished it in one day (which is hard to do when you have two daughters lol). I'm an action kind of girl and this book is full of it.Even though Marc hurt Blake in the past. Blake is still loyal and cares for his sire. though he still harbors some feelings of rejection and hurt. When they meet Kate they are quite surprised by her. Through a game of conquest to gain the affection of Kate. they not only both fall for her but they also settle some issue from the past. There is a little m/m sex and some erotic dreams. not much. but what is there is totally hot!"
3,"Complimentary Review Copy Provided by Author. Demons. Vampires and Humans at war. Check. Vampires on the side of humans. Check. Plenty of action. Check. Romance between vampire and human. Check. Hot sexy scenes. Check. Tension between Sire and Childe. Check. All the boxes keep getting checked but. seriously. this is one great story that keeps the reader on the edge with action and sexual tension from page one until the end and leaves me. for one. eager to read books two and three in this Blurred trilogy within the Demon Age series."
3,"In Blurred Nights Marc is Blake's sire to become a vampire. Blake is a unique vampire in the world where they join humans to fight the demons that come from the earth to kill humans and spread terror. The immature Blake finds fighting demons a game. although a deadly game. while Marc is committed to the ancient ideas that vampires were put on earth to protect and help humans.The conversations full of wit between the two vampires. the underlying love for each other that they will not express in words and the competition for the attentions of the beautiful human woman fighter. Kate makes this a great story. Blake keeps coming up with new ways to keep the story flowing and interesting along with the well written sex scenes as they keep hunting the demon's breech.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review; the opinions expressed are my honest opinions. If you like paranormal and vampires. this is a very good story that I highly recommend."
3,"3.5*This is a very good start to the serial series. Vampires and Mages help humans fight the Demons. Marc and Blake are vampires. Marc is Blake's sire. one night while fighting Demons they come across a small group of humans also fighting Demons. Among the group is Kate a well seasoned fighter and one of the groups leaders. Marc and Blake take the group back to there base camp where they end up not being allowed to leave until they prove they have not killed any humans. Through close quarters and fighting together Marc. Blake and Kate start to care for each other. I'm looking forward to reading the next story. There is a very nice excerpt at the end for the next release. It will suck you right in."
3,"I have read a few of Kallysten's books. and I have to say she never disappoints. Loved the storyline and the action in this book. Kallysten's words give you the feeling as if you are right there living the story. I found this future world very intriguing. where humans and vampires are fighting together against their enemy demons. Kate. a human fighter and strong woman finds herself attracted to Marc and Blake. her vampire allies. Even though she has this strong feeling for both men she tries her best not to come between them. Marc and Blake have their own special bond as Sire and Childe and I can't wait to see how all three character's relationship progresses. Kallysten is a great story teller and her descriptive details in all her stories are worth reading. She has become one of my favorite authors."
3,"Although this isn't the usual kind of read I expect when I think of Kallysten it's definitely got her touch.  I'm used to more erotic vs. sensual romance although this story lacks in the erotic it doesn't lack for emotion or conflict.Kate is an extremely strong female. Marc is a Vampire and Blake is his Childe.  The three make for amazing chemistry and witty banter.  From first meeting there is a spark and although Kate is put off by Blake's cocky attitude she's extremely intrigued by Marc and his relationship with Blake.  Kate has lived as a soldier for quite some time. she's bonded as a warrior with her fellow teammates. Marc and Blake bring the woman back out in her.  They all give one another a different perspective on why their fighting and exactly what their fighting for.I enjoyed this book and will definitely be finishing the trilogy. I can't wait to find out more about these characters."
3,"I bought a Kindle 1 from my friend. It allows me to enjoy books and preiodicals again with its large print and clear e-ink. It frees me from reading large print only on the computer.I subscribe to USA Today's e-Edition. It looks like the printed paper. I can save it as a pdf and enlarge the print. The problems are: there is more information in each daily than I can absorb. and I'm stuck in front of a computer.I prefer the Kindle edition  of USA Today. It is more concise. thankfully. It's easy to navigate through articles and sections. and so is a quicker read.It would be nice if the publisher allowed downloading editions I might have missed. Until then. I must keep the online e-Edition subscription for past issues.I am totally happy with USA Today's Kindle Edition. Thanks!Arthur."
3,"I've been reading USA Today for over 5 years. I love the content. the features. the pictures. It's my favorite newspaper.Trying out the Kindle version. you get the articles but sometimes they're not formatted correctly. I did notice some black and white photos. Even if they had the photos that accompany the article in black and white that would be good.I tried it for a week while on vacation. I was able to keep up to date with the news but after that week. I decided to cancel it. I can't see myself canceling my print edition to read it on  Kindle.Hopefully. they'll improve it in the future. But now. just try it out for free to see for yourself."
3,"The USA Today via the Kindle is well done. We normally subscribe to the USA Today and the Washington Post. Yes you lose the color graphics but that is not a detriment if you want to read the news while traveling without having to find the paper on sale. Navigation around among the sections and the articles is very easy and intuitive. My husband had never used my Kindle and I gave it to him to read the paper and he had no problem with it.  Don't compare the USA Today with other newspapers. for the USA Today gives you just the facts and you provide your own opinion as it should be. Reading a story in the USA Today is about  the size of the exact same story in the Post but the Post provides a lot of opinion which I don't need. I form my own opinion after reading the paper. The Editorial page along with the Letters to the Editor are on the Kindle along with the sports. life. and all the world news. Great paper!!"
3,"First of all let's look at what makes USA Today readable in its print version:It is concise.well written and tries to cover all the major international.national and domestic news stories in an easy to read. user friendly format. It may not offer the intellectual brooding of papers like the NY Times but it also does not trivialize news like the New York tabloids.The USA Today just gives us the basics.In this regard it is ideally suited for the Kindle since the paper's format makes it easy to catalog and present news in its simplest form.The only reasons it gets 4 stars:1. The price needs to be lower since it is not published on weekends.2. I still am reserving the 5th star for the day when technology can make Kindle incorporate graphics.comics.crossword puzzles etc;"
3,"I see that some people did not rate this high.  'BUT' I have read the whole series.  This series is about 6 women who met in college and became fast friends.  They have nothing in common.  You really need to read the entire series to find out why they were pulled to each other.  I have read the entire series 3 times.  I loved it.  There are 6 Vamps too.  They have all been friends for thousands of years.Each book bings in new characters and of course keeps the former characters too.These books are full of action. adventure. 'SEX' and strong women and men.'WARNING' These books are 'R' rated.  No 'holes' barred in this series.  LOL!!!!!!!LOVE MY VAMPS/SHIFTERS/STRONG WOMEN/AND BEASTS OF MEN.  LOL!!!"
3,"I though the book was really good I liked how they got together and didn't play games like most romance novels will sometimes do I hate that now the only thing that I feel should have been done to this book is the ending needs to be changed did she move in with him did they get married what happened and when her dad said he was going to clean house I think we should have known what ever came of that since it was dealing with what happend to Cyn's dress other than that I found the book to be really good I read it in 3.5 hours the sex between them will have you thinking you are there with them great hot love"
3,"Aside from some formatting errors and the need to place breaks where some scenes change this was the cleanest text I have come across recently in a WM/BW e-book romances. This author must have an editor and this reader appreciates that.Loved the story and the cute take on the Cinderella story.  The characters were fun. sexy and well developed. I disagree with those who disliked the ending.  You know where Cyn and Parker are going to end up and you know Dad what her Dad is going to do no need to spell it out. I am looking forward to reading more books from Lena Matthews"
4,"This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of 'A Christmas Carol.'Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade. a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.His visit by the spirits. the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him. leads to a very sentimental ending.It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past."
4,"The first time I saw &#34;An American Christmas Carol&#34; I immediately fell in love with it.  I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story. acting. directing. camera work. costumes. sets. locations. music. and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor. but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.CA Luster"
4,"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur 'The Fonz' Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts. he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it. as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection."
4,"When this first aired in 1979. I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS. I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD. this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago. and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away."
4,"How coincidental that this program. aired by ABC in 1979. is set in the USA during the Depression era and here we are 30 years later. in 2009. experiencing an economic malaise of our own!  I remember having seen this on TV but viewing it again now on DVD made me realize that I'd forgotten about how downright mean and cold-hearted Henry Winkler's character. Benedict Slade. really is!!!  Politically-correct viewing in the 21st Century has really insulated from harsh emotions such as those portrayed by Mr. Winkler.  The production has that 70's look to it but it is well done and the actors and actresses all bring an unpolished genuine-ness to their parts.  Being a fan of 'A Christmas Carol' by Charles Dickens. I am pleased to have this rendition alongside other classic versions as well as the 1984 IBM production."
4,"Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic. One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy. The general feel of this movie. though. is grey. That's the best way to describe it. But then. it was a bleak grey time in American history. with the Great Depression and all. When Dickens originally wrote the book. it was a grey time in England's history as well. so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story.A nice twist (sorry. Oliver!) to a true classic.By the way. for my money. the finest original version out there is the George C. Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim."
4,"This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character. although well known by most. is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale."
4,"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However. it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit. and partly to my own blame. I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in. but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called 'must have Christmas movies' then pass it up for another title."
4,"Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona. but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued. not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved. and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies."
4,"Nice drama- based on the original Christmas Carol movie.  This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America.  Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.  But most people can.t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has &#34;sold&#34;.  Soon &#34;ghosts&#34;- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past. present. and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his &#34;value system&#34; .  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.  Dramatic with poignant scenes.  Held my attention throughout!"
4,"&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;. At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all.but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better. that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge. even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
4,"When this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television. at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries. I was skeptical because I had been disappointed in the stories of Abraham and Jacob.This film. though. is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph.  It is truly astounding with a stellar cast!  Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance.  He tears the heart right out of you!  No less superb is Lesley Ann Warren as Potiphar's lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails.This film is incredible and not to be missed!  I always cry buckets of tears at the end!  A true masterpiece in every way!"
4,"I would have to say that this is one of the best 'made-for-TV' (on TNT) biblical films I've seen. The acting was phenominal. the scenery..EVERYTHING. This movie is dead-on when it comes to accuracy from the Bible. which is pretty rare..almost unheard of in this day in age. It's a refreshing movie that has an honest. uplifting theme that will inspire you and your family. It could have easily been released in the theaters and it probably could have been bigger in popularity with a wider-span of audience around the world. Even so. I'm just glad that I can now buy the DVD! :)"
4,"As the title says. unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him. which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife. Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through."
4,"I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean. what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!For fans of this movie. look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses. Abraham. David. Jacob. and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham."
4,"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet. sorry."
4,"This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph. the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.Joseph is the favored son of his father. a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery. he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor. and Joseph's steadfastness. he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him. seeking help. they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first. it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well."
4,"Though it's been a while. I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that 'disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent. even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex. challenging and convincing. it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection. Patheos(dot)com. 1996)"
4,"I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done. is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books. I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies. true to the Bible."
4,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but. if there weren't. the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that. even though this is a family story. there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting. really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing. you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
4,"If it weren't for the seduction scene with Potiphar's wife. this movie would have been excellent.  That scene was so sensual that it was borderline 'R' rated in our book.  I almost shut it off at that scene.  Before the actual Biblical account of Jospeh running off. leaving his garment behind him. there is a scene in which Potiphar's wife joins him in a bathing room and (while he is in a pool) clearly and very erotically reaches her hands under the water and strokes his private parts.  He doesn't flee that time!  This scene ruined the movie for us. and though we've enjoyed other movies from this series. we couldn't keep this movie because of that one scene.  Too bad!"
4,"As most movies. this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out. it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph. his family and those he met in Egypt.  A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences)."
4,"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well. even Potiphar's wife.As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but. have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby"
4,"The series are amazing! Thank God such biblical figures are protrayed with the  Lord God as foundation.I was expecting those usual blurry versions. but this is entirely different. Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.  The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy. anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory.Watch it!"
4,"Of all the TNT movies. this one is actually the weakest. But it is still a good movie. The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau.The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel. The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about. but not focused on. The non-Scriptural parts. though. were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way. it was very good.If you choose to watch this movie. you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced. Just be sure you don't base much theology on it. ;-)The movie is a solid PG movie."
4,"I thought that this film was really good. i just wish they had made it sutible for children by cutting out a few things and putting some clothes on the egyptian women.  I really liked the  end. it was so good. best part  in the entire movie and worth buying just for that. This movie made the  story so real especialy when Joseph's brothers throught him in the pit. it  makes you realize just how hard it was for him. that his own family would  betray him.  And to the person that said that Joseph's brothers didn't like  him because he was a proud arrogant tattle tale that is so un-true.  His  brother's hated him because he obeyed their father and because Jacob loved  Joseph more than them.  Joseph was ALWAYS faithful and obeyed God. He was  sold into Egypt not because he needed to be straightened out. but because  God had a plan to save all the land from famine including Joseph's family."
4,"This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs. never the less. it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be. for the most part. some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film. with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram. the movie Joseph coming in a close second. and this movie. Moses. coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others. but the effort is exemplary."
4,"TNT has put together a surprisingly good account of the Biblical story of  Joseph. betrayed into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers.  Martin  Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate  performances. with the role of Joseph also well-acted.  Leslie-Anne Warren is  the lustful wife of Potiphar. who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph.  and lands him in the Pharoah's prison.  This film offers a very credible  depiction of life in the ancient Near East. from the desert tents of the  Hebrews. to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem. to the lushness of  civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court. The film is faithful to the  Biblical account. and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen.  A  well-acted. well-scripted. and entertaining film.  END"
4,"This four hour video looks a the familiar &quot;Joseph&quot; story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First. it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say &quot;brava&quot; to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally. the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However. my &quot;four star&quot; rating refers to the &quot;flashback&quot; section of the film.  Yes. why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the &quot;B&quot; grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden."
4,"'Joseph' masterfully brings the pages of Genesis alive with the same grit. power. and passion of the Biblical narrative. The acting is of the highest quality. being highlighted by Ben Kingsley's brilliant portrayal of Potiphar. Despite some Hollywood license. 'Joseph' remains true to the Biblical narrative. even including the sorted accounts involving Tamar and Dinah (which should mark the movie with a PG rating). It is an epic motion picture. lasting over 3 hours. but there is nothing I would have been left on the editing room floor. 'Joseph' does have its weaknesses. yet the movie receives my very highest recommendation. In fact. it is so good. I consider it one of my all-time cinematic favorites. It left me inspired. encouraged. and in awe of God's faithfulness. You will not be disappointed!"

4,"This delightful 1969 animation based on the popular song is a holiday treat that many of us grew up watching. and now we can share it with our children.  By today's standards. the animation is crude. but the story is heartwarming and the narration and singing by Jimmy Durante make it a priceless treasure.We are introduced to Frosty. a snowman made by some school children with a corncob pipe. two lumps of coal and a magician's hat that brings him to life.  When the temperature starts to rise. Frosty hitches a ride on a freight train bound for the North Pole.  However. the evil Professor Hinkle is hot on his trail to try to melt Frosty and get his hat back.  Finally. Santa Claus saves the day.My son is almost three years old and he loved this video.  No doubt your child will too."
4,"Frosty the Snowman is a true Christmas classic. While my favorite Christmas special remains Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.I have a special place in my heart for Frosty the Snowman and I watch it 2-3 times every December.including every Christmas Eve night. The beauty of Frosty the Snowman is that it's about imagination. How much fun is it to imagine building a snowman and having it come to life. And just around Christmas too! That's the real beauty of Frosty the Snowman. Another strong point of this show is Jimmy Durante's singing of the song Frosty the Snowman. I bought an mp3 version of Jimmy Durante's Frosty the Snowman from this show last November and it is definitely the best version of the song Frosty the Snowman that I've heard.  I highly recommend this show as it is a true Christmas classic."
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
4,"Christmas is a time of tradition. whether from food. family. or fellowship.  It is also the season when Hollywood tries to create their own traditions with the numerous 'holiday specials' that clog the airways throughout the month of December.  'Frosty the Snowman' is the cream of the crop.The story is simple: A magic hat brings 'Frosty' the snowman to life. after which he must travel to the North Pole to prevent being melted.  Meanwhile. an evil magician is trying to redeem the hat for his own nefarious purposes.Since 1951. children and adults alike have enjoyed this half-hour special.  Kids will be sucked in by the magic and music. while adults may just find even their eyes welling up a bit when Frosty is threatened near the end.Along with Claymation Rudolph. this TV special should be required watching around the holiday season."
4,"&quot;Frosty Returns&quot; is the epitome of why classics from the 60s and 70s need not be remade.  Although Jonathan Winters does a respectable job as narrator. the story suffers from &quot;politically correct&quot; environmentalism and de-Christianization of Christmas.  None of it was necessary and detracts the story.Furthermore. there is no artistic continuity with the original &quot;Frosty&quot;.  None of the characters are depicted in their original form and the computer-aided animation doesn't really add anything. either.I was disappointed that this episode was included with the Frosty DVD.  The true and worthy sequel to the original Frosty is &quot;Frosty's Winter Wonderland&quot;.  Watch that instead as it is MUCH better than this one."
4,"This is with out a doubt is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen!  My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it. but that's the only reason.  The movie is filled with overdone. unrealistic. trite political issues of the 90's.  It was too complicated for a small child to follow and there was barely even a plot.  Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues.  There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd.  The original Frosty is so wonderfully simple. buy that one instead."
4,"Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable. I cringed when I watched this with my son. I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic. rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes. This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless. Oops! I said Christmas. I meant Happy Holidays!"
4,"This is a fairly short Christmas special but it was made in the old days when a half hour on TV contained only four minutes of commercials. The best part about The Little Drummer Boy is its wholesome simplicity. The fact that it is so unabashedly religious is its strongest point in my opinion. Chasing the hate out of your heart and replacing it with love is a valuable lesson for all children. so I agree with another reviewer about its being a timeless family classic. It begins rather slowly but the last five minutes are absolutely outstanding and worth scanning back to watch a second time. The quotations from scripture give it its oomph but this also means that it would never be televised today on any of the big three networks. This might be a good DVD to buy because you probably won't catch it for free."
4,"I have a three year old. and a five year old. They got this movie today in the mail. and have watched it twice now. They love it! It makes sense on a level that they can understand. The story clearly describes the birth of Jesus Christ. and the true meaning of Christmas. I love the fact that the dialog and narration include actual Biblical scripture.(KJV) Wish I had seen this movie when I was a kid. Grew up in a Christian home. and understood the holiday. but not at the same age as my girls now do. Movie was made by the same company and in the same style as the Burl Ives Rudolph movie with the puppets. Already a Christmas favorite to be watched with all the other holiday favorites years from now!"
4,"I was pleased to see this video when it first came out and I recommend it very much. I watched it with my sons. who were born in 1965 and 1966. all the years they were growing up.  They are now fine parents themselves.  I  believe it expresses very well the true meaning of Christ-mas. The review  from T. Liptak says it very well.  It puts Christ back into Christmas where  He belongs.  It was and still is one of very few videos that tell what  Christmas is about - the greatest gift of all to a sad and needy world -  the gift of Christ. that's why we celebrate Christ-mas."
4,"Compared to today's standards. this little cartoon is a bit old-fashioned. although I wouldn't use primitive as one review suggested.  It's an oldie. for sure. dating back to 1968. and it used to be one of those films you saw every year.The story is great. and the little drummer boy has to suffer many things before he comes face to face with the Holy Family and the Christ child. and he learns that his gift - the drum - is equally treasured.A marvelous film!!!"
4,"This is a sweet story. about a poor little drummer boy who can only offer a gift of song to the baby Jesus. Even toddlers are quick to notice the stop-action animation and the distinctive soundtrack that was recorded by the Vienna Boys Choir. Our toddler called it 'Camel' as he loved to see the dancing animals which of course included a dancing Camel.The cast features voices you will recognize;Jos&eacute; Ferrer  - Ben Haramed [Voice]The Vienna Boys ChoirPaul H. Frees  - [Voice]Greer Garson  - Storyteller [Voice]Ted Eccles  - [Voice]Jules Bass ad Arthur Rankin. Jr.  - Directed. Produced. and wrote this christmas classic.BOTTOM LINE: A Christmas Classic for the whole family that never wears out!"
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
4,"Despite one reviewer's comment. I think it is for children. as well as adults. because it brings back the true meaning of Christmas.  There's nothing 'scary' about the movie.  It's just a beautiful story that everyone. including children. can relate to in some way.I saw this movie when I was a young child and I never forgot it.  It had a huge impact on me in a great way.  It's a true Christmas classic. which is a rare thing."
4,"The collaborative work of Katherine Davis. Henry Onorati and harry Simeone. 'The Little Drummer Boy' is delightful retelling of a classic Christmas story and song wonderfully combined with the glowing. full-color illustrations of Ezra Jack Keats and the iconic music and vocals of John Jennings in superbly produced. flawlessly recorded. six-minute DVD format. A very highly recommended addition to family. school. and community library Christmas DVD collections. 'The Little Drummer Boy' is also available from Weston Woods in a Paperback/CD format (NPCD124. $18.95) and a Paperback/Cassette format (NPRA124. $14.95)."
4,"The Little Drummer Boy deserves a place alongside Rudolph and Frosty as one of Rankin Bass's vert best holiday classics. and where it may lack in eye candy and whimsy compared to other holiday favorites it more than makes up for it with a truly powerful and touching story. Now here's the sad part: the print master used for this DVD is absolutely horrible. especially in comparison to all the other Rankin Bass DVDs that have been released. I was shocked to see a picture quality that's inferior to even VHS recorded in SLP mode. Images are dark. murky. and full of scratches. I was even more shocked to see credit given to 3 people at the end for supposed 'film restoration.' How horrible must the unrestored print have been to get it up to sub-sub-par level? Sorry. but I don't buy it. This film deserves to be restored properly."
4,"This is one of the BEST RANKIN/BASS Specials!  It is heartwarming and shows the true spirit of CHRISTMAS.  Don't let anyone tell you that the material is too harsh for young children and it is still on TV during the Holidays.  This newest version of the DVD does not have the name RANKIN/BASS on the front cover as it should.  CLASSIC MEDIA should be ashamed of themselves.  This particular DVD also does not have the 35 mm print BUT this 16 A & B roll will have to suffice for now. since they have not found the 35mm print.  I Highly Recommend this DVD and I Highly Recommend that CLASSIC MEDIA/SONY WONDER give the proper credit on the next edition of this DVD."
4,"Just as the creators of HR Puffnstuff left a legacy to the children of the 60 and 70.s.Rankin Bass forever left some of the greatest treasures ever created.This Little Drummer Boy is not only a classic but can make you cry and get a lump in your throat every time you watch it.When the little Boys donkey is hit by a wagon he is rewarded by our lord who brings the donkey back to great health.if children today would watch these classics instead of watching the crap on tv or being on there cell phone at age 7 the world would be a much better place to live."
4,"This has always been and still is my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  I had it on VCR but had to switch over to DVD (probably have to switch again a decade or two from now).  I am in my 40's and still love to watch this very short movie at Christmas time.  With all of the advancements in animation these days. it is hard to convince my daughters that this is worth watching but it is the STORY that gets me every time.  They actually are learning to enjoy watching it with me."
4,"This is the 1968 by Rankin/Bass television special. The story is based on the Christmas song. The young boy Aaron. left orphaned when thieves invade his home. lives a life away from people. He has three dancing animal friends. the drum his parents gave him. and not much else. A greedy traveling showman exploits Aaron and his animals as a musical act. This dark story eventually turns and leads Aaron to the Three Wise Men and the journey to Bethlehem. Voice talent includes Greer Garson who narrates. Jose Ferrer as the showman (he sings too). Paul Frees as all three Wise Men. and the Vienna Boys' Choir singing the title song. one the best versions I've heard. I think with all the Frosty. Rudolph and Heat Miser your kids can watch. this would give them spiritual balance during the holiday."
4,"I remember watching The Little Drummer Boy on television as a child and was pleased to see that they are showing it on television during this Christmas season. The story is inspired by the evergreen Christmas song and the central character here is a little boy. an orphan who has lost his family in the most horrible way. This has resulted in his hatred and resentment toward others. and it is only through his musical abilities and his experience with the baby Jesus that his life changes for the better. The Little Drummer Boy learns that he does have something to give after all. in spite of his poverty. Greer Garson's narration is serious for the most part. yet also gentle. and Jose Ferrer also does a commendable job. This is a short animated feature and though its old-school animation may be out of date. the story remains a classic that is worthy of being shared with children and adults."
4,"Honestly. is there any holiday movies being made now that are better than these old classics?  I just love this one and I'm so thrilled that someone out there had enough sense to put these older ones on dvd and video for generations to come.  It's a real bummer during the holidays if you accidentally miss one on television - it doesn't come around again for another year so this definitely is a must.  I love Fred Astaire's narration of this and now you can even buy the matching toys to it!  How neat!  I about lost it when I found Fred Astaire and his little mail truck in the local Meijer's store the other day.  Way too cute. along with the snow monster. Mr. Warlock.  It's just a very cute way of showing how Santa first came about and even Mrs. Santa.  You can't miss with this story and it belongs in everyone's Christmas collection."
4,"I caught this on ABC-TV tonight as I was flicking the channels.  Every year at this time this airs.  I've seen it countless times over the years.  What else can be said?  It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better. more authentic. and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials. which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway. everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a &#34;prequel&#34; of sorts. telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle. the dungeon. and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.I highly recommend this Christmas classic over any CGI-animated piece of garbage they make today."
4,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Santa Claus is Comin' to town. It's a heartwarming story with tons of good & memorable characters with lots of great songs to boot. The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall. despite.some silly moments & plot holes.it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10."
4,"I loved this as a kid.  So I figured I'd get it for my kids.  And they liked it too. despite the hilariously hokey special effects (hokey to them). so that's why I gave it 3 stars.But for me. for all the christmas specials. this is the worst.I couldn't believe the 'Sit on my lap' song.  Really. Some strange creep comes to town and trades kisses and lap sitting for toys - he should have been arrested for that alone.And then the way they tied everything to the song was really irritating.  Plus. why did the young man have an old man's voice? Annoying."
4,"This is an enjoyable telling of how Santa Claus became who he is today. Keep in mind that this story is completely fabricated by the minds of Rankin/Bass. not the real history of how the myth of Santa Claus evolved. With that in mind. it is quite inventive.Where did he get his red suit?Why does he go down the Chimney?What about his reindeer and his 'Ho Ho Ho'?These questions and others are all answered as a young boy grows to manhood while a despotic mayor forbids toys of every kind in his town.It's not quite the same storytelling level as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. but it is done well enough."
4,"Wow. this Christmas classic answers all of the little ones' inevitable questions about the origin of Santa. the use of stockings. the use of a chimney. how reindeer fly. etc. In the middle of the main story is a villain. the Warlock. who is transformed from an evil figure to a good one as a result of Santa giving him a toy. Meanwhile. the mayor of Sombertown is determined to uphold his ban on toys. much to the chagrin of Jessica. who is falling in love with Kris Kringle (Santa). As always. the Rankin Bass specials aren't complete without a message; in this case. it's good defeating evil. goodwill and love over hate and persecution. The story is narrated by Fred Astaire. who does a fine job. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town stands as one of the true classics. and belongs in everyone's animated Chrustmas collection."
4,"The film has it's own value. but some people underestimate the work by the team that made all of these films. todays CGI animation is great but the quality of such recent CGI hits in theatres wouldn't be there if this team never existed. The blazed the trail the same way Lewis and Clark blazed the trail across the united states and the work in all these films proves it because of how the stand the test of time. Besides. the cast of these films in beyond stellar they are legendary. Not &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF TTHE BOARD&#34; was in one along with other ledgends and if it's good for &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD&#34; it perfect for my household."
4,"This is probably the best animated Christmas story of all and definitely one of the most remembered. Who can forget about Sam the Snowman. Herbie (I want to be a dentist). Yukon Cornelius. the Abominable Snow Monster. and of course. Rudolph. I have watched this every year for at least the last 25 years. But now I don't have to check the TV Guide to find out when it's coming on. I can watch it whenever I want. When I was young. I used to wonder if my toys talked (wonder if this is where Toy Story got their idea). A perfect family movie that will make you laugh. cry. and be a little frightened. Excellent is all I have left to say."
4,"If you like Christmas movies besides 'The Nightmare before Christmas'. you should add this one to your collection. If you don't like Christmas movies then buy 'The Grinch' or 'The Christmas Carol' and see what you act like Grinch/Scrooge. In my humble opinion this is the best telling of Rudolph's story in a musical. Many added side stories with Hermey the dentist. Yukon Cornelius. Abominible Snowman. and the Island of Misfit Toys adds to make a great story. The animated figures are excellent and smooth motioned. Excellent narration by Burl Ives. The music is first rate and will have the family singing along."
4,"WOW this is a DVD?!?The show is as it was in the TV release and the extras do bring it to the modern day but I think they (Sony Wonder/Golden Books) could have packed all the shows on One DVD instead of making you buy  3 of them... Look to Warmer Bros. Year w/o Santa Claus...Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Frosty could have made it all in this DVD... Well I got it in the collection and saved some over buying them one at a time...Enjoy the show and worry where the popcorn money will come from later..."
4,"What makes this little film so special is so varied and precious. that it's hard to identify one area.  Of course Rudolph is the main character. as is his little girlfriend.  Then there's Burl Ives. who narrates it. and the wonderful music of Johnny Marks.  I perform his music every year. it's so upbeat and inspirational.  That he was asked to write the music for this movie was no surprise.The animation is a little dated. but the kids won't mind.  You won't find this kind of movie made anymore.  It has so many nice qualities. not to mention Santa and his elves. and the Isle of Misfit Toys. and the 'Bumble.' and Cornelius of the Yukon.I laugh as I think of all this. and it's a sweet smile. and a great film for Christmas!!!"
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
4,"This is one of those Christmas movies that you can't get through the holiday season without seeing at least once. The animation is charming and the story a classic one... This movie is a sad/sweet Christmas story that usually makes me want to cry. Why couldn't they just accept Rudolph?All about the greatness of Santa's most famous reindeer and how his 'UNUSUAL' abilitys came to use one Christmas Eve you can't help but love this small misfit little reindeer and neither can Santa.Their is something magical and charming about this classic Christmas story that makes kids believe and adults wish that they could. This is definately one of those Christmas movies that WILL never go out of style and will be around for generations. Definately a movie that you should buy if you have children or grandchildren- they'll enjoy this Christmas classic as much as you will..."
4,"'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' is an enchanting classic narrated by Burl Ives that kept my full attention as a child and is still wonderful to watch. Rudolph encounters rejection from friends and family and runs away from home when he is fortunate to meet Hermey. an elf who longs to be a dentist. and Yukon Cornelius. a gruff miner looking for gold. On their way. they sail to the Island of Misfit Toys promising to let Santa know of their neglected existence. After a horrible storm threatens visibility. Christmas is almost 'canceled' until Santa discovers Rudolph's shiny nose.Catchy Christmas songs and animation makes 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' a wonderful addition to anyone's movie collection!"
4,"As I watch this movie for over the 50th time. have to laugh more and more. The movie is fun. yet have to wonder how Santa tolerated the elf and reindeer bullying. Reindeer tease poor Rudolf because of his nose. The elves tease poor Herbie because he doesn't want to make toys. and the head elf makes him work through his ten minute break. a true labor law violation.The Land of Misfit Toys is quite the site. can't help but to blame the elves for such mistakes. And why santa never knew about this place. since he knows everything and everyplace.The Abominable Snowman is more funny than scary. and is very entertaining.Always a classic and the flaws in the plot have holes bigger than the Grand Canyon. but that adds to the fun.A great way to enjoy a night by the fireplace with the family and friends."
4,"We were finally able to put the RANKIN/BASS name w/ a photo cover THANKS to Alexander Drosin and the kind folks at GOLDEN BOOKS and SONY WONDER!  The Extras on here were much needed and give the consumer much more for their $.  You would think that companies that release DVDs of this kind would naturally include extras BUT sometimes your assumption could be wrong....THANKFULLY not here.  Hopefully. we will be able to add more material (Check part II of my TVPARTY.com article) and I will certainly discuss all the material in my new book &quot;The Making of RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER:  The Longest Running. Highest-Rated TV Special in History.&quot;  Visit us at RANKINBASS.com for more info and BUY this DVD!  This will send the companies that make these DVDs a message.....MORE EXTRAS! and PHOTO covers!  Rick Goldschmidt"
4,"I spent many Christmas seasons of my childhood waiting for Santa and watching this movie.  Having it in my collection now will rekindle all of those happy thougths and make the Christmas season all the brighter as I will not have to wait for it to show up on my television.The story is a simple. sweet tale of frienship. trust. and overcoming problems.  It shows how to have confidence in yourself and be able to help others in the same situation.  Everyone has a place in society regardless of how they look (Rudoplh. misfit toys) or what they do (Herbie. the elf who wants to be a dentist).The animation is amazing when you realize that this is not computer generated.  It had to be done by hand. frame by frame.  That alone makes this a classic in the art of entertainment."
4,"The 'mother' of all classic kids Christmas tales. and this series just moves at the brisk pace of Santa's sleigh on Xmas eve. While other similar shows seem to have parts to allow time to run errands in the home between 'good scenes'. this show snaps it's melodic fingers. and makes you drop the tablecloth. A very warm. engaging. and wonderful cast with songs that actually hit the charts by other famous singers. make this one and only of it's kind. A family adventure for the ages. and then some. Burl Ives makes his grand entrance ala singing snowman. and ties the story of Rudolph's troubles all together. One more thing. for a puppet. that Santa is pretty darn convincing. Rudolph's friend. and fellow misfit elf Herbie. is also a unique character all his own. The sets are nothing short of dazzling. and the effects just add to the atmosphere. without distracting or looking out of context. Excellent all the way-ho. ho. ho!"
4,"I was 12 years old when Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer had its premiere. and there have only been a few instances where I've missed the annual showing of this holiday classic. The DVD version I purchased--which incorporated several edited sections. as well as a &quot;variant&quot; song--literally brought tears to my eyes.  Not only was the print pristine in every way. I hadn't realized just how heavily edited Rudolph had become! To see it in its original form is a real treat--and I highly recommend purchasing this remarkable DVD to anyone who appreciates Christmas nostalgia.  Why wait till the Yuletide season? With this gorgeous DVD. it can snow year-round!"
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
4,"Yes. it is I. the Edit Avenger!!Here to protect freedom and original art from plunderous corporations and soulless individuals!!!!If you are considering purchasing a 2004 or later release of 'Rudolph'. think twice. It is edited.I just ordered the original 2002 UNEDITED/no Destiny's Child 'Rudolph' DVD from eBay express. I got it sealed for $6.99 + $3 shipping.Do NOT buy edited DVDs when you can avoid it. Let's send the message. If you don't think that you make a difference remember this:Consumer complaints about the edits in 'Beavis and Butthead Mike Judge Collection Vol 1' were 100% of the reason that volumes 2 and 3 were released with absolutely NO edits whatsoever to the material.Good for us!Edits are for losers!I have spoken."
4,"As I sat with my precious 4 year old granddaughter and watched this video one more time. I smiled.This is one of those movies that you share with each little one that comes into your life.Watching her eyes glow as the story unfolded brought me such joy; and listening to her trying to remember all the reindeer names brough a chuckle.How could anyone not love this classic? It will be a tresure to share with every generation.  If you have not seen it. which would be hard to believe. I highly recommend it.  Wonderful"
4,"Okay. so I'm reliving the past with this classic... And classic it is. If you're a sap over the holidays. and still expect the jolly big dude. to be coming down your chimney on Christmas eve. then this is a video for you.As a matter of fact. three of recent Santa Clause movies that really get me into the spirit are the Tim Allen movies by Disney: The Santa Clause 1. 2. and 3. Great movies (along with this classic) to watch on a cold Winter's night...The Santa Clause"
4,"The story: priceless.  Rudolph the outcast becomes Rudolph the celebrated.The songs: timeless.  Burl Ives crooning in his warm voice makes this winer wonderland a cozy place to hang out.The animation: creative.  Eclectic.  They don't make them like this any more and that's too bad.  From the salt used as water fizzle to the black gum drop used as Rudolph's temporary nose this movie has more charm that a 100 CGI flicks.The characters: relatable and wild.  From the elf that wants to be a dentist instead of a toymaker to that great. white terrifying furball to Yukon Cornelius and his taste for snow.Nice extras on the Golden Books/ Sony distributed DVD.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas and let Rudolph's nose help it be bright!"
4,"Let's face it: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer has been an iconic symbol of the American-made stop-motion animated Christmas special. This 1964 classic carries a special message of forgiveness and kindness. as a tormented Rudolph finds his place in the world after having run away from his peers. Seeing what their actions did to poor Rudolph. they come to accept him as an equal. and perhaps admire his gift of a shiny nose that saved Christmas. Burl Ives is the perfect narrator. who sings two signature Christmas songs. SILVER AND GOLD and HOLLY JOLLY CHRISTMAS. This special has all the right sights and sounds for its kind. Do yourself a favor and purchase this DVD for a nostalgic look at the origin of the stop-motion television Christmas special."
4,"A tape or DVD of this show should be owned by every family in America. The level of care and loving craftsmanship seen here is something we are likely never to see again in the production of a film or show for children.This is demonstrated most of all. of course. in the music.'Silver and Gold'. 'Holly Jolly Christmas'. 'We Are Santa's Elves'.'There's Always Tomorrow'. 'The Most Wonderful Day of the Year'(whose eyes can stay dry through that one?) - all original compositions with full orchestral and choral accompaniment for a single TV show!For generations now. 'it isn't Christmastime until 'Rudolph' comes on'. Even if the networks give up airing it. I know my family will be cueing up this video every year the calendar's page is turned to December - I hope your family will be too."
4,"Underdog was one of my favorites when I was five years old. and watching the DVD reissues brought back wonderful memories. I ordered these for my son who is five years old as a means of obtaining quality programming in the English language. We are living in Germany where Underdog is relatively unknown. My son was fascinated by the episodes. watching them with wonderful childlike awe. not bored at all. And I enjoyed the occasional references to the adult world (Lucitanic. Hopeless Diamond. etc.). I'm glad I ordered this set.Before ordering I checked the Amazon customer ratings of the individual DVDs. I. too. think it's a shame that the cliffhanger episodes were spliced together. This takes away some of the series' charm. for those familiar with the original format. But there's so much charm going around in this that it almost doesn't matter. Therefore I chose to give five stars. If another packaged set comes out next year I'll probably order it. as well."
4,"I grew up in the 1970s. and I have a lot of great memories of watching &quot;Underdog&quot; on TV.Unfortunately. the people who made this DVD have chosen chose to deliberately ruin the cartoons. Apparently. the cliffhanger endings that were in the original require too much of an attention span for today's Ritalin addicted audience. and so these segments have been deleted. Other parts of the cartoon have also been tampered with. And what happenend to Tennessee Tuxedo and other characters that I could have sworn were part of the original show?I love classic animation. but because of the various alterations that were made for this DVD. I cannot recommend it to anyone. in any way. for any reason."
4,"When I was just a little boy. my heart was filled with glee whenever my friend Underdog appeared on my TV.  From lovable. humble shoeshine boy to dynamic flying hound. no better television show for childhood could be found.  Now that I am older. I find (oh happy glee) that Underdog can once again be seen on my TV.  This Collector's Set Edition. so carefully restored. can once again be purchased. to view or just to hoard. But I have a niece and nephew. ages four and six. just about the age to love this canine's cartoon tricks.  I think that they will be amazed and find it quite sublime to make friends with an Underdog who lyrically fights crime.  So let's lift a toast to Underdog. a hero for all time. and I hope you will forgive me for reviewing this in rhyme."
4,"Did I miss something that the other reviewers saw? Or did I get a defective DVD set? This set would have been alot better if Classic Media kept Underdog as the original TV series. Each Underdog episode was initially shown as a serial with cliff-hangers. In between each cliffhanger was a short like Tennesse Tuxedo. What Classic Media did was to run each episode in one complete uninterrupted showing. This takes away from the original series' charm. The &quot;Cliffhanger episodes&quot; are banished into the features section which is a shame because the cliffhangers are classics in and among themselves. The features would have been better if they interviewed some of the actors such as Don Adams or even some of the people involved with the production such as Howard Stern's father. Ben. Instead you get co-creator Joe Harris' creepy account of a never before seen Underdog episode written for two girls."
4,"WOW!Underdog is one of those shows that doesn't get nearly the attention it deserves.  It's been decades since I've seen or heard anything about the show.  As such. I was surprised at all the little gems hidden in these classic shows.  I loved seeing things like Simon Barsinister 'The meanest man in the world'. creating machines to help him 'rule the world'.  Do you remember some of them?  Like his machine designed to shrink everyone in the world to 6 inches tall?  'With my new shinking gun. I'll be the tallest man in the world!'It was great re-living those great memories again."
4,"ANOTHER American cultural icon from the 60's has beendeemed unacceptable by those who would prefer to seemalice where none exists.Not even Underdog can escape the slings and arrows ofthose with the same mentality as the book-burners of1930's Germany.Why do we allow such obvious Orwellian 'Newsspeak' toedit our past? Come on... this IS a cartoon. for Pete'ssake. NOT some social/political statement.Nothing here needs to be edited or 'cleaned up'. Theseare simple 'good vs. evil' stories with a happy ending.and should be offered in their entirety... music/songs.credits and all.And. if one is offended by ANY of this... then one mayexorcise one's freedom NOT to purchase such!Nuff' said..."
4,"Love seeing these cartoons in PERFECT re-mastered condition and bright colors.  Over the years. they have aired on channels including CARTOON NETWORK in washed out 16mm prints.  I would have preferred that the original titles remain. BUT at least they did put the original open to the series for each UNDERDOG episode.  All in all...a GREAT DVD set!  For this box set. CLASSIC MEDIA also re-did the covers for VOLUME 1 &amp; 2 and they are much IMPROVED!  Rick Goldschmidt  RANKIN/BASS Historian"
4,"It's a bird. it's a plane. it's...UNDERDOG!Wow. I had forgotton about this cartoon (except for those special appearnces at the Macy's  Thanksgiving Day Parade).  so imagine my delight when it was anounced that  UNDERDOG would be released on DVD.  This disc features a compilation of  Underdog episodes including rarely-seen episodes thought to be long lost.  And. for those dedicated UNDERDOG fans only. I heard a rumor that a $49.95  edition limited to just 1.000 copies will include a lithograph created by  Joe Harris. the original illustrator. especially created for the DVD.  For  the rest of us not willing to spend the cash. this regular edition will do  just fine."
4,"Julia is delightful. as always. However. the cooking here is very basic and rather repetitive. In the meat section. you learn how to pan fry a steak and how to deglaze the pan and make a sauce. Then you have essentially the same thing for a pork chop and a veal cutlet. You learn how to make a pot roast. followed by the same instructions but with chunks of meat to make beef stew. In the vegetable section. you learn how to boil various vegetables and finish them off with a dab of butter. Very basic. Lots of butter. heavy cream. and wine or vermouth added to almost every dish. The videography is not very well-lit for close-ups. so some of the food looks rather unappealing. I think this would be useful for someone who wants to cook basic American food and only knows how to microwave. But if you are already buying fresh ingredients and putting meals on the table. this will not really teach you much."
4,"This is a very basic cooking dvd. which I think is good for everyone. even if it's just a review.  I don't consider myself a novice cook. but I even got some techniques and tips from it.  I think just being in the presence of Julia is a good thing. like her teaching continues even though she is still not with us.The quality of my dvd's are just fine. not sure why that other reviewer had issues with the quality.  I wish Julia had done a series of vidoes.  Now you can only get a few of the old episodes of her French Chef cooking show.  Guess they didn't think of it back then.This is a great video for beginners and I think a great price. under $11."
4,"Cooking was a haphazard skill for me until I read Julia Child's 'The Way to Cook.' There are thousands of books that teach recipes. but very few about techniques. That is where Mrs. Child breaks from most cooking instructors and where she leaves an important mark.By explaining. quickly and simply. the most useful methods in the preparations of foods. she makes clear. with positive attitude. enthusiasm and reassurance. how the novice cook can prepare meals expertly.The accompanying video series. now on DVD. does not have all the recipes listed in the book (that would take years to go through). but the techniques are all here. well organized and easy to master. I recommend both these videos and the book itself. for the latter goes into deeper details on how the theme-and-variation approach to recipes helps demystify cooking.Julia Child made a significant difference in my life. I am forever grateful to America's First Lady of Food for patiently teaching me the way to cook."
4,"As a devoted Julia Child fan I am very impressed with this DVD of Ms. Julia cooking EVERYTHING! The DVD is very user friendly. easy to navigate and beautiful in it's simplicity yet astounding in the amount of basic cooking techniques demonstrated! There are nearly 60 recipes on each of the Discs. The recipe booklet included with the 2 DVD Set is fantastic. Seeing each recipe come together- step by step - 'live and in living color' is extremely helpful along with knowing what the end result is supposed to look like! I can only wish I had had such a resource when I was a novice cook over 40 yrs ago! What a wonderful gift idea for a bridal shower. new college student or housewarming for a newbie starting out on their own.The Way To Cook DVDI never tire of listening to Julia's distinctive voice and watching her friendly. non-fru-fru mannerisms coupled with her impeccable class as a lady. a chef and an instructor. Once again dear Julia- Bravo. Bravo. BRAVO INDEED!"
4,"I think it's great that the popularity of a recent film (Julie & Julia) has once again brought Julia Child into the spotlight.  When this series first aired in the mid 80's. I remember watching it to learn the essentials of food preparation and short cuts.  The very day I found out it was available. I immediately preordered.This two DVD set comes with an instructional booklet.  On the first. you will find Poultry. Meats and Vegetables.  On the second. Soups. Salads and Bread. Fish and Eggs. and First Courses and Desserts.  Both DVDs are well chaptered. so if you just want to watch one particular sub-chapter. you don't have to sift through an entire topic in order to do so.  As always. Julia is instructive. professional and completely enthusiastic.  Buy this now (together with the companion bookThe Way to Cook) and. if you haven't already. also get the newly releasedBaking With Julia"
4,"This is not a teaching; this is an act as in action. The film's base on the Stations of the Cross; creates a Passion Play of great power. It's as close to a time machine as you might get; being plunged into another time zone. Sweet and rougher than usual; it's a great film to see. More horrific also; but redemptive.Blu-ray shows the great design and photography; as well as a powerful soundtrack. Two versions and chapters that reflect the stations. plus a DVD"
4,"The acting was fine. but I fail to see the point. We've got a guy with a thorny crown. covered with blood. hauling a cross. He falls down. Evil Roman soldiers beat him for falling down. He gets up and hauls it some more. He falls down again. They beat him again. Etc. I just don't understand why we need to see anyone. Jesus Christ or anybody else. taking such an ass kicking. What was it. 90 minutes out of 100? We need some more story here. Mel. I was glad when Jesus died so I could change the channel. Oh. there was a brief resurrection. Two seconds. sunlight through a hole in his hand. Michael resisting the urge to make a horrible joke about eating M&Ms this close to Easter Sunday."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
4,"I wanted to watch in the privacy of my own home instead of a theater with others.  This is a private thing and an individual faith issue.  I was very curious and wanted to be impartial. I heard about the graphic's and a lot of reviews against MG and wanted to see for myself first. TOTALLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!! I talked to a fellow congragation member just tonight because of all of the questions going thru my head & heart.  Then I found & printed the Catholic mystic from another viewer & I TY very much.  I'm gonna look that up!  I was under the impression it was all from the 4 Gospels & now I know better. Now I'm waiting for the collectors edition whenever it is released!!"
4,"'The Passion of the Christ' is a deeply moving masterpiece. It is entirely faithful to the spirit and. within the bounds of artistic license. the letter of the Gospel narratives. It contains not the slightest trace of anti-Semitic influence or message. Charges that it does are not merely false; they are slanderous.  Focusing narrowly and excruciatingly on His passion. this may not be the right movie to lead someone to Christ. but it is the right movie to lead a Christian back to the profound. piteous. inescapable truth at the heart of his faith: that God endured unimaginable suffering and death for my sins. and for yours."
4,"I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously. because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time."
4,"Well this is one of the best gore movies I have ever seen. Pretty much that is what this movie is. 2 hours of a man being beaten and tortured. Ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and any Romero film. I actually was laughing near the end of it because of how over the top this movie is. How anyone can get a religious experience out of this is beyond me. Not to mention how hypocritical the religious nuts are to say they condemn violence yet they love this movie. Well if you are a horror film fan who appreciates good make up and gore then this ranks up there with some of the best. Who would have thunk that Mel Gibson would make one the goriest violent films of all time that would appeal to two different groups. As far as content goes and story line. this is not the movie for you. There is nothing of substance here. nope just two hours of beatings and torture."
4,"I'd like to give this movie a dozen stars. While I can not say I enjoyed it as entertainment. I've never seen a more powerful movie. GOD LOVES ME. screams from every second of film. It left me wishing I was less of a sinner. so that maybe just one less lash might have fallen. There is violence. but the love that made the violence necessary offsets it. It's life changing. I hate violence. I hate subtitles. as a protestant. I didn't get the Marian symbols. but I loved this movie. I prefer vhs to dvd. but this is one I want to dvd to get every bit of everything about the movie. Don't read the da vinci code. watch this movie. That's what Christ is about. not some half witted attempt to make Him less of who He is."
4,"It was a bummer finding myself looking at subtitles.  I also did not experience in the fervent passion and zeal that the movie was supposedly causing.I think the hype is a bit much for the product.I'd advise you not to have 'treats' or a meal as you watch this movie.  We need to remember that Caligula was mad for eating and watching gore at the same time.  This movie is pure ancient Roman gore.  This can't be too far of a cry from what Caligula enjoyed watching as he sat in his personal home eating and munching.A decent parent would never allow their child to see this movie.  It is the stuff Caligula had watched as a child and we know how he turned out.  It's unnerving to think of how many 'Boots' sat out in those movie theaters. and how many are now sitting in the livingroom with  'mummsy and dahdah.' I mean we're talking graphic angles of torture devices on the skin as never before seen etc."
4,"I was raised Catholic and still am a Catholic as I go to mass now ever Sunday even though I didnt go for awhile in my early 20's. I left the theater feeling like a bad Mary Magedeline. It was a great movie though but not great that you want to watch it over and over. The androgynous Satan was really creepy. I felt like the bad Catholic that I have been after watching this. As a kid I used to like going to 'The stations of the cross' events at the church during Easter but this is so graphic all it did was make me feel like a bad Catholic and that I need to go to confession really bad."
4,"The TRUTH is that Christianity offers a solution to those who have problems in life. Christianity is not the same as catholicism or related with the bad things done for over the centuries by the catholic church - like the evangelisation and slavery to the native people of different continents such as Africa and America's and the Holy Inquisition!It IS Universal! The Laws of Christ are the laws that we - who live in a democratic and free country - still use! If Jesus have died to save the problems of mankind we should be must be thankfull in the year of the Lord 2005! Still His Birthday for us to remember! Always!The meaning of this Mel Gibson's masterpiece is based on the universal message of Christ!"
4,"This movie was very hard to watch because His death WAS very ugly. yet I personally believe it to be accurate with what the Bible says.Although I don't know all the beliefs in all the Religions.I have read the Gospels in the Bible. and it seemed the movie played out just as the Bible read.The movie only focuses on the last 12 hours of Christ's earth life.And although it is hard to watch. It's a great reminder of the Gift that was given to us all.The performances are nothing less than spectacular. and I found this movie to be deeply touching."
4,"Mel Gibson's movies often involve torture. usually of Mel himself. It's pointless to speculate on the source of Gibson's self-loathing and contempt. but being raised as a fundamentalist. anti-Semitic catholic may have something to do with it. Mel's psychopathology is taken to its ultimate extreme in this lengthy. plotless. graphic depiction of torture. There is no plot. no spirituality. no message. just an innocent man being flayed. It is blatant Sadean voyeurism using a mask of religion to conceal the fact that its creator is sick. sick sick. It is revealing that this movie was so popular in a country that would elect another sick. ignorant fundamentalist for its President."
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half-deluded gospel scenes.Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church.Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
4,"Without a doubt I was totally shocked.  The scenes involving Christ being whipped and smacked around were just... too much.  To be completely honest. I thought the amount of violence that poor Jesus had to go through during his final moments was too much to withstand.  The movie is basically one scene involving lots of pain for Jesus right after another. and it gets to the point after a while where it all becomes extremely disturbing.The wide screen picture quality is perhaps a bit *too* wide (since there's more black above and below the actual picture on screen compared to most movies) and having to read text throughout the movie because none of the characters spoke in english was another small complaint (but I understand the developers were going for absolute realism here. hence the controvery surrounding the film).Just shocking the way Jesus was treated."
4,"There was so much speculation before 'The Passion of the Christ' opened. and I truly believe the naysayers were just blowing smoke.  Yes. it is a very violent movie. but not gratuitous Hollywood violence.  After all. bludgeoning and cuxifiction are both extreme acts of violence and suffering and this is what is depicted in the movie.  Mel Gibson did an excellent job.  I would not recommend this movie for youngsters due to the violence.  Very mature young teens may be able to handle it."
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
4,"This is a 'graphic' portrayal of the last 12 hours of Christ's life on Earth. It is inconceivable that any human could endure the physical trauma/torture/abuse inflicted by the Romans. Perhaps that was a major point intended by the film-maker(s). It is hard for anyone to know exactly what all transpired during those twelve hours. but this movie does a good job of mixing speculation with scripture creating an intense 2 hours of entertainment. Great sets and performances. Speaking in Aramaic and Italian added a bit more credibility but required the viewer to read subtitles which interferes with watching the action. It would be great if there were an English language dubbed version to watch. Jim Caviezel's performance was awesome."
4,"Many hate it. many love it and never will everybody agree to disagree. So. here's my view which only means something to me. You can say what you want about Mel Gibson but he really nailed it here. This story. so simple in it's broad. cinematic release simply tells the tale of Jesus. a simple spiritual giant who came. taught. and was killed because of these teachings. More importantly. throughout the movie we are shown how to pray properly and the true battle of good and evil (which is really harmless if we know this). All through the movie. we see the demons. Satan. the snake taunting Jesus and the important aspect here is how Jesus handled this. He gave no thought to evil and gave it no power. hence giving it no life. In the end. the metaphysical message is clear. if only we open our eyes."
4,"The passsion is the best movie about JESUS. It is far better than those syrpy bible movies insstead of ignoring the cruelty of the time it shows it in graphic detail. Jim cavezi is better in theJesus role than any one. the beatings are grusome  the crusifiicsion  is brutal with every detail shown. one inaccuracy is the damage to the templle the Bible says the curtain between the people and the highpreist was torn nothing else. the passion is the best if you havent seen it get it or rent it."
4,"Mel Gibson is an ok actor but his real talent is directing and movies like THE PASSION OF CHRIST or APOCALYPTO prove it. BRAVEHEART was quite good. too. but he's outdone himself with THE PASSION OF CHRIST.First of all. using Aramaic instead of English - thank you! Brilliant and brave idea!Secondly. casting Jim Caviezel as Jesus. stroke of a genius. this actor is absolutely believable in his role.And finally not shunning away from EXCESSIVE and prolonged violence. Think what you will of onscreen violence. but in this film it's a must. Christ's suffering and his sacrifice do not come across as well without these violent scenes. which is why other movies about the crucifixion are not as powerful as Gibson's film.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is definitely not for children and without the religious context this would have most definitely been an NC-17."
4,"So many well-meaning Christians have found something to like about this film that I. a lifelong film buff but also a Christian. hesitate to express my views. Alas. I find little about this film that is likeable or meritable.First. the makeup and prosthetics were lamentably bad! The film had the feel of a concoction. For me. it lacked depth. gravity. artistic impact. rather like watching someone paint by numbers. or else place ingredients into a jar and shake them up. hoping they will come out arranged in some artistically rewarding order. Where was the inspiration?The one scene I liked- and I liked it very much- was when Jesus was at home and working as a carpenter. It boded so well...Alternatives? 'Jesus' starring Brian Deacon. or even the silent 'King of Kings'- neither of which is unimpeachable. but both of which are preferable."
4,"Full of blood and gore but lacking any real sense of majesty. glory or spirituality.  Obviously the intention was to show the reality of what Christ endured. giving us a better appreciation of his sacrifice.  For devout Christians. I can understand how they might bring their own sense of faith and &#34;passion&#34; to the intensity of what's being shown.  But as a film. and as a historical account. it expressed a lot of pain and agony but not a great deal of depth.  I don't believe for one second Mel Gibson was inspired by God to make this. and that kind of talk is just crazy fanaticism.  Visually. the movie looked very closed in and confined. when there should've been a feeling of expansiveness.  &#34;Braveheart&#34; was more inspiring and epic than this. which shouldn't be the case.  In fact. I was more moved by Jesus Christ Superstar than &#34;The Passion.&#34;"
4,"First I would like to say thank you to Mel Gibson.  You have delivered the most powerful movie that I have ever seen.  Even with all of the controversy. you have stood by your film and I salute your commitment and passion for your work and your faith.This is an amazing movie.  Yes. there are very many appalling scenes of Jesus being beaten and crucified.  This movie made me tear up in many parts. especially when Jesus saw his mother Mary and gained strength. after a brutal lashing. to continue carrying his cross to his eventual death.  This movie really made me realize one thing.  Any time that I feel as though I am sacrificing alot. I will think back on the punishment Jesus recieved for our sins and realize how ridiculous I am."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
4,"I just saw that Amazon is starting this new group of reviews. while it changed the other DVD reviews (to VHS - even though it was for a DVD too...come on. it was only a little over a year ago...). For what reason? There are almost 2.000 great reviews of this movie (on average). but that is not represented here. I think the public will want to know. also.It's a shame people are so ready to tear down a person who has made a mistake. rather than trying to show understanding and forgiveness. 'He who is without sin. cast the first stone.' Lots of stones being thrown here. and I for one. do not appreciate it."
4,"Since I have accept Him as my Lord and Savior. This movie was able to remind what He went through for me. How great His love is. Even when I have people who hate me. I should be thankful that I don't have to go through what Christ went through for me. Its starts at the garden where Judas betrays Him. to his trial where their is an emotional scene for me. to him carrying to the cross. to his death. I cried so much more than I cried watching the movie in theaters. I love Jesus.John 3:16 ' For God so loved the world that He gave His only son so that whoever believes in Him willn't perish but have eternal life.:"
4,"this movie. in a very graphic way. shows how CHRIST died at the hands of violent people who did not  know who he was. but JESUS  was willing to endure his fate..when i think of my children it is so hard to understand GODS deep love for his children. that he gave his only BEGOTTEN SON. i am so glad that he loves us that much.....a wonderful movie. it is very heart wretching and someone with a heart condition should be very careful when they watch it.....mell gibson is my most favorite director................"
4,"As someone who has read a few books about the physical suffering Jesus went through. I was amazed at how real the physical events were portrayed in this movie; almost like Mel Gibson took a time machine and filmed the crucifixion as it took place.  Now if we could only build a time machine to send the critics back in time.Even non-JesusFreaks should admit this movie was filmed to perfection.Every actor was great.  Every scene captivating.  Every word. needed.  Not only was this a great movie. it is fact.  The most real FACT there has ever been.  The man (God) on that cross took those nails for all of us...even those that dare reject His sacrifice.  Buy this movie and share it with friends - believers and non-believers.God Bless!(...)"
4,"There's so much debate about the violence of this movie that it may scare some from watching it. But Mel Gibson makes it known that he doesn't want to elaborate on the physical suffering of Jesus as much as he wants to elaborate on the courage and strength of Jesus to do God's will. Seeing him tremble and Pray to God made me feel closer to Jesus in that we know what torture and suffering he would face. The fact that we see Jesus as Human in those last hours is what makes the whole Movie moving. There are scenes that will make a person cringe. But the last scene of Jesus resurrection gives hope and almost purges those feelings of despair. This movie depicts true Love and Hope through even the most darkest hours. Other than some rather cheesy scenes and some overdramatic irony the movie should remain a classic for it's indie aspirations and block buster accomplishments."
4,"This depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ is certainly powerful.  For many. myself included. the crucifixion of Christ had become little more than a part of the window dressing of Christianity.  The familiar images of a Caucasian Christ on the cross had lost their power to horrify. and in turn had lost their power to communicate the suffering and sacrifice that lie at the heart of the central event of the Christian faith.  Director Mel Gibson restores its terrible. gritty reality.  This is a fully human Jesus that experiences unimaginable torment. not a primarily spiritual being existing above the mortal plane who is merely going through the motions for the benefit of mankind.  I am not a Christian. but I feel that I have gained a greater appreciation and understanding of the Christian faith for having seen this film.  This is not a film to 'enjoy.' but it is a powerful experience that has something to offer to anyone with an open mind."
4,"I needed strong drink to wash my mouth out after sitting through POTC. the most distasteful film I've ever seen.  The only benefit from watching it was the sense of duty to warn others off. Like incinerating an insect under a magnifying glass. Gibson accentuates a few verses in the story of the last week of Jesus into a gruesome. disgusting. gratuitous gorefest.  Maybe it helps one's appreciation to believe that Jesus died for our sins (which I don't). but even in that case. I don't think that Gibson's relentless portrayal of violence adds much to the magic."
4,"AT FIRST I DID NOT WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIEIT WAS NOT IN ENGLISH AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BORINGWHEN I SAW THIS MOVIE IT DID NO ONLY TEACH ME ALOT BUT OPEN MY EYES TO ALOT OF THINGS.THE MOVIE IS ABOUT THE LAST DAYS OF CHRISTCHRIST IS PUT THREW SOME HORRIBLE THINGS THAT NO MAN ON EARTHCOULD STAND UP TONOT ONLY DID HE GO THREW THESE THINGS HE PRAYED FOR THE MEN THAT WAS DOING THEM TO HIM.WHILE I WAS WATCHING THIS MOVIE I DID NOT FEEL LIKE I WASWATCHING A MOVIE IN SUB TITLES IT FELT LIKE I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING WITHOUT READING THE SUB TITLES.FOR EVERY ONE THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ALL"
4,"Mel Gibson's epic masterpiece is the feel good hit of the summer! Tina Turner shines in her role as Mary (especially in the memorable scene where she defiantly sings 'Better Be Good To Me' while pleading her case before Pilate (a never funnier Adam Sandler!) and the casting of Bobcat Goldthwaite as Jesus is pure genius. Gibson's decision to have the cast speak the entire dialog in Esperanto points to his trademark attention to historical accuracy and detail! The DVD is jam-packed with extras...an entire brownshirt uniform and a miniature replica of 'Mein Kampf' that you can read to the kids before bedtime! Hands down the best anti-Semitic propaganda film since Leni 'Oh c'mon. it's just a movie!' Reifenstahl's 'Triumph of the Will'! An excellent distraction from the war in Iraq and the 2004 election! Two steins up!!"
4,"'The Passion of the Christ' was one of the most controversial. famous. talked about films of the year 2004.  It was the cause for a lot of stir even before it was released.  Most people fail to realize all of that doesn't matter because Jesus Christ never existed!!  Jesus Christ is a mythological figure the church has exploited for hundreds of years and now the filmmaking industry has for almost a hundred years.  There is absolutely no archeological or historical evidence that Jesus Christ existed.  Even if he did exist. it would be highly unlikely he would have received that kind of punishment.It is a shame a con artist like Mel Gibson is using this mythological character to make millions of dollars.  People have to start swaying away from the manipulations of the church and the filmmaking industry and start looking at the hard facts.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ never happened and the so-called messiah never existed."
4,"I can't find this film moving in any degree. It is disturbingly graphic but not in an entertaining way (e.g. Pulp Fiction) or in a way that shakes the viewer's consciousness (e.g. the Grey Zone). Instead it presents a deeply dogmatic and outdated view of the final days of Jesus.  I am non religious yet I have seen films that opened the minds of viewers on the subject of Jesus from The Last Temptation of Christ to The Gospel According to Saint Matthew to Jesus of Montreal. What we have here instead is Mel Gibson's Birth of a Nation with a disturbing ideology that was savagely and appropriately lampooned on South Park's 'The Passion of the Jew' (kudos to Blockbuster for putting the two titles for rent next to each other)."
4,"I found the first half of the film to be very interesting and well done. Fine acting and production values.  Then it turned into an S&M porno movie.  The whippings with both the canes and the metal tipped whips caused me to fast forward through most of that scene.  It was gratuitous and I could just see the S&M set buying this dvd just to pleasure themselves while watching it. The other thing that bothered me throughout was the fact that the score from Jesus Christ Superstar kept running through my head as I watched it. I would give the movie around 4-5 stars if the quality of the story telling had lived up the the first half for the entire film."
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
4,"My review will not be nearly as sophisticated as some of the ones ive seen here. I will just say that as a lover of the epics i have seen most if not all of the movies dealing with the Passion. This one is the best by far in depicting the violent times in which this occured. I too have seen many Fulci and Argento movies which are very brutal in their own right. this one affected me much more due to the fact that whether you believe or not this is the type of torture Jesus. and many others endured in those times. 5 Stars for Mr. Gibson's masterpiece and 5 for the DVD quality."
4,"This is the best film I'm ever seen. It is more than a movie. seeing 'The Passion of the Christ' is literally a spiritual experience that will not leave you the same. You will be changed one way or the other after seeing what Jesus suffered. The realism of this portrayal captures the historical context of the days Jesus was on earth. Use of the original language adds to the authenticity. Similarly the ethnicity of the actors adds another layer to foundation of capturing history on film.This is an instant classic indeed. Any objective viewer who sees it cannot deny this fact. It is 'other.' i.e.. it is in a category of its own. Yes it might be listed as a 'religious film.' but it is so much more. The artists. producer. writers. creators who put this work together had the help of a Power beyond their abilities."
4,"Did Mel want do resell this video or was it because he wanted the art to speak for itself. then over time say his part?I didn't even know this was out until someone on the radio was discussing watching it. It seems like there was always a 'making of' planned for the DVD but with the controversy surrounding the film. it seems like he put this on the shelf until time had passed by.There was little to no promotion regarding this special edition as I mentioned. so I don't think this was about reselling as it is giving the fans of this film what they want.Time has passed to be able to watch the film. listen to the commentary and now get a peek behind the curtain.Braveheart is still my favorite of his though."
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
4,"I think everyone should see this movie at least once. Then never again. There is this cool book. the Bible. tells the whole story without all the blood and tears. I saw this movie with a group of my friends and we were all crying by the end. Even the ones who aren't religious. It is a very powerful movie. But not a movie I would want to see over and over again. Not only because there is not a lot of replay value. but also because of the sheer violence."
4,"I'd rank this movie right up the with the best of the slasher films. It is The Texas Chainsaw massacre or Faces of Death 5 of our generation. Just when you thought horrible fanatical death was only the perveiw of the cable news networks Mel Gibson gave us this gem of a gorefest. If you like blood. flaying. misplaced entrails and seeing a man brutally murdered this is the movie for you. Like other movies in it's genre it has no redeeming qualities but unmitigated brutality all there for you to see. What more could you ask from a movie. Now that we have this on DVD we can all sit back and enjoy the ride at home. Grab a 6-pack. a pack of smokes and turn on the surround sound and let every bone crunch and death scream remind you that movie greatness still exists in the new millenium."
4,"As a man. a prophet. the son of God...or any other way you see him. no one in their right mind would argue the greatness of Jesus Christ.  His philosophy. teachings. and sacrifices are beyond comprehension.However. i was not impressed with this movie.  The graphic detail that showed what he went through was moving. yes. but that was the whole movie.  Everyone knows what Jesus went through. so I didn't see it as necessary to drag it out for 2 hours with occasional flashbacks.I think it was like watching Braveheart. but having the movie begin where Wallace was captured. and covering for the most part his trial and torture. and ultimate death.  Then adding intermitent flashbacks of other parts of the movie.  I appologize to anyone this may offend. i recoginize that this is a sensitive subject. but I'm unimpressed.*Final point: this may be some of the best cinematography I've ever seen.  from that aspect I would give the movie six stars."
4,"you will love this movie its so real like and will move you. you will sit and cry all the way to the end. you will see howmuch of pain that christ went though. be careful about small children watching this movie. it has alot of  bad parts in itit show how christ was beat and his body with blood all over him. and when they nail him to the cross. these parts are so bad. not for children to watch. this movie will make you stop and think how much pain he went though for us. it changed my life."
4,"When I was younger. phrases like 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' seemed like ad slogans and I ignored them.Now that I'm older. it strikes me that the tale of Jesus Christ is indeed the greatest story ever told.  Whether it be true or false (historically) it has certainly attracted an enormous number of believers -- and. as an amateur historian with a large library of books about Christianity. I have little doubt that the main outlines of the story of Jesus are true.Which leads me to echo another reviewer: Is this the way we human beings treat God?  You might want to take a look at Dostoevski's tale of 'The Grand Inquisitor' (in his novel 'The Brothers Karamazov') for another perspective on the idea that human beings cannot live with the idea of God -- that we cannot tolerate it.Mel Gibson's terrific movie presents that horrifying idea in a way that will not be forgotten.  A cinematic masterpiece."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
4,"OK. I have to first admit that I'm anti - religious and I've always held the opinion that a religion-based nation is one that hasn't realized that we're living in the 21st century and not the 16th.  But that really didn't affect my reaction to this film. which is a brutal. trashy piece of Christ-propaganda.  Christ was not the only person of that time period who suffered through this much torture and brutality.  It was commonplace for people who had differences with those in authority to be beaten and executed.  Mel fails to explain what singled out Christ as a symbol of good because a)he is a shallow and poor filmmaker and b)he doesn't care. he just wants an excuse to show people lots of sickening violence to spark their guilt.  Don't allow yourself to be roped in by this exploitive nonsense; Jesus Christ himself would have taken offense to it."
4,"I know it was a great film but I did not want to see how brutally  they scourged Jesus I know I would cry and did not want to watch.Those that had to see it went to the show to view it I never felt I needed to see it to prove I believed because I did not need proof I believed it and never ever was in unbelief.Jesus is my Lord and Savior.I bought it used and it was perfect in every way I checked it out and the disc had no nicks in it.came on time. everything excellentI am glad I have it if someone wants to see it I will share it with them. I like to help others that want to know more about Jesus and who He is and what He did for us."
4,"5 Star'sThe film was very epic and showed  the suffering Christ absorbed for the children of God. The Pain of Mary seen through the eyes of her love for her son captured my heart. She as for Christ forgave everyone who tormented the only man that the only crime for spreading the Lord God message was crucified on the cross. The people that wanted Christ put to death condemned him because they were afraid and ignorant of change. Mass hysteria created by ignorance fueled the hotheaded masses to put Christ to death. Fear of the unknown at that era was the Justice the church & people wanted.  Christ knew he had to leave this mortal life on earth to a higher purpose. But his Love for mankind shunted his existence. For God for seen Christ end on earth and took him in his arms to  a higher existence where he could worshiped in the hearts of everyone who believed in him."
4,"Besides the religious backdrop. the main crux of this movie is to depict as much realism and authenticity as possible about the corporeal punishment during the Roman times. From the religious view point. the movie wants you to feel visually what your Lord has gone through.If you think that the 39 lashes were just mere whips. you are quite misinformed. Read Josh McDowell's book on Crucifixion and  you will get the written version about the instruments used during Jesus' time. Again. the crucifixion itself was shown under full light with no turning away of the camera.In my opinion. the movie has achieved. in stellar proportions. what it had set out to do. The additional depiction of Mary's love for her Son was well constructed. although not documented the way the movie has shown. All in all. the theatrical effects are moving and they are a good reminders for believers.Good work. Mel!"
4,"This movie is too much about the screenwriters interpretation of religion and their obsession with violence and not enough about the glorious creative & loving God of our world. There is only one God of our world. the creator. Yet. there are hundreds of man-made church organizations. Looking back through history one will see that the conflicts of man-made ideologies are a major source of war and other types of violence. We do not need this type of violent movie to have faith in our God.A movie composed of violence is exploitative of its viewers. There are no exceptions. Violence breeds evil and should not be depicted in any excess just for storytelling."
4,"There is nothing 'real' or 'realistic' about Gibson's portrayal of violence in this movie. It is. quite simple. an orgiastic celebration of pain and suffering. See the bad guys sneer and laugh as the blood splatters their faces with full Dolby sound effects! In many ways the violence in 'Kill Bill' is more subtle than this. Regardless of its historical accuracy (who cares?). this piece of celluloid is nothing more than one opinionated director's desperate--and unintelligent--flagellation of the audience. For the time capsule called. 'The Dumbing of America.' save room for this ridiculously overblown religious treatise that cheapens. not celebrates. the life of Christ. Pure drivel."
4,"I watched The Passion at my church saturday night.  This was the second time.  The first was when it came out and it was a lot to take in.  This time it was different.  It was far more spiritual the second time - a year later.Being done in the language of the day is HUGE.  Both times I saw the movie I got the feeling that I was actually witnessing the day Christ was crucified.  Now when i see movies about Christ that are in English I have trouble connecting with them and somewhat even taking them seriously.I suggest that anyone. who thinks that Christ did not take on the sins of the world. should see this film with an open heart and mind."
4,"Passion of the Christ is a must have DVD (or video)It is horrifying. graphic. detailed and yet enlightening.I cried through the entire movie. That's how much impact this movie had on me.Though sub-titled. it is easily followed. And since I just finished reading the Bible again. the scenes you can recall from the KJV Bible.Christ endured so much torture and agony for us to take away our sins. And this is not fiction. It is the TRUTH!Even if you don't believe fully in God and Jesus Christ. watch this movie. It just may change your mind on how His life was and what He went through for all of us.I love Mel Gibson as an actor. 'Maverick'. 'Lethal Weapon' series. etc. But as a director. I saw a true artist. This was his vision of how he saw what Christ endured. And he followed the Bible closely. Pure talent. Exceptional movie.A collectors item. definitely!"
4,"If you want to view an interpretation of Christ that reduces him to little more than a helpless idiot. watch this movie.  If you actually respect him. avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing. then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here. he is portrayed as a victim. dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there. just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message. love. pacificm. or teachings. it's a sensationalist view of his suffering. which doesn't fit well with the Christ story."
4,"I hated it from the beginning to the end.  The plot was too predictable with very little surprises.  The lines were weak and uninspiring.  You come to a point where you literally want to see Jesus die so that the suffering would end for the viewer. Talk about flogging a theme. this one wins. palms down!Again I got caught up with the hype and controversy. regarding this film.  I made a promise to myself that this would be the last film that I shall purchase. before I see it first. so help me God!"
4,"While to some the scenes of violence may be seen as excessive the emotional impact balanced it out it was never violence for the sake of violence but to show or attempt to show some of christs enourmous suffering. The scene with Mary picking Jesus up will soften most of the most hardened hearts. I love many of the 50's type bible epics but this one was the first to promote a real emotional connection. the fact thats its no in english will not bother you it actually enhances the film Mel gibson has hit the bash train latley I enjoy the majority of the films he directs the music the emotion and the fire i really appreciate about the guys films."
4,"In a world where most movies have a Hollywood twist and pervert the truth of the scripture. Mel Gibson has does a wonderful job showing the pain that Jesus Christ went through for all of us. James Caviezel does an excellent job playing Christ and showing the human side and physical pain! The location of the film (where it was shot) is absolutely realistic. the characters of the film are realistic and it felt as if I was there. Without the Spirit of God. you won't enjoy the film ... you'll call it a horror film. but this film so much more. Even if you don't believe that Jesus Christ was the Christ. it is still a powerful movie ... and the question that comes to mind is how another human torture another human can like that? It is just unbelievable that we can be that cruel!"
4,"If this movie was about anything else other than the passion of Christ the very people who support it would be screaming to ban it.  This is an incredibly violent film with needless buckets of blood. Seeing the son of God turned into hamburger did not inspire me or increase or decrease my faith.  Truly awful acting from secondary and tertiary actors and blatant homophobia in the Herod portion of the film add to a nasty mix.  Good acting from primary actors and superior cinematography are the few saving graces. The bold decision to make this multi-lingual and subtitled also deserves to be tried again.  Only for fundamentalist Christians and devout Roman Catholics and not be viewed by anyone under 17."
4,"I knew when I first saw previews for this movie and started hearing things about it. that I would not want to go see it. and if. for some reason. I did end up watching it. I would not like it. I was correct.First and foremost. this movie was incredibly boring. A good majority of the movie is spent watching Jesus get beat. hit. cut. or stabbed. I see no reason why anyone would enjoy watching this unless he is a sadist.The movie would get much lower than a five if it weren't for the scenes where it shows flashbacks that Jesus has with him spending time with his apostles. These scenes are uplifting. interesting. and sometimes humorous. The rest of the movie is just a bloody mess that seems to focus more on making you cringe than making you feel sympathetic."
4,"'The Passion of the Christ' is an extremely graphic motion picture that depicts the gruesome torture & death of Jesus Christ. I'm not going to give a summary about this film because everyone should already know what it's about. This movie was very dramatic. very emotional. and extremely unsettling. The film contains the most graphic scourging scene in movie history!!! I wouldn't let your children watch this. Wait until they get a bit older. The acting is superb. the story. script. and characters are incredible. The soundtrack is depressingly atmospheric. Whether you're a believer or not. this movie is well worth a look. You'll walk away a changed person."
4,"I saw the Passion of the Christ several months ago when it was first released in theaters. however it's message of unconditional love and selfless sacrifice remain indelibly etched in my mind. As any who have caught wind of the film well know. it is visually. the most graphic depiction of Christ's final hours ever conceived. Unlike many others though. I feel as though the its graphic nature only acts as a catalyst to enhance the viwer's grasp of the magnitude of the sacrifice Christ made to absolve us of our sins. Granted. it may be too violnet for others. especially those who are used to the archetypical. bloodless version of Christ's crucifixion. which we've become so accustomed to from movies past. My best advice to those who are debating on whether or not they're willing to see it. is that Christian or not. everyone can benefit positively from what this film has to say."
4,"The movie was based on the Bible which is historically correct.  This is the most powerful movie to date. A visually stunning cinematic experience.  While watching you should have a box of tissues handy because to know that Jesus suffered for us in that way you will not be able to help yourself from crying if not weeping.  I would recommend that everyone watch the movie even if you don't believe in Jesus.  The directing was done on an expert level by Mel Gibson and I commend him for putting this film out to the public."
4,"I'm a Christian and from day one I thought I have to go and see this. I went last night with a couple of friends and I'm telling the film was overwhelming. The film was so different yet excellent and you could feel what Jesus was going through. not just physically but emotionally and psychologically too. The film is basically about the last 12 hours leading to Jesus' death but there are a lot of messages portrayed in this film. It's one of those films where you watch and analyse for yourself. This film really makes you think and is so challenging not just for the Christian but for everybody. When the film was over none of us could speak. I was just in floods of tears. This is a warning to all mankind that Jesus is coming back soon....we don't when but he is so we all need to fix up and realize that life is not just on Earth here. This film is deep and should be seen by all....well done Mel Gibson may God Bless You....."
4,"I was amazed and brought to tears many times by this movie. it really showed the depths and breaths of Jesus' love for me and for the world. He's worth serving with all my heart. that is for sure.Mel Gibson did a fantastic job with this movie. Hopefully many lives will be changed. Go see it today!!Ignore the critics. it's not anti-semetic. it's not as violent as I thought it would be. For thoses who say it's a 'snuff film' you are barking mad! It's all make-up people. it's not real!! But His love and  word are."
4,"This was and is a riveting movie.  When I saw I at the theatre. it kept the audience quiet through most of the movie.  The brutality was not held back and matched the biblical description.  Reading and seeing are two different things and is the reason it's rating was meant to keep children from watching.  The one debatable scene was one regarding St. Veronica's encounter with reason which is a catholic belief and not necessarily biblical (Gibson is or was catholic).  If you want to relive Christ's crucifixion. this is it."
4,"I can sum it up in one sentence: The Worst Movie that I ever saw. I know that Christs last hours were horrifying. but this movie. the way it is cut. goes way beyond what the Bible says. It is like he wanted to make the goriest movie of all times. not a factual account of Christs last hours. It was so bad that I couldnt watch the whole movie. I wish the Mel Gibson had made a 'REAL' movie of his last hours. Save your money. and read the bible for the truth."
4,"The passion of the christ is a very moving. realisistic view of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus of nazareth. Never before has a movie rendered so much power and intensity and selflessness as this one does. If you haven't seen it yet- you will be amazed! And it isn't the jews that crucified Jesus. it is everyday people like you and me that sin against God. We are the reason he had to be nailed to a cross. And if any of you object to the violence and gore shown. walk a mile in Jesus' shoes- then you'll know what it's like."
4,"This wasnt about the Jews. or the gentiles. It was about the Son of Man coming to earth to redeem us. all of us. We had all sinned. we had all fallen short. Certain Jews & romans just happened to be the catalyst that fulfilled the prophecy...They could have been any denomination. but they happened to be in power then (all be it. thru the courtasy of the romans) and that was what was used.I do not in anyway hold the Jews responsible for the crusifixion of Christ. nor do I hope. do other Christians. People were used throughout history to forfill a destiny.Even Judas fate was sad to me as it seemed to fullfill the phrophesy and yet was regreted almost immediately upon reflection.Part of the confrontation however. I believe. was to bring the gentiles band in to the fold. Through Peter and Paul. The think we must remember is God workd on a bigger plan than you and I.Sorry if this is preachy. its just what I felt."
4,"Christ's compassion is there in a certain sense. but the love. and not the violence should be glorified here.Which term would Christ approve of more?  The glory of love or the glory of violence. I think it would be the former.Gibson should have concentrated on what Christ did to teach love in many different examples. not to let the violence go on and on and on and on and on.Three stars for effort...that's it.I still think Mel is a brilliant actor."
4,"I have this version and to tell you the truth have only watched once or twice since this version came out cause it is just way too violent even for a re-cut version. I understand it has to be realistic but Jesus whipping goes on what feels like for days. For a believer. it really does make you feel the extent of what Jesus went through in front of the Jews. If you don't mind the gore. then you will enjoy it. However. I kind of think I didn't need to purchase this movie a long time ago. Great to watch around Easter."
4,"This movie was great. my wife and I decided to go see it last Saturday night. Jesus was played by the young and attractive heart throb. James Caviezel. Jesus was taunted ruthlessly. Jesus was beaten mercilessly. Jesus was whipped until every inch of his body bled. Jesus was kicked. spit on. and humiliated. Finally he was crucified.Needless to say my wife and went home and I had the best sex of our life after later that night after the flick.The only thing I was disappointed with was that it wasn't Monica Bellucci who did the whipping."
4,"Do not understand the charges of anti-semitism leveled against this film. In my lifetime I've seen this story filmed countless times. From the 1961 KING OF KINGS to George Steven's gargantuan THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD to THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW to JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR to Zefferelli's JESUS OF NAZARETH and Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST all telling the same story with the same cast of characters. While some of them created controversy over political or creative thinking. others generated criticism over casting choices. none of them had charges of anti-semitism hurled at them. All the good guys are Jews. all the bad guys are either Roman. Jewish high priests or non-believers. What made Mel Gibson's film so different? And why did so many people jump on the bandwagon? Except for the violence. Gibson doesn't do anything the other films didn't already do. So what lies behind all this?"
4,"This movie is supposed to be a real life depiction of Christ in his final hours. Mel Gibson seems determined to show the viewer just how much suffering Jesus went through.Mr. Gibson has stated that 'The Forces Of EVIL' were at work during the making of this movie and conspiring to stop him from making this piece of Christian Propaganda.Perhaps somebody should spend 30 million dollars of their OWN MONEY(!!!) and make a movie about The Inquistion or all of the so called Holy Wars where people were tortured and killed in the Name Of Jesus. Just a thought. No doubt movie producers will now cross the road when they see Mel coming and I would not at all be surprised if this movie spells the end for Mr. Gibson's acting career not that I think he cares about that.If you really want to see the results of over zealous Christian Devotion  then this movie is for you.I give ths movie 5 stars because I kind of like the scenery in it which looks pretty authentic."
4,"I have never been to a movie where no one got up to get refreshments and no one talked during the movie.  At the end everyone including me just sat there for a few minutes before getting up to leave.  This film was so real and so moving that I cried steadily from the very first time Jesus was struck in the Garden of Gethsemane until he died on the cross.  To think he went through such torture for us.  I especially felt for Mary who had to watch her son suffer and die and I can understand why she wanted to die with him.  Everyone should watch this movie."
4,"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this movie. as it is one of those movies that are well made. but simply unenjoyable. I say this because watching the torture of a righteous man. the son of God. is simply hard to see.As a movie. there isn't much to this. However. this is a historically accurate movie that portrays the death of Christ very accurately. as well as the suffering he went through. Much of it is horrific and hard to watch. thus the 'R' rating.I strongly discourage younger viewers from seeing this movie. If you're looking for enjoyment. don't watch this either. I do recommend everyone watching this at least once though. simply to understand it's content and what Christians believe."
4,"Shiva Damienson has got it all wrong.  Every other movie about the New Testamont has been inacurate in their dipiction of Christ's crusifixtion.  If you've seen movies like Jesus of Nazereth and others from that era. than your eyes will be opened when you see this film.  If you consider the film to be overly violent than stay away from it. even if you are a Christian like me.  I am a Christian and was disturbed by the violence. but that was because it was commited against my savior: an inoccent man.  The movie is rated R for a reason. so this movie is not appropriate for a younger audience. but for anyone who has the stomach to handle it. than see it."
4,"This is not a DVD. this is a world-wide experience. Everytime I watch this DVD. I realize exactly what Jesus did to save me and.as painful and hard as it is to watch. I love HIM even more. It's not for the faint of heart. it's not the traditional family movie. It is however a very essential DVD to receive as your own personal copy because it teaches you things through words and actions no other movie can teach you. I hope all who gets it appreciated all the effort taken to keeping it authentic in language. events and the message being told. Contrary to what happened to the director. this is his finest work. A masterpiece and a classic."
4,"Nice artistic rendering of the last days of Christ. Not really violent. but it had a taste of old horror films like RoseMary's Baby and The Omen. in the scene of the Devil? with a devil's baby? and also scenes of children turning into devil's faces. that to me was the scariest part. Violence? not really nothing horrendous like most movies out today. no real violence in this. Movie done artistically. and apparently Gibson has a real belief. because of the ruining of the Jewish Temple at the end of the movie makes sure of that. Other than that. you are not sure whether Jesus is a criminal or truly the son of God. All in all not a bad movie. If I sit through it enthralled. then ok. its a 4 or 5 rating. In this case a 4 rating. because there may be some racist attitudes towards Jews slightly in this movie. but all in all good well done watchable movie."
4,"Of course it is! it's the story of the son of God. so obviously it's not for little kiddies.people into heavy metal and rap or Executive producers. The story was good. although. I did feel Gibson did exploit the religious congregation a bit. just to make a lot of money (unexpectedly?); which just means. he's a normal Catholic man - just kidding dude. I liked the film. It was brutally honest - and if you're going by the bible. historically accurate. I much point out. that the whole story is in Hebrew. so if you're going to watch it. get the bifocals out to see the subtitles!"
4,"I held off watching this movie because I had heard so much about the blood and gore. But I knew that I would eventually see it. I embrace the story of Christ and the power of his teachings. Though this film contains only a few scenes of his life and ministry. the depiction of torture and the crucifixion aptly conveys a message of love - that is. what Christ was willing to suffer for all mankind. The imagery of the devil was well-placed. And. to me at least. the story moved at a good pace - not too fast. not too slow. Moreover. James Caviezel's performance was outstanding. However. I was not moved emotionally (or. spiritually) the way I had anticipated. Perhaps it was the hype. But I'm glad that it got so much (well-deserved) attention."
4,"I don't really want to talk about the religious aspect that everyone is arguing about... I just think that this is a great movie. It is done very well and looks stunning. The acting was great. It is a violent movie and I don't think anyone knows for sure if Jesus' death was that violent... in fact I don't think anyone knows for sure if God even exists (that's why they call it faith right?) People who say they are 100% certain that God exists are always whack jobs. People who say they are 100% sure that God doesn't exist are just as whacky. But one thing is certain. this is a very entertaining film that is done well and really should be considered one of the best movies of all time."
4,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend in the theaters as soon as it came out.  This is not really a very religious movie. but rather describes the last 12 hours of Jesus before he was crucified.  The content of the movie is very strong though.  Throughout the whole movie. I was bothered by how many times Christ was punished...was just in about every other scene!  I think. that the director(s) abused a little of the punishment. but that's my opinion.  We didn't get to live those times to find out how it really was. but it was very hard. lots of punishment and suffering.It shows clearly all the suffering Jesus went through. and how he stayed strong the whole way.  Like another reviewer mentioned. the Satan character and deamons that haunt Judas were well done.Overall. the movie is very good. with lots of strong & violent scenes and sad moments as well. Go watch it and/or buy it and renew your faith!"
4,"This movie is more like a propaganda film. None of us will ever know for sure about the historical Jesus. since he lives more in myths and beliefs than in historical chronicle. How did Mr Gibson know about the level of cruelty shown? Moreover. Jesus was depicted more like the conventional iconography--caucasian male with a beard and long hair. How did a hard working carpenter look in 2000 yrs old Middle East? Certainly not like the one shown.However. this movie did one good thing for me: reminded me about the necessity to cultivate compassion for fellow human beings. On the other hand. for the simple-minded. literal believer. this movie will generate hate. vengeance. and totally undeserving surge of emotion.From that standpoint. I must say. this movie fell short as a visual art.Watch it. but please 'watch out' about what you feel."
4,"The movie is very vivid and emotional. I don't like to watch violence. but I think in this case it shows exactly what our Savior went through so that we can have salvation. It adds meaning to it. It's very difficult to watch because of how awful they were to Him. but it depicts the love of God for us. thus strengthening our love for Him. He made that ultimate sacrifice for us. so now it's our turn to make our sacrifices for Him. even unto death."
4,"I have to admit. I cried in the movie theater. at least twice. The guy next to my boyfriend wept like a repenting sinner. people cleared their noses and throats. They clasped their mouths.The brutal portrayal of Jesus's last 12 hours were gory. unhuman. bloody. tragic. and filled me with sorrow and love for him.It was an amazing movie. and the cast was perfect for it. A must see for anyone appreciating the deep topics.I think in a funny way. this hollywood production made me feel closer to God. it did not make me think any less of Jewish people. and it made me cry deeply when I got home. to let those emotions that I bottled up during the showtime. free.Go see it. I think everyone should."
4,"I can understand Gibson wanting to do something different but I wasn't crazy about the final product. The sets. the actors. and the music were all beautiful & amazing & artistic. I even loved that it was done in the ancient languages. What I didn't like was that Jesus' message was not even included in this film. It seemed to be all about the crucifixion which made it a rather joyless. excruciating viewing experience. I wish the film had been mainly about the message of Christ. because I feel the artistry and beauty of the film will be wasted because so many people will only want to watch this film once."
4,"We all know the story of Jesus Christ. He lived as a human and committed no sin. He was the perfect man. Because of this he was able to settle the debt we have built with our sins buy acting as a human sacrifice. This movie gives us a look at how his final hours may have transpired. It's very powerful and very upsetting.This is an incredible movie. It is passionate. as the title suggests. and very realistic. The acting is perfect and the message is timeless. Whether you believe that Jesus was the son of God or not. you can appreciate the passion and love he had for his fellow man. It's amazing to think that he endured what he did as a human. when he also possessed the power of God. If you can handle the brutality and emotional toll this film will take on you. I strongly recommend it. Be ye warned! It's extremely graphic and hard not to look away from at times."
4,"People who don't like it because of the gore. Let me tell you something. The gore scenes in this film are extremley grade school compared to the way it really happened. There has never been or ever will be a civilization as decadent and barbaric as the roman empire. They were masters of torture and what the Jesus Christ suffered in this film was nothing even close to what the real Jesus Christ endured for us so we wouldn't have to go to Hell. The Non Christian who watches this film can not truly appreciate the love Jesus had for us going to the cross like the Christian can. Watch it not the gore scenes. You want to see gore watch Dawn Of The Dead or The Burning Moon. You want a true love story watch this film."
4,"This film leaves so much to be desired by the time the closing credits roll. you wonder why you sat through it in the first place. It appears to have absolutely no purpose... just meanders along violently... never giving... and there are few stories whether true or fictional that are better more exciting fare for good film-making than this -- so the plot was thick and ripe for an amazing movie experience... but they just didnt pull it off unfortunately. If you love the Jesus story you will be sadly dissappointed by this strange twisted desultory mess of a film."
4,"Outstanding. Not only did Mel Gibson show the suffering that Jesus endured on his final hours of life. but the compassion and loving kindness he has for all mankind.When I went to see this film. which was on the very first release day. when the film ended not one person left the cinema. We all sat there and watched as the credits and music played. I am not sure why we did this. Maybe we saw what life is truly about. and we didn't want it to end there. Or maybe we were shocked that this happened. and we have taken it for granted for all these years.What I do know is that this film is outstanding. It is the best film I have ever seen. because it impacted me in such a positive and good way. Highly recommended."
4,"i may be a metalhead. but i know that Jesus died for my sins and He comes first in my life before any metal band does. this movie is awesome. but there are a few things that don't happen in the Holy Bible. like satan carrying around a baby. Judas Iscariot being tormented by a bunch of kids.and one of the criminals getting pecked in the head by a crow. if this movie moved you to accept Jesus as your Savior. remember these three things: Jesus died. Jesus rose. and Jesus is coming again."
4,"Mel Gibson's film of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus focuses on his torture and crucifixion.  There is little dialogue. and it mostly consists of passages from the Bible.  The spoken Aramaic and English subtitles were not distracting. as the story is so familiar.  The brutality is unrelenting. but it was realistic.This movie is not for everyone.  It is not 'entertaining.'  Those who liked the old movies 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' and 'King of Kings'  will not be surprised by anything here (only the degree to which the torture is shown). because it is the same story.  It is an intimate. in-your-face. almost real-time reenactment of the crucifixion.  Due to the very personal and intense reaction people have to the movie. I think it would have been better shown in churches than in the theatre."
4,"Very important to see so to understand more deeply the oblation of Our Lord on good friday and it's beginning at the last supper. This film is a terrific meditation primer for the sorrowful mysteries of the rosary. the stations of the cross. and the sorrows of our lady. It is something amazing which has been given to the church and to all souls as a gift. to know Jesus better and that He loves us most piercingly.When this film came to the prisons there were many conversions. This shows us that God's work can be in the media and that we should pray for more of that work to be done."

4,"If you enjoyed Stanley Kubrick's ClockWork Orange. you'll like this film. It was nothing more than a long winded film of the good old 'Ultra Violence'. Yes. it was anti-Semitic. or biblically accurate whatever suits your religion. whether you're a Jew or a Christian or if you're into that sort of thing. I viewed the movie for its face value which was nothing more than a mere long video of Jesus getting his A** kicked. which was not only unrealistic because the frail actor that they chose for the movie would have collapsed within the first thirty minutes of the brutal beating he was receiving. The most interesting character in the film was Satan who was portrayed by Rosalinda Celentano who just kept lurking around in the background with those eerie androgynous looks. However with all the hype about this movie. it is a must see. and that's why I waited until it was in the video stores because I already knew what to expect."
4,"I just saw this movie with one of my younger sisters for Easter. and we were both very moved by it. It is definitely a realistic portrayl of what Jesus had to go through for us. Watching this movie. in a way. has brought me closer to Jesus. and it really left an impact on me. It's a very heavy movie. however. and very difficult to watch. I don't like to see people getting hurt. so seeing Jesus get hurt was especially hard for me. But it really shows you how much Jesus loves and cares for us all by taking the burden of sin for us. I think this is a movie everyone should see because it is a real reminder of the wonderful love Jesus has for all of us. The movie was all in Hebrew. too. with subtitles. so it was very realistic and quite faithful to the Gospels. Mel Geibson did a wonderful job sharing with us a very realistic glimpse of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus."
4,"Dr. Satan. you seem to think you know Mel's motivations. I think you're speaking through your jaded perceptions. When Mel started work on this film. he ponied up his own money. He didn't even have a distributor for the film. but he went on with the production. He filmed a movie in two dead languages. He has spent another $10 million of his own money to build a church building in his hometown. His actions show him to be a devout man.If he were only concerned with profit he could have churned out another Lethal Weapon movie. His films and him personally have already made a mint.I saw The Last Temptation of Christ. aside from the final sequence when He comes off of the cross. the movie not very risky."
4,"In the film Gibson adds the scene where Christ tells his Apostles 'There is no greater love than to give one's life'. Now that I'm an adult. if I could watch how much my own parents have endured with unselfish sacrifice. sleep deprivation. worry. and suffering to raise me in the best unselfish way they could to make me a better person. I guarantee you. I would be thankful. In fact any child would want to run to their loving parents with a tearful embrace asking their forgiveness in taking them for granted. To watch what another endured for me inspires me to be unselfish in raising my own children and in going out of the way for others without complaint. This is the essence of Christianity and this is the message The Passion delivers."
4,"Although I will never watch it again. I was glad that I went to see this powerful movie.  It accurately portrays Jesus' last tortured hours on planet earth.  I give kudos to Gibson. who was brave enough to finance this movie himself. amidst much controversy.  I would encourage all to watch this movie. at least one time. to understand why throughout the ages. thousands have been willing to die for their belief in a man called Jesus Christ.Yes. this movie is violent. but this world is violent. and Jesus did not come to escape the realities of this world. but to share in our sufferings."
4,"I am not a 'religious' person. however. I felt it was important to see this movie.  If nothing else. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.After sitting through a very quiet showing. my wife and I got up and walked out without saying a word.  It took a while for the movie to sink in.  Nobody was talking as they left the theatre.It was a moving experience.  Graphic and disturbing.  Something I am glad that I sat through. but can't see adding this to my movie collection.More interesting than the movie itself. is the reaction of those who liked or disliked it.  Reading the reviews of this movie is a great way to see the cultural divide in our country."
4,"Of all the movies i've seen about the crucifixion and resurrection of the Christ. this movie has the most accurate portrayal as I've seen so far even though in the bible Jesus had suffered a far more gruesome beatings than what was shown in film but it's as close as it gets. The movie also has the characters speaking in hebrew instead of english unlike other films about the crucifixion. However I suggest that people watch this film with caution. it shows alot of graphic stuff including blood and it's definately not for younger children.  It's a great film overall."
4,"Master.Things are going very smoothly. Undoubtedly.Emmerich's pervasive presence has allowed meto persevere on the set; it's the same spiritualforce I believe that will catapult this film to thetop of the box office. In my ponderings. I can'thelp but wonder if these same forces are what aidedher in her levitating and astral projecting. Itake devilsh delight in believing so.If you would kindly send me another copy of 'TheDolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ' I wouldbe indebted to you. Unfortunately. my copy wascovered in blood. It seems to be everywhere. I justcan't help myself sometimes. And I can't help butfeel wholly nostalgic as I'm transported back tothe blood-drenched fields of Scotland and SC.The Director"
4,"'The Passion Of The Christ' is a towering example of what motion pictures can be. It takes the 2000-year-old gospel narratives and brings them to life in a way that is shocking in its realism and power.Mel Gibson has been true to his intention: to make a movie that will stand the test of time. one that can reinvigorate the faith of some and perhaps cause others to find theirs.The acting. cinemetography. and score are all Oscar-caliber. The special effects bring the Passion of Jesus to life. so real they enduce cringes and outpourings of sympathy. Jim Caviezel should have been nominated for the Academy Award for his protrayal of the Son of God.This is a movie that everyone should see. and any practicing Christian will want to own. Five stars!"
4,"This movie sets a new standard for subsequent Jesus films. I must confess that I was disposed to 'like' the film no matter what. but having seen it. I find it truly remarkable. It was not entertaining... It is a film for reflection. Gibson captures perfectly the sentiment that the 'Christ should suffer and die' (the Gospel according to Luke). And for who? All of us. One cannot expect to appreciate this movie if all one wants is a good flick. This film challenges Christians and non-Christians alike to reflect on the sufferings of Christ.As an aside. I would not take small children to this film (in fact. the crucifixion scenes in most films are too much for small children). And I would recommend that viewers read one of the gospels. if not all of the gospels. before viewing it. As it covers the last 12 hours of Christ's life. much can be gained from a close reading of the biblical texts."
4,"I have many blu-ray's and was excited when i saw that The Passion was finally coming to blu-ray! I was not disappointed. although it looks mildly different. you can see every nook and cranny. It looks amazing. It is a little grainy at times. but it doesn't steal the show like other blu-ray titles i have! I would definitely recommend this title to any one wanting to see a great movie on their big screen tv's. Definately don't pass this up!"
4,"So many reviews are expressions of one's beliefs that they fail to pay tribute to James Caviezel. a young man whose faith and strength of character is reflected in the depth of this role.  Every actor searches for a role that will define his skills and be a part of his being.  The role of Jesus will be such a role for James Caviezel. This is a movie that causes us to look at the history of the time and how politics. greed. and fear combine to create suffering for an innocent Jesus.  Whether one is a believer or not. one has to look at the screen as a canvas where Mel Gibson as an artist uses Caviezel as his instrument to create a masterpiece.  It causes one to be humble in the presence of such power and glory.  Thank You Mel and Thank You James for sharing your commitment and passion with the world. You said to the world 'the battle of good versus evil is still the same'---here it is ---this hasn't changed in over two thousand years."
4,"'...'The Passion of the Christ' has caused plenty of controversy. just like the ministry of Christ did and still continues to do to this day. When a faith-oriented film has such an emotional impact on so many lives and creates so much discussion between millions of people with different religious backgrounds. you know a must-see feature has been made.' -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder'It's the same story the Bible's been telling us for years. but Mel Gibson did a truly awesome job of bringing it to people in such a real way.' -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films. check out cruciflicks.net where 'We don't judge people. just the movies they make.'"
4,"No word can accurately describe this epoc produced by Mel Gibson.  This is the first time any movie production has made an effort to depict the true gruesomeness and agony that Christ suffered on that last day.  Yes. this makes for an incredibly gory film. yet at the same time. the gore isn't for the sake of gross. it is to try to be true to the very real event in history.For the believer - it should be impossible to sit through it without being totally and completely overwhelmed by Christ's suffering.  If you have a dry eye after watching this - you need to re-evaluate your relationship with Christ.For the unbeliever - THIS is how much God loves you - that he gave his only Son to pay such a horrible price that you could not possibly pay yourself - for your sin.Watch this movie.  It will change how you look at Jesus Christ."
4,"I don't speak ancient aramaic. and I'm probably being uncool to admit that I hate to read subtitles.  But my problem with this film is the violence.  I think it's way too much. and really bruises the viewers unneccessarily.  I understand that part of the Christian experience is to understand the sacrifice and pain. but I felt like I was watching a Tobe Hooper Chainsaw massacre at times.  For the violence. I give the film 1-star and WARN PARENTS before scarring their children.  For Gibson's good intentions. I give the film 5-stars.  It averages to 3 stars."
4,"Excellent film has many gripping and brilliantly realized scenes throughout.  I am sure many people are going to be divided about this film although I do not believe that it is anti-semitic in the slightest.  It will be very violent to some.  I thought that Gibson directed the film amazingly.  The acting by Jim Caviezel is astonishing.  Well shot cinematography and musical score.  But I can't say that it is the best religious film I have ever seen.  That title still belongs to 'Ben Hur'."
4,"Beautifully acted and filmed (by the son of noted Holocaust denier Hutton Gibson). obviously made with 'passion' for the (literal and figurative) self-flagellation crowd. After the poor guy gets the lash for the 114th time (yeah. I know it's only 39; it just seemed like 114). with all that red-dyed corn syrup splattering all over the place. it just starts to get a little silly. kind of like the flying entrails in ANDY WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN. Capital punishment is. of course. not very funny. especially when the punishment is Death By Torture. so I did my best not to laugh.If Evangelicals. Opus Dei Catholics. sadists and other moonbats want to go all swooney over this sort of thing. they are most welcome to. To the curious. but more sqeamish. of my fellow nonbelievers. I would not suggest watching this after a heavy meal. If you must do so. keep a bucket handy."
4,"As everyone knows. Mel Gibson's film focuses on the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus.  From the Garden of Gethsemenie to turture to crucifixion to resurrection. Mel Gibson's movie is a emotional journey through the heart of Christian belief.  Is it bloody?  Yes.  Is it violent?  Yes.  Does that diminish its value?  Not in the least.  This movie is an unflinching view of Jesus' final hours that is powerful and moving.  mes Caviezel. Maia Morgenstern. and Monica Bellucci give stunning performances as Jesus. Mary. and Mary Magdeline respectively.  The emotions that they convey on their faces is heartbeaking.  As for the anti-Semitism. I did not see any.  I think that you will see what you want to see in this regard. although I do not believe contains any anti-Semitic views.  I recommend that everyone (Christian or not) take in a viewing of this amazing film."
4,"This movie takes the rather sanitized version of Jesus' crucificion and brings home the fact that the reality was far more brutal than any of us could imagine. Understanding what Jesus endured so that the rest of us could be saved is by far the most important aspect of christianity. People who just don't 'get' this movie are people who have no belief in the christian faith - I am not criticizing them. I am just suggesting that they may not truly understand the impact of this movie.There has been alot of criticism levelled that this movie is anti-semetic. It is not. It is telling the story as it was. If someone walks away from this movie with anger. then they have obviously not understood the message."
4,"any film that deals with Jesus is bound to stir up some kind of controversy and this film had alot of people split. the depictions and the Blood and intensity kept you on the edge.  the film was captivating in the directing and overall story telling and the various perspectives that capture your mind set upon digesting all that is taken place.  I found the pacing of this film to be very incredible and it just moved me. the Cross scene and the nailing parts were deep and very Profound. the film is two hours and i felt it flew by. it asnwered alot of questions and also made you see things in a completely different light. very Powerful and a very Good film."
4,"I sat in a sold out theater in complete silence along with everyone else. I don't see how anyone can enjoy this film of suffering. but you can learn from it and appreciate this sacrifice shown in brutal detail. Jim Caviezel beautifully played Christ. and I really felt his suffering jump off the screen as if my own soul was being tortured. The film was much more violently graphic and gory than even I suspected. and I have seen almost every splatter horror film ever made (Dead Alive anyone?). But the real diffrence is that 'The Passion of the Christ' has an emotional impact that goes hand in hand with the violence portrayed. This really happened and the violence was extreme. probably more so than the movie even shows. Thanks Mel Gibson for making a film that shows the ultimate Passion of the Christ as close as possibe to the true suffering."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
4,"The movie is punctuated by unfortunate series of continuous beating. Any human being with massive strength would not have been able to sustain such number of flagellations using whips with pointed hooks and nails.The holy Bible does NOT refer to the degree of such ill-treatments. for example the 'scene' when the Cross was 'trundled' on the hill and fell on the dusty ground. with Christ face down.Even the 'abduction' of Christ was transformed into a frenzied activity with exaggerations when they hit Him repeatedly so as to inflict pain until He fell over the road side. chained.We know the Camera can do marvels. but behind it there ought to be reasonable interpretation of events that should take precedence over smart technology."
4,"Wow. I saw this when it came out and wasn't really affected.  I thought of it as a horror movie with a lot of suffering.  Now that I saw it again and have accepted Jesus as my savior I feel differently about this movie.  Its beautifully done and captures what Jesus could of gone through to be our savior.It illustrates very clearly Biblical scripture into the movie.  You have to be moved to see this if not the first time. then the second.  Jesus suffered for our sins.  Through him we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews murdered him and thats why they don't want to accept Jesus as the savior.The Jews were the chosen. BEFORE Jesus came into their life.  Now. if they accept Christ. they will also be redeemed.This movie is powerful and please see it with an open mind.  You will be moved."
4,"Though I may rate it as a 5 star movie. but the truth is that it is unrateable. There are scences which were full of violence and sadistic environment. and there are scences of great pain and emotions flowing. but this does make a difference in making the movie captivating. Personally. I have seen what Chrsit has achieved being a Man and after the resurrection as God. This movie will make you cry even if you are a Believer or not.The very touching scenes of the movie was pain of Mary. Mother of Christ.As far as the flogging scene is concerned. it wasn'st very gross. Even though I have seen many violent movies I couldnt tolerate the flogging of Christ because of the sadistic way the Roman soldiers were torturing Him.The fiction of having Satan (sometimes a man or a woman) around was quite good.I would recommend this movie to everyone. if you are Christian or not. This movie will grow on you very quickly."
4,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me. it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal. poignant. moving. and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion. my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
4,"Honestly to say the least i thought this movie was going to be an ok movie. something to watch when it comes out on dvd or cable. but my cousins had invited me to the movies. who were going to pay for me so i went. this movie was so emotional. anyone who doesnt feel any emotion to this movie. is absolutely heartless. i recommend seeing. but not constantly. maybe once in a long while. its not a movie to keep watching over and over but a good movie to own. I without a doubt give this movie 5 stars. Great job Mr. Gibson on a directorial accomplishment."
4,"I can't understand how people can see this as a recruiting film for churches. Frankly. I worry about people who liked this having custody of children or pets. If anything. it made me want to avoid churchgoers as I avoid Nazis and Klansmen. If I were a Martian arriving on earth and this was shown to me to explain this major religion. I would recommend having the earth vaporized before this dangerous insanity spread. Jesus said some admirable things about mercy and forgiveness. but you won't find them in this sick piece of trash."
4,"I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD.  I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now.  Watch the movie if you have not seen it.  Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins .... when He was innocent of all sins.  Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind. All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul. He made that possible for us by taking on our sins.  Watch the movie.  Please !"
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
4,"I don't see Christ but brutal violence. This seems a documentary film to me. Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways. finally died. Yes. you will see how Jesus suffered and died. vividly to your eyes. Period. The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however. quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle. Do not expect any delete scenes. extra features. casting. or director's commentary. Nothing. Period.Be honest. say if the man in the film is not Jesus. would you rate it the same? If not. because he's not Jesus? Hmm......*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for The Passion of the Christ ***1. Film Rewatchability: LOW2. DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT4. Sound Quality: EXCELLENT(Reviewed by Otto Yuen. 1-Oct-2004)"
4,"That is right. God bless Mel for making one of the most loved and profound depiction of Jesus' crucifixion.Let's face it. there were people in this country who've had it in for Mel sice production on this film began years back. When the worst they predicted failed to materialize they looked like the alarmist fools they are. Mel's tirades just gave them any excuse they needed to attack him all over again.Where is the condemnation for Gary Busey and Billy Zane for starring in an outright antisemitic movie depicting Jewish doctors as ghouls lusting for the body organs of Arabs?Where was the outrage for Marlon Brando when he called Jews 'kikes' right on the Larry King Show?Or what about Russell Crowe who not only once referred to the Maoris of New Zealand as 'niggers' but hit somebody with a telephone?Mel did a really stupid. horrible thing with what he said.But you know what? Suck it up. Accept the asology and let the man get on with his life and the great flicks he makes."
4,"This is the most accurate and inspiring of the Passion Plays ever done on film.Those who find it alarmingly brutal miss the fact that the Crucifixion of Christ was beyond brutal.Without the suffering of Jesus. the Christian religion is pointless.I cannot watch this film very frequently. but I well remember the first time it was screened in Houston on Ash Wednesday.The Catholics. with ashes on their foreheads. quietly watched. The Evangelicals came to their seats with big boxes of popcorn. which they dropped on the floor as they witnessed the horror of the performance. Christianity is not a saccharinesque religion.. Many people learned this for the first time as they watched The Passion of the Christ."
4,"Who is the real Mel Gibson? A devout Catholic full of love. or an entertainer addicted to gore. blood. torture and violence. not only in this movie. but throughout his whole career?Well. it's up to you to decide. Unfortunately. he chose to display violence once more. this time centering his blood-lust around the Christ. to a point that. around the middle of the movie. some viewers were already num to the violence being shown on the screen. in such a way that whatever message this director was trying to pass was lost.It's a shame that such a budget by such a famous actor / director was wasted in telling one of the most important and beautiful stories of the world in this fashion..."
4,"haha  a horror movie?  hmm perhaps.the funny thing is. according to your bible. that's HOW IT HAPPEND.the fact is. no one should be getting offended by this movie.  wah wah it's too violent.  fine. then don't watch.  just because it's about jesus doesn't mean you hafta pay for a ticket.  the advertising for this movie is insane. so don't tell me you didn't KNOW it was going to be violent.  and if you wanted a non-violent movie. maybe you should go watch a comedy.  not a movie about jesus being HUNG ON A CROSS. STABBED. AND BEATEN.  guess what?  according to that book you believe. THAT'S WHAT HAPPEND TO HIM.  did you want Mel Gibson to put up a fake portrayal of what happend????oh. yeah.  and the movie was really good.  i don't even believe this stuff. but it was very emotional. and worth seeing."
4,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly. I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal. some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church. some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes. it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives."
4,"I am not a 'true believer' and went to see the film out of curiosity.  Technically speaking it was a well-filmed and acted movie.  The fact that the dialog was in Aramaic and Latin gave the film historical atmosphere.  Having been exposed to the story of Jesus Christ as a child I did not find the story hard to follow.  However. I'd imagine someone not fully knowledgeable of the death of Jesus could take the Passion out of context.I would not rate the movie as entertaining or informative. The scenes of Jesus' torture and crucifixion I did not think were as macabre as many critics claimed it to be.  (Apparently. the critics have not watched any slasher films in the past 20 years!)It was without a doubt a testament to Mel Gibson's faith and I am sure the faithful were as equally moved. Still it was a good movie and I would recommend the faithful or the open-minded film goer to see it."
4,"This is a religion that never helped its adherents to be moral. No wonder they have done these.- Inquisition in Spain and Goa- Crusades- Ethnic cleansing of American Indians- SIavery- Lynchings- The Anti Chinese league of the Americas- Jim Crowe- The HoIocaust. Read the antisemitic rantings of Martin Luther the founder of the Protestant movement that was the impetus for the Holocaust.- Separate churches for blacks and whites in the bible belt.- BIood Iibel. Read in Wikipedia about this.. OMG! What eviI!In today's world the vast majority of so the called christians are fortunately social christians (church for weddings and funerals only). These social christians use their own moral compass and reject all the vile doctrine of this godforsaken religion called christianity."
4,"I cannot comment on the other languages. but the Latin pronunciation used is not the classical Latin pronunication probably in use at that time.  It is a later pronunciation widely used by the Roman Catholic Church and characteristic of versions of Latin that became the Romance languages.Although this is a remarkable dramatic work. even believers may need to be reminded that it is still merely a movie. representing or dramatizing. but of course not recording. real events. including Jesus' resurrection. just as a movie about. say. Lincoln's assassination would depict. but cannot actually record. real events of 1865.  Dramatic representations of the Passion are so commonplace that one would easily feel encouraged to think of it as myth and to forget that it all actually happened. in just one way. as real events do happen.  No photographs survive. not because there was no scene to be photographed. but because photography came along some 1830 years later.  However obvious this may be. I fear that it needs to be said."
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
4,"The visuals are certainly difficult to take in their entirety; whether necessary depends on the viewer. Mel Gibson's point in the film's graphic depiction was to show that Jesus did not simply live and then die. Yes. this seemingly accurate portrayal is quite narrow in scope but the viewer must admit that by the film credits. or even if they are able to see it. The Passion has delivered it's message. Also. Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern deserves an Oscar as Jesus' devotional mother while she holds every ounce of pain and suffering any human soul could bear in her facial expressions.One relevant footnote which occurred in filming the lashing scenes: Jim Caviezel states he nearly passed out when only one of the strands of the whips accidently caught him on unprotected skin."
4,"Lets face it the film is a gore fest. but i have seen worse and the only true gruesome scenes is when Jesus was whipped. he faced so much and agony by Romans and civilians in those days. Even if they say the Jews killed Jesus. it should refer to the Jews two thousand years ago. not the Jews living now. The film dipicts the Devil the best i have ever seen. The evil the devil presents show why he is the true enemy in this picture. Jesus may have suffered but he wins and in a way defeats Satan. Even if your not catholic you can still watch this film. the gore is the only aspect that makes it rated R. Yet i was dissapointed with the ending becuase it was too quick with the resurrection."
4,"IF I EVER RAN INTO MEL GIBSON SOMEDAY. I'D HUG HIM WITH ALL MY MIGHT! NEVER HAS A MOVIE TOUCHED ME SO MUCH AS 'THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST' I HAVE BEEN DEVOUTLY RELIGIOUS EVER SINCE I WAS NINE YEARS OLD. I KNEW WHAT I WAS IN FOR WHEN I WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE. AND YET I WAS STILL CRYING AND SHAKING FOR THE TORTURE THAT JESUS WENT THROUGH. HE WAS HANDS DOWN THE MOST UNSELFISH AND LOVING PERSON TO EVER GRACE THIS PLANET. I HOPE THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WATCHES THIS MOVIE. AND I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY. WE ALL LIVE BY WHAT GOD WANTS."
4,"First off. not ALL of this movie made sense to me. I don't know really what to say here because everyone else has already said everything. Some of the beginning made a little sense because I have seen 'Life Of Brian' which is the exact opposite of this film. So I might have learned some things already. I do have many questions about it. though. I get why so many people were offended. Because Jesus sinned in some way. Throughout the movie. he kept praying that he. along with a few other folks would be forgiven. but THAT'S where I get confused. Oh well. I'm surprised I did understand SOME things. and yet. it's very interesting."
4,"There is one incredible scene in this movie - a scene that perhaps makes the entire movie worth the price.  It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother.  In that scene one can see a Jesus of love. humanity. and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name.  It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful.  It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make.  Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations. essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity."
4,"I think people are just shock to see somebody playing Jesus Christ in a R rated movie that's why all the controversy cause theirs lots of other different videos out their having Jesus in it this one is just the first to be rated R. The reason for that is it has to be more realistic thats the whole point of doing a great movie and besides all of this realy happen to him years ago. What was a disapointment. Mel Gibson didn't even get nominated for an Oscar for best director let alone win one that is a big disgrace. well who needs a stinking Oscar at least he won a 'People's Choice Award' cause it all about what people want."
4,"After all of the thousands of words. arguments and heated passions that this movie has inspired since long before its release. it is a real downer to find out. upon viewing it. that it is a crummy movie.  The subject matter -- the final suffering and crucifixion of Jesus Christ -- could not be more compelling. even for non-believers.  But somehow Mel Gibson has managed to squeeze so much slow-motion blood out of the proceedings. without giving us any context for the character of the actual man. that the story is oddly passionless.  And talk about over the top!  The beatings. mutilations. and general bloodletting are so graphic that they teeter on snuff -- match this with the ridiculous horror-movie images of a slithery he-she as Satan. and you've got what could best be described as a gore-fest.  Yuck.  The two stars are for Jim C.. who suffers nobly in a very realistic prosthetic nose. and the cinematography. which is at times lovely."
4,"Having been forewarned by reviewers and friends that saw this movie in theaters I was prepared for a very bloody and a very very violent film. Since I really didn't need one and a half hours of splattering blood I waited to see this film 'when it came out on DVD' .....Yes the film was violent. but certainly not gratuitous ... Unlike Schindlers List where the director filmed in black and white to dull the graphic vilence of that film. I didn't get the feeling that 'The Passion' went over the top .....Not being a biblical scholar I was taken back to remember passages of the bible and the film pretty much depicts what I remember being taught when young.A point of aggravation with this DVD however was the subtitles which had a tendency of disappearing causing me to stop the film on several occasions to reactivate the subtitles ...Certainly a better DVD than I had expected ... Bravo Mel Gibson !"
4,"This movie is very very cool.  I for one will be honest and say I dont like to go to church. and im really not into anything spirtual. but I HAD to see this movie.  This movie is one of the few movies that I was about ready to cry watching it.  Mel Gibson did a very fine job showing what Jesus did for his people.  This movie actuly scared me in some scenes which added to its value.  This is one of the few films also that when I got up to leave the theater. I look around and half the audience is still sitting in there seats. looking blankly at the screen.  Props to James Caviezel for his outstanding portral as Jesus.  He did an unbeleavable job for that kind of demanding role.  Well worth the price of admition and dvd."
4,"if it wasn't as long. tedious. or overly violent.  Look at the Bible films that were done in the past.  They weren't a bloodbath. yet kept you enthralled with good pacing and editing.  Those films were perfectly adequate and conveyed the message of Jeseus.The Passion. however. hardly said anything of his life or teachings; they assumed that you knew all about him. and just focused on depicting his death.  So if anyone wants to watch Christ get whipped senseless. scouged 100 times. and beaten to a bloody pulp. see this movie right away."
4,"Not Just because it was one of the first movies out in 2004. but also because it is really good.  Jim Caviezal gives a great performance and should definetly be nominated.  The story here is not a bible fairy tale. its a story about jesus's personal suffering. its definetly not antisemtised. its not about that. and who really cares. its about what jesus did for everyone.  Its violent but when you hit someone with broken glass and nail him to a cross what do you think is gonna happen.  Its intense and dramtic. everyone in the theater cried.  See this movie it will make you think."
4,"A brutal portrayal of the death of Jesus. Very violent and graphic. There was not much to this except someone getting beaten. and beaten. and whipped. and whipped with razor-tipped whips. then beaten and whipped again. Then he musters up the energy to carry a cross and then gets nailed to it.The guy who played Jesus did a fantastic character portrayal. He was in another movie I watched and of course I did not recognize him as the same actor in Passion.My major complaint lies in the fact that most of this movie is based on beatings and torture. Hostel is kindergarten compared to this! Maybe show a bit of what else Jesus did in his life."
4,"I would have liked to seen more to this movie other than just the beating. I also hate subtitles. I don't care if they were trying to make it accurate to the dialect. I don't like to go to a movie to pay to read. to me it defeats the purpose: i could read a book. Had lots of gore. for that I gave it an extra star. For the repetitive scenes over and over again. I subtracted several stars. You know what kills me. Conservatives and religious people bash violence in movies and video games. but it seems as if it is ok to put this stuff in as long as your talking about Christ. Hypocrisy = religion do as I say not as I do. right? and stay away from those alter boys!"
4,"That's the way I'm sure a lot of people are feeling tonight after watching this.  I'm outraged by the completely ignorant criticism that Mr. Gibson has had to endure regarding the making of this film.  It's history. folks; if you don't like it. that still won't change it.  This movie portrays the events as they happened & it was probably actually worse than this extremely brutal portrayal.  It will shock you. but it will let you see firsthand what the Lord went through to redeem us.  Fairy tale?!?  Who would make up a fairy tale like this?  James Caviezel is great as Christ!  The sets & attention to detail are wonderful & the use of Aramaic only lends to the authenticity of the film.  If this film doesn't move you. you have no heart!  God bless you all & remember how much he loves you (John 3:16)."
4,"This movie is not for the faint of heart.  However. any other film maker probably would have made this movie so unbelievable that viewers wouldn't know how vicious Christ's death was.  Mel Gibson lets us see exactly what it was like 2000 years ago in Israel.  No sugar coating or anything artificial.  Gibson doesn't hold back and leaves no stone unturned.  Gibson captures the essence of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for us all.  Not to be  preachy. but I hope those of you who watch this movie know about the life Jesus lived and appreciate his sacrifice for our sins.  This movie hits home and is clearly the best film of 2004."
4,"Oscar Wilde once wrote. 'Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new. complex. and vital.' 'The Passion of the Christ' is almost beyond criticism; it doesn't really matter whether I or anyone else liked it or not. but the division manifest amongst its critics tends to support Wilde's conjecture.  From an artistic point of view. the film is completely uncompromising: the acting is inspired. the cinematography is brilliant. and the music provides a strikingly appropriate accompaniment to the visual imagery. The film is filled with rich symbolism. moments of heartrending beauty. and of course. disturbingly graphic and brutal acts of violence. One watches this movie with a combination of wonder and disgust. It is certainly not enjoyable to watch. but. rather. quite painful. but the spiritual reward reaped is well worth the suffering required to attain it. Highly recommended viewing."
4,"This film was a bad film based soley on entertainment value.  I don't see the necessity in a gore fest where Jesus Christ is involved.  If there were any FIRST hand accounts of this brutality.  this film may have more substance.  Seems that Gibson has his own spirituality on his sleeve.  I don't think that creates art or has any entertainment value.  Certainly blood and unrelenting violence is NOT entertaining.  Nor does this film have ANY artistic value.  The dialect isn't presented well here either.  The Aramaic voice isn't given justice here.  given the horridly poor interpretation and it's presentation.  This film is trash.  Simply.  God bless."
4,"I was afraid when I saw this movie.  I was told it was just a bloody massecre and too focust on the death and not the reserection.  However when I saw this movie I wept.  Mel Gibson did a fantastic job with flash backs. acting. and the death.  I did not even notice the fact that it was in latin.  This movie made me happy in the whole scheme of things.  You need to go see this on a sunny and happy day so you wont be depressed.  Watching this movie did not even seem like a movie but a look in the past as if I literally traveled through time and saw this tragety.  The Passion of the Christ was too perfect and I will never see it again."
4,"I am not Christian. But I read bible many times and saw many movies to know the life of Jesus Christ. After thinking of Christ many times. his life and kindness influenced me a lot. Unknowingly I started keeping him in my heart always. He gives me peace. love and compassion. He shows the way of life to one and many.When I bought this DVD. I could not wait to reach home to see this outstanding breath taking depiction of the last part of his life. I loved the possible reality that has been shown and understood the human cruality/apathy very well even though I hated the strong violence in any form. But Jesus Christ's mission is truely accomplished and he is in hearts of the majority of the world. In my opinion. the life of Jesus Christ as depicted here makes more interesting and reaches more millions."
4,"I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it. thinking it was a film. not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals. you risk being burned at the stake. an act of love to purify your soul.This film.as a film. disregarding the topic. is a dog. A cheap 'B' grade. blood spurting. flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour. but won't bother."
4,"this is the type of movie I would definitly recommend it for first time viewer but on personal note I would also say I will never watch this again. the thing is despite its christ we are talking about. it is still very hard for me to looking at a man being tortured like a hanging lamb in the kitchen while is considering myself is being entained in a movie.. IT IS TOO GROSS! the fact is it goes beyond the line there are anything horible things you ve seen in movie theater. that's what credit this movie as one unforgettable one in history. By comparing this to Hannibal. Hann is barely just a little kid's nitemare. Every minute of this movie chanllenge your sense to tolerante the scale of brutality upon someone to a new level. I would say if your a believer it could work better since the man you looking at aint normal human to you after all. so its more relief since its a 'super being' is tortured but not human like you and me..."
4,"Passion of the Christ is Mel Gibson's crowning achievement. It is strictly from the biblical account but where the scriptures are silent. Gibson's imagination adds to the experience as it literally brings the viewer to the Garden of Gethsemane and walks us through passion of Jesus Christ. Using biblical languages adds to that experience all the more that even if we dont understand the language. we can still follow the story. We can see the close bond between Jesus and his mother. the struggle of faith of his apostles and we can even sense why it is many were opposed to the Christ. There is love and hatred. fear and faith and we are left an emotional wreck trying to contemplate this great mystery of faith."
4,"I have both version's of the Passion of the Christ. But the Definitive Edition is better because it take out a few scenes. One part that isn't in this edition is right before the flogging scene starts. the 2 guards that bark in each other's face isn't in this film. This movie is highly emotional because it's the truth about what really happened. If you're looking for answers in life then please watch this film and then turn your whole heart.life. and soul to JESUS CHRIST THE WAY. THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE (John 14:6). God bless to all who watch this film."
4,"Despite reading much criticism of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. I find the film to be a convincing re-creation of the world in which Jesus Christ lived and of the Roman oppressions that inspired Hebrew resistance and ultimately Christian resolve to re-create civilization using communitarian rather than totalitarian models.  Dialogue spoken in a language used by ancient inhabitants of the Middle East also lends the film verisimilitude.  Christian orthodoxy insists that acknowledging the miracle of Christ's Resurrection is crucial to Christian faith. but to ordinary Christians. contemplation of Christ's unjust execution motivates commitment to Christian congregational charity more strongly than any assertion or proof of Christ's divinity.  THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a fine contribution to a genre that dramatizes Christ's appeal to suffering peoples in many times and places."
4,"The Most conteversal film of the year is also one of the best. a brilliant but tragic film. I Still liked Braveheart better .but this is a triumph for Mel Gibson. I saw this movie in theaters and this is the first movie I've seen in another language and english subtitles. This film is one of highest grossing movies of the year. I recommend this movie. you might think it will be boring. so did I .but once I saw it really wasn't boring. If your into gripping epics. then this is a great one. If your only into happy feel good movies then of course ignore this one. If you liked Braveheart I say see this too. experience the Grace. the Power. the Passion of this gripping epic starring Jim Caviezel."
4,"Look I respect Mel Gibson and I think he's a great actor and has done some great films but this movie was just totally pointless and I frankly don't see the appeal. I don't at all think it's anti-semetic or too violent but to me it was just pointless and boring. I can't see how anyone would find this to be moving or inspiring. For one thing. all they focused on was the beating and crucifiction. They never focused on Jesus's life or his teachings. or accomplishments. I consider myself to be a Christian moderate and I don't believe in everything the church preaches but with all the hype around this film. I expected more. I frankly want to know what moved or inspired anyone here because this was nothing more but a two hour snuff film disguised as something with a spiritual message. I understand the point of showing the gory details to try to convince people to change thier lives but the fact that it's fake really takes away from the effect."
4,"The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray]This film (and particularly the extra disk) is very useful for those particular individuals of the Christian faith who were not given the opportunity to learn about the finer aspects of Christ's Passion. specifically the Stations of the Cross.  Having grown up in the Baptist Church. I was not taught about the Stations. but strict emphasis was given to why Christ gave himself for us.  Additionally. the second disk amplifies the finer aspects of crucifixion. shows where the Stations of the Cross supposedly were in Jerusalem. and Christ's suffering as depicted in the Arts.  It is for these reasons that I recommend this disk set.  Whether or not one accepts Mel Gibson's interpretation of the Passion of Christ is up to the individual and how/what he/she believes."
4,"I am giving this film an extra star (moving it up to 2) because of the fine production values and amazing gore effects.  This movie is great for people who loved the 'Saw' pictures. just for the agony and torture.But seriously. why is it that so few people object to the idea that extreme violence is sacred somehow?  We have been taught for centuries that there is something divine about violence. and that cruelty is something that God (or the Big Whatever) needs in some way.  We have even been taught to equate a demand for horrible violence with God's love.  Is it any wonder that we have so much violence in our society. against people.animals and the environment?  How 'bout that karma! Well. enough of my soapbox.  If you believe in a bloodthirsty sadist in the sky. then this one's for you!  Don't forget the popcorn!"
4,"Christ is to Adult...as Santa Claus is to Child. What kind of sick mind would let their kid watch this pornographic trash? The kind of person who thinks 'Jesus' is going to 'come back'. The type of person who believes MILLIONS are going to 'HELL'. if they are 'unsaved'. The fact that this MYTH of Jesus and the Bible continues to hold sway the world over is nauseating. This religious nonsense has gone on long enough. Throw this sick fantasy away and instead use common sense."
4,"I think the movie could be a 5 star movie . But having to read everything that is said is a little bit too much you might miss some of the film . Mel Gibson I never thought you would release this in the US and not have it in a english version. I hate to have to read all of the movie .I like to just sit back and relax and enjoy the movie . It would be a very big plus to release this one in english . For those who dont like to read movies . May as well just get the book!"
4,"I LOVE this movie So much!  I don't care what kind of trouble Mel Gibson is going thru in his personal life. this movie is really a masterpiece!  It really gets across how much our precious Lord really did suffer for us!  This film makes me want to cry. scream. but mostly it makes me want to CHEER!  And I did!  When I saw it in the theater. and it went off. I yelled 'NO!!! DON'T GO OFF NOW!!!'. but it did.  At least we Christians know the rest of the story-WE WIN! PRAISE OUR LORD JESUS!"
4,"Passion of the Christ is the most controversial film of the year.  It focusses on the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ and nothing can quite prepare you for the amount of gore shown.  It is apparently 100% factual. but do we really need to be shown so much torture on screen - it simply went on and on and on.  It was so graphic that we all had to keep looking away.  There is more blood than you will ever see in a horror film.  But it doesn't end there.  Whiel carrying the crucifix. we are subjected to the beatings that Jesus received along the way.  There is a difference between implying it. and showing it.  I just felt that Mel Gibson went for the shock angle. and subjected us all to far too much gore.  Factual or not. there is no need for so much gore on a screen.  This is not how Jesus would want to be remembered."
4,"He did it for me. and you. No matter what your beliefs. our sins placed Christ on that cross and I. for one. am glad everyday that he did. Is it violent? Yes and that's the point. Crucifixion isn't supposed to be pretty or pleasant or easy to watch. again that's the point. No one else in this world would or could do what Jesus did for us. 'The wages of sin is death' is what the scripture says and he died that physical death because we could not and he knew how  badly we would mess up this world 2000 years later. This is a stunning. life-altering film that EVERYONE should see at least once. Don't miss it."
4,"When I had first popped this into my DVD player. I had a fairly good knowledge of what events I was going to see. I had no idea on how in depth Mel went into it. The movie was in fact word for word of what really happend. The acting was teriffic. The actors really convince the audience of what is going on. And of course the directing was great. Mel did add a little with what I thought was the anti-christ when satan was holding that little child. And yes. Jesus did suffer that much. He was not killed from the suffering because the bible says that 'no man will kill me. but I will yeild my spirit.' So in all. the movie was great. and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
4,"You fools so you beleave in god well your being played like a puppet on a string.If you look at the size of our plannet compared to the rest of the known univers it isn't even a grain of sand on the eaths serface.So if  your going to beleive in something as stupid as jesus and god you might as well beleive in something slightly more relistic like aliens.This movie is a prime e.g of how stupid the masses realy are and how thay can be conned into almost anything.If your going to rent or buy a religious movie i suggest Monty Pithons Life Of Brien it makes a hell of a lot more sense."
4,"Cuba Gooding. Jr does a wonderful job in potraying Dr Carson.  There is so much he had to overcome. non-believers and racism.  But with love and faith he outshone them all!!  When someone believes in miracles. all they need is a chance.Kimberly Elise is simply  wonderful as his mom.  Simple yet strong.  The faith she has in her two sons comes through as heart-warming and true.&#34;Gifted Hands&#34; is much more than I expected.  I read the book and was touched immediately.  The movie brings all those feeling to a higher level. This would be a great gift for those in doubt of their potentials.I had a lobectomy in &#34;02.  The book really shows the depth. emotional and physical.  of such a procedure.I will be watching many times over.  A must have.angie"
4,"Exceptional film that should be in every household.  Here is Cuba Gooding Jr. doing a masterful job portraying a man who faced down his challenges. (and they were formidable). and showed how a champion lives his life.  Held strong by a devoted mother. the hero of this true story shows that the only thing holding YOU back from success and a life of meaning is...YOU.I would buy this now. and share it with my family. many times. and then give it to every friend that I truly care about.  Then look in the mirror. and tell yourself. &#34;Yes. there is indeed a hero within me as well.  No one will stop me now!&#34;Do so. all of us. and make the world shine!"
4,"I have no idea how much Hollywood was added to this movie and to what extent the life and times of Ben Carson were glossed over or idealized. What I do know is the movie was emotional. inspiring. powerful and very touching. This is the story of a young boy who overcomes great odds to succeed in life and make a significant contribution to society.It is also a touching story of the love of a mother. her dedication to her two sons and her strong determination to see they had the opportunity to be the very best they could be. This is an excellent movie for the entire family and I strongly recommend it to all."
4,"BUY IT!!!  I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him. That was before I knew his life history.  I was surfing to watch a movie (any movie) and came across &#34;Gifted Hands.&#34;  As I watched it. I found myself saying what an incredible story it is.  This movie will inspire you.  I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children.  It's very. very good.  I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children.  She agreed that it's the best docudrama she ever saw.  She is inspired and acting on what inspired her.  My husband (not a movie fan) watched it from beginning to end without complaint!  IT'S GOOD!"
4,"I got this video knowing nothing about Dr. Ben Carson except what was written in Amazon's product description.  I like medical history dramas & I lkie Cuba Gooding Jr.  Previously. he starred with Rober DeNiro in 'Men of Honor'. another true life story of a real person.  He did a fantastic job in that other role. playing Carl Brashear. a Master Chief Petty Officer/diver & the first black diver in US Navy history.  Cuba did just as fine a job portraying Dr. Ben Carson. a renown neurosurgeon.  I watched this movie three times before writing this review.  I LOVED IT!  I also enjoy watching the special features & there was an interview with the real Ben Carson & with Cuba Gooding.  The directors have taken pains to make Cuba look as much like Ben as possible.  I'm glad I got it & sorr that three people thought it was a documentary - It is not - it is a movie."
4,"Ben Carson was more then just a gifted surgeon. but a man who had drive and ambition within him that he did not even know he had.  His mother was a great influence in his life and it shows in this movie about Ben Carson's life.  If you really want to know what drives a man then you need to get the movie.  You will learn that what he said at the National Prayers Breakfast was real and that is why the media has since launched a campaign to keep him from advancing his philosophy on life."
4,"This was a true story. and I love the movie.  The acting was wonderful and the message was super.  I saw this move awhile back and remembered it. and I found it at Amazon.com. so I purchased it.  This is one of those movies that give you hope. and shows how just because of circumstances beyond your control can potentially hold you down. there is always a way to climb up and prevail in your life.  Here was a strong. and determined mother who refused to let her sons think in a negative way about who they were.  She stood strong for their sakes and helped them believe in themselves. whereby they did.  When you think you are stupid. you will be; but. when you believe you are smart and have potential. you will.  Great movie and I am happy I now have it to see over and over again."
4,"Well produced script and story of the man we have come to know and respect as one of the great minds of our time! Enjoyable. considering all they tried to pack in from childhood to fairly current times of his life it flowed fairly well. These types of movies tend to be a bit rushed and corny but the writers.cast.director.editor etc. did a great job! I would recommend it as if focus' on his rise to becoming a downright genius of a surgeon etc. and skips his current personal politics so anyone can pick it up and enjoy it!"
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
4,"I most definitely do not agree with Dr. Ben Carson's politics. but I most definitely admire his skill. It's not a particularly great movie. but still worth watching. Actually. I purchased it because I really like Cuba Gooding Jr. and I was not disappointed in his portrayal of Dr. Carson. The rest of the casting is excellent. too. I can't say I love the movie because some of it goes a little slow for me. but there is always fast-forward! If you like biographical-type movies like this then. by all means. purchase this DVD."
4,"A story of inspiration.  Enjoyed this movie so much.  Excellent acting and being from the medical profession. I found the surgery scenes believable and realistic.  Never a dull moment.  Ben Carson is an American treasure who rose above poverty as well as other disadvantages to become one of the most well-known surgeons worldwide.  All young people should watch this movie.  His message of hard work. endurance and perseverence as well as faith. integrity and humbleness has such a positive influence.  What a contrast to the popular message of today...someone else is always to blame. the government owes us something. the education system is to blame for our children's failures..the list goes on and on.  I pray that Ben Carson or someone like him will one day be President of our United States."
4,"I love this movie. and Dr. Ben Carson. What an accomplishment his life was. and is. Overcoming poverty and excelling in the field of medicine. His mother had a beautiful soul. and she knew what a person could achieve in life. with dedication. and hard work. She seemed to know just how to direct her boys. Not only to excellence for Dr. Carson. but she herself overcame un surmountable obstacles. This movie shows what dedicated love. and trust can produce. I have watched this movie many. many times. Never tire of it."
4,"This is an inspiring movie about Ben Carson. the neurosurgeon who was the first to separate conjoined twins who were connected at the head. This is the story of his life from childhood on and how he (and his brother. as well) received victory over struggling with adversity and anger issues and went on to become successful. He owed his overcoming of trials to God and also his mother who encouraged them to never give up and to know they could do whatever they wanted to do in life. Ben Carson is a very gentle. humble. peaceful man.This is a great movie for youngsters. young adults. and older as well. Very inspirational story for anyone."
4,"This 2009 movie is based on the life of neurosurgeon Ben Carson from 1961 to 1987. starting with his getting failing grades at school. His divorced mother dropped out of school in the third grade. works constantly to support her family. suffers from depression. and has to check herself into a mental institution. Upon her return. she sees her two sons' success as hindered by too much TV. and so greatly limits the time they can watch. She also requires that they read two library books/week and give her a written book report. After moving to a better school and getting glasses. Ben becomes a solid-A student and is third in his high school class. Ben's achievements are rewarded with a scholarship and he later goes on to medical school. then becomes a pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins. (His brother becomes an engineer.) At the conclusion of the movie. Dr. Carson operates on two conjoined German babies joined at the head. saving both - a medical first. and requiring a 24-hour operation."
4,"Those of you who are not into true to life inspirational stories--please just move on.The rest of us who can draw inspiration from people who may (or may not) have had it worse than us. Gifted Hands is an excellent. wonderful story.I'm certain many others have chimed in the highlights of the film. so let me just say that the acting and direction was superb.  I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr. in many roles previous to this. and I have to say that this was one of his best performances.Atheists may not like this story. but if so. that's your loss."
4,"I was pleased to see in the extra features that Dr. Ben Carson was on-hand to advise in the production of this biographical retelling of his autobiography. He is a gifted speaker and writer. but I had hoped that they got the story right. Read the book first if you can; it's a page-turner. The movie leaves out some of the faith stories of Dr. Carson. making it a draw to a wider audience. But make no mistake. Dr. Carson credits God with all of his success. pointing out that it was his Christ-following mother that prayed for and encouraged him to reach his potential. taking him to church and teaching him in the way he should go--even as a single parent."
4,"Can't believe I'd never seen this before 2013...every middle school and high school kid should be REQUIRED to view this film once each day for about a year or UNTIL they stop wasting their lives playing video games. watching TV and 'hanging out' and. instead. are inspired to put forth as much effort as Dr. Carson did. If he can go from the 'dumbest' kid in his class. with a single mom. living in poverty and eventually achieve such miracles by his own hands...then anyone can do the same. There are millions of kids who are wasting their lives away who need to see this movie. Can you tell I LOVED it?"
4,"I have recommended this movie more times than I can remember since I first saw it.  As a retired school teacher. I would say it is a MUST if you want children to be motivated toward excellence AND it assuredly gives parents a much needed 'heads up' about how much time our children are wasting on anything and everything that is not preparing them for their future success.  A true story is always the best movie for me and I am so glad I have this one in my library.  I am continually getting it out to share with someone."
4,"I'm a teacher. and when I heard this movie was coming out on DVD. I was extremely excited.  Dr. Carson's life is so inspiring. and the message to students is very strong.  Reading and education opened up a whole new world for him. and as a result. the world is blessed with one of the most outstanding neuro surgeons in the world!  The additional special features also introduces you to the real Dr. Carson where he shares his personal story.  If you know of anyone who needs inspiration to believe in themselves. even when it seems everyone around them sees little hope for them. this is a great movie."
4,"What an encouraging story!  With all the odds against him. Dr. Carson came out on top with his faith and the teaching and prayers of his Mom.  If you are a single parent. I highly recommend this movie as a great source of inspiration.  The positive impact of a parent is so dramatically displayed.And if you are into details. be sure to watch the 'extra' information on the making of the movie.  It will really add to your appreciation of Dr. Carson and those who worked so hard to bring his story to life."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
4,"This is one of the best. and I mean the best explanations of creation without getting 'mushy' religious and anti-scientific. Often Christian views of creation are so anti-scientific and so prejudice that anyone truly wanting a balanced Chrisitan view that includes your mind is left out. This is the DVD for you. Challenging. thought provoking. even funny and entertaining at times. Rob Bell presents to you the best presentation for creation I've ever viewed. You won't be disappointed.I am presenting this material for viewing in a mini-series to and for non-Christian. seeking-the-truth people. I'm not ashamed to present this DVD to these people seeking God. yet skeptical and cautious of the Christian perspective."
4,"I cannot recommend this product enough.  There are so many things to say...it improves your sex life tremendously!  It helps incontinence!  And if you have organ prolapse and are scared that surgery is your only choice...THIS DVD IS FOR YOU!  I suffered for many months with a prolapse and was terrified of having surgery (have you seen all the commercials for attorneys suing for that very surgery?!).  With regular use I've been able to stave off the prolapse!  And my sex life has been so greatly improved because I'm not longer uncomfortable or in pain!  Don't hesitate!  HabIt is worth every penny!!"
4,"I love Olivia de Havilland. she is one my favorite 'Golden Age of Hollywood' actresses. I have seen her in movies when she was very young and the Studios made her do comedies. and she is precious in them. This performance is incredible. she portrays the personality of Rachel to a T. Is she a cold blooded murderess or isn't she? I have never been a huge Richard Burton fan. however. for his first movie. his 'over the top performance' works well here. He comes across very brooding. and is he obsessed with Rachel. or are his fears well grounded? I would recommend this to people who truly like mysteries. In my opinion the only reason it is not quite as good as Rebecca is because Alfred Hitchcock unfortunately did not direct it!"
4,"I loved it-I had seen this movie many years ago and loved it then&#62; I love Richard Burton-He's so deep in this movie-very young and very deep. What a brillant actor he is and became.I gave it five stars because the quality of him overall deserved it.Olvia De Havilland-wow what a brillant star she is. Between the two of them-wow! how different they are-but this movie brought a side we never saw before.Thank you -for the opportunity to share my views."
4,"This one is a classic in hiding - overshadowed by other more marketed ones. like 'Rebecca.' There are similarities. Gentler noir. but noir it is. It leaves one with an obvious question -- was Rachel twisted or not? Heard it said that the author never decided that. just created the intrigue for the reader to determine. My take is that Rachel is so much a child of her particular European culture. being so adverse to the English mindset. that she appears more of an exploiter than she actually is. Nevertheless. it is an interesting story. The movie with Burton/deHavilland is very well done. quite compelling. Recommend for all interested in the classics and the slighter noirs."
4,"Surprised this didn't make a bigger release and it's only available in limited quantities from Twilight Time. I bought this after hearing this movie was based on a novel by Dauphne Du Maurier who also wrote the classic &#34;Rebecca&#34;. This movie I found is almost just as good as Rebecca and is basically about a man bewitched by a mysterious woman. Performances from Richard Burton and Olivia De Havilland are great and it contains maginificent Oscar Nominated black and white cinematography and a haunting score by Franz Waxman. I recommend this movie to all movie buffs and you better hurry and get it before it goes out of print."
4,"Olivia de Havilland is at her best in My Cousin Rachel. I happened to catch this movie on TV and had never heard of it. I searched for it and found it and just had to ad it to my collection. Rachel is Manipulative. Deceptive and Conniving or isn't she? A black widow Spider. she mates and she kills or does she? This movie had me pulled into the story because you love Rachel and yet you hate Rachel. Olivia was a powerhouse and all the reason to see this movie. If you are a fan of Olivias then take a chance. this one will become a favorite for you as it did for me."
4,"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities. we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love. I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan. you might also want to try Hardware Wars."
4,"&quot;George Lucas in Love&quot; is the funniest eight minute short movie that I have ever seen.  What if George Lucas. the creator of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. had a muse. like &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; suggests that the Bard did?  Well. imagine George Lucas living in a dorm at USC. struggling to create a short picture.  And then the fun begins.  This short is laden with layer after layer of inside jokes.  I've watched it over a dozen times. and each time I see another joke that I missed before."
4,"Wow! During the 9 minute span of this short film. these folks were able to throw in every Star Wars/Lucas joke possible (even the low-blow &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; joke before the credits). &quot;George Lucas In Love&quot; is some wildly funny and entertaining stuff! The character swaps keep the humor moving. yet the nice production gives the film a professional gloss.For people who are still uncertain about plucking down some cash for a 9 minute DVD. the extra shorts appearing on the film are fairly entertaining as well! &quot;Evil Hill&quot; and &quot;Swingers&quot; are slightly less affective than the feature. but very funny nonetheless. &quot;Film Club&quot; was just. . . silly! The tons of extras included also add to the viewer's entertainment factor."
4,"This parody on &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; mixed with &quot;Star Wars&quot; is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time. he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately. the script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is all about him. he only needs to open his eyes and see it.The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.The DVD is well done. but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching."
4,"I remember clearly when Hardware Wars came out. with my sister and me howling with laughter at the clever parody. We loved Spaceballs. with its jabs. too. Being a great fan of both the Star Wars trilogy and of Shakespeare in Love. I was laughing out loud at this deft combination of the two done in a mere 9 minutes. It's like the super-fast-Shakespeare spoof which is making the theater rounds - a blast to catch all the subtle innuendos!What's the cost for the video - about the price of a Big Mac these days? I'd gladly pay double for the fun this has been at parties and when friends come over. I don't have this much fun with a lot of commercial sludge that's out on the big screen. that's for sure! Well worth it ... but see for yourself!"
4,"Being a long time Star Wars fan. this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.This is not a spoof of Star Wars. but rather a spoof of  &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. with a Star Wars theme to it.I give  this one two thumbs up."
4,"GEORGE LUCAS IN LOVE is a parody of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; featuring the life of a 1967 George Lucas in USC film school.  This film is less than 10 minutes long. but manages to cram joke after joke in. alluding  to many of the characters George Lucas has created for his films (not  limited to the STAR WARS films).The filming. acting. and score is  superb.  My complaint is similar to others: it wasn't long enough.  I also  feel like the script could have used a little more polish.  However. this  short film is a fun and diverting fantasy. adding another dimension of  folklore to the layered theories surrounding the STAR WARS series and its  much-revered creator."
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
4,"It is amazing how much like todays current events are leading in the same direction as this Soviet Story. It is also the story of the book of Judges. How easy it is for new generations to fall into the same errors as our fathers did. The impact on every generation and every nation is more than evident. Yet! Some how my generation didn't fully understand what took place in WWII our else they failed to instill in the succeeding generations the importance of submitting ourselves to the obedience of grace .To God's credit he hasn't destroyed us yet .He keeps reworking the clay into a image that seams good for him to make .what it should look like is in the mind of the potter. It is truly amazing how God uses every thing in our life to perfect in us all the qualities of the Christ ."
4,"The most important story apathetic Americans don't want to know.  We know through and through the sociopathic structure of Nazism as it pertained to attempting Genocide of the Jewish race. at least in all occupied territories yet we knew nothing of the Empire in the East whom inspired the Nazi Party and indeed it is difficult to find significant differences between the two totalitarian philosophies.  Shamefully. this documentary will be seen or believed by precious few in America before it's too late.  Communism was committing atrocities of the type Nazis did except they did for ~ 80 yrs.  Further. it's little known that Mao Zedong. murderer of as many as 80.000.000 of his own people who perfected the purge (of the committed ranks) long before Stalin adopted the tactic"
4,"This film is a must see. To little is known about the true ruthlessness of the Soviet era. As pointed out in the film it did not stop when Stalin died. American schools do not teach this and a recent column by Barry Rubin pointing out just how this has been glossed over and ignored by virtually everybody. Not only should you watch it but it should be shared with all who will sit for it.One critique I might have is when they go into Trotsky's murder they should tell you that he set up Lennin's secret policde and did mor than a little murder himself. He was no marter."
4,"Thanks to repeated government indoctrination and Hollywood &#34;political correctness&#34;. everybody knows the Nazis were bad guys who murdered Jews.But. there's much more to that story - - -This movie. &#34;THE SOVIET STORY&#34;. reveals how Hitler and the Nazis learned their extermination methods by copying Stalin and the Soviets. with whom they were formally allied for many years. and even after the war. the Soviets continued to use the Nazi concentration camps.Everyone needs to see this movie.I've bought extra copies to as gifts for friends and family."
4,"Nowdays.most Americans do not know who Stalin or even Hitler was(but they know 50 cent). so this movie would confuse most in the USA. Hitler and Stalin were both Communists and were basically on the same team. Marx called for the elimination of 'Trash Races' like the Lithuanians. Poles. Britons. etc. He said those races were too backward to be revolutionary ! So much for all of you 'Useful Idiot' commies. George Bernard Shaw is on the video calling for the development of a poison that would be humane and kill rapidly ( Zyklon B). A lot of information that would not be aired in the USA as it caused a big furor in Europe.The same Blood bankers that created communism then are still running London and Washington and this movie alludes to that."
4,"Blows the door open on Socialism for all to see.  We always suspected that something was not quite right behind the facade of the Soviet 'peoples paradise' and this film confirms it.  Some images are not for the faint of heart but are heart rending  in the brutality displayed. This film should be curricula in High Schools across North America.  Maybe then we could put this fascination and obsession about the glory of Communism to rest once and for all.  The survivor interviews were particularly touching.  Only a heartless b**tard or a devout Socialist / Communist could fail to be moved by the emotion on display.  A must see to fully appreciate the democracy we all enjoy."
4,"The Soviet Union brought a holocaust upon its own people through the imposition of Communism. and caused untold harm to other neighboring countries as well.  Although Stalin tried to get in bed with Hitler. with whom he had much in common. Hitler had other ideas and only then did the Soviet Union become allied with Britain and America.  This alliance of conveniences has caused many in the West to forget that Soviet Communism was just as vicious as German Naziism.  This film tells the unvarnished truth about the old Soviet Union. an institution which Russia and the world are well rid of.  RJB."
4,"Wartime alliances between the west and Stalin's USSR that seemed necessarily to defeat Adolf Hitler's regime only gave way to a regime worse than Hitler's.  It has been argued that the USSR and Third Reich were in a war of attrition that would likely have ended with both regimes bled dry had the US not entered the war and joined the alliance with Stalin.  Perhaps standing back and letting the two regimes annihilate one another would have been inhumane but perhaps it would have resulted in far fewer deaths than the subsequent rise of Stalin in a victorious Soviet Union.  In the end. the two. both insisting they were polar opposites of the other. were essentially the same devil.  This documentary traces the key points that demonstrate how Nazism and Soviet Communism are simply variations on the same theme.  A brilliant documentary that gives rise to a new perspective on 20th century (and particularly cold-war) history."
4,"The visuals were fascinating (did you know a hummingbird egg is the size of a coffee bean?) and the hatching was adorable. However. we gave up and watched it as a silent movie because the sound was annoyingly muffled and we could understand almost nothing of the narration. Why in the world didn't they (a) provide captions or (b) have someone else narrate it? Her voice is pleasant and soothing. but there was no point in listening to the narration at all; I wasn't even sure she was speaking English until I caught a stray word or two. I would have liked to hear the background music. but unfortunately. I couldn't because the sound was off. Frustrating! I am going to return it and get the one with F. Murray Abraham.I bought the DVD as a Christmas gift for my husband. I wish I had bought the book."
4,"If you enjoy watching birds. especially hummers. you will enjoy watching this incredible video. About an hour ago Mrs. Spudman and I watched First Flight and we were both enthralled. Through most of the video I was stunned by the sight of things I had never seen before like the tiny hummingbird eggs. the laying of the two eggs. the hatching. and of course the first flight of the two hummingbird fledglings.This video was three years in the making because of weather. missed shots and the hummingbirds' unwillingness to take direction. The film itself is a masterpiece and the short documentary explaining the making of the film was also quite interesting.  Also included on the DVD is a slide show of hummingbirds. The only shots of the colorful males are shown in the slide show.Honey. the mother hummingbird. built the nest and nurtured her young solo.We were disappointed the video wasn't a little longer. but like the hummingbird. beautiful things can appear in small packages."
4,"Actually. I would give this two scores--a 3 for those already familiar with Gettysburg and a 4 for those not. I can't give a score of 3.5. so I have rounded to 4 stars.For those familiar with the battle. little will be gained by viewing this--other than the very welcome bird's eye view of the battlefield. For instance. the coverage of Pickett's charge doesn't mention the involvement of Trimble's and Pettigrew's forces on the third day.For those not so familiar with Gettysburg. this will be a good introduction. A lot of details are left out. but the basics--from Buford's stand on Day One to &#34;Pickett's Charge&#34; on Day Three--are presented. The stories of Wesley Culp and Jennie Wade provide a certain poignancy to the DVD.So. nice cinematography. a plus. Basic description of the battle--a plus for neophytes and not so much for those familiar with the battle."
4,"As much as I would like to recommend this movie. I have to admit it is not one of the best movies of Jesus life. It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word. which is. at times. a useful tool.That said. the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.If you what the best Jesus movie ever done. nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.The two other parts to this series. Acts and John. are done very well."
4,"i have to say that this video series is AMAZING!  i am a very visual person so i found this very helpful.  as the story progressed it was actually happening on the screen.  i had heard that it took quite some time to get the characters cast.  but it was worth the wait!  the people that were in this set were just great.  i can't wait to see the other series - ACTS.  in fact. i'm going to tell my library to buy this set too."
4,"This is made word for word out of the Bible -the book of Matthew.  It is very well made and a great way to meditate on God's Word daily.  It never gets old and you will find yourself remembering Scripture by picturing the scenes that go along with the Scriptures.It show Jesus as the well balanced God Man out of the book of Matthew.  Some movies portray Jesus as some prune facedbeing -stern and cold.  This video doesn't do this.  It can be a great gift for others also.I have purchased quite a few copies and given them away as gifts.You will never go wrong with God's Word - The Bible.I will continue to buy it and I recommend it to everyone."
4,"Though there are 243 current reviews. none mention the special features on the DVD. which I was hoping to know before purchase. I rcvd my DVD today. and have not yet watched it. but thought I would post the Special Features: +)Languages: English and Spanish. English Subtitles; +)Search By Event. there are 99 bible story events in Matthew from which to choose that will take you to that place on the video. and show the Chapter & Verse numbers on the screen; +) Search By Chapter; +) Biographies. gives a brief bio of 6 bible characters (not actor bio); +)complete Soundtrack of the video (12 tracks). The Narrator is Old Matthew. actor Richard Kiley."
4,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie! We have three different movie portrayals of Jesus Christ. which are completely consistent with their respective Gospels. and we enjoy all of them. (Read my other reviews if you're interested in them.)The happy. laughing Jesus in this movie is intriguing. The way he speaks to people and looks at them warmly portrays his love for everyone. I think the actor really does a great job of portraying the duality of Jesus. how much he loves us. but yet that all is not hearts and flowers and warm and fuzzy due to the human condition.If you're looking for a great movie to share with friends. family. small group. etc.. this is it! Don't watch late at night because you'll want to stay awake!"
4,"I really didn't like the way Jesus is portrayed in this film because it shows Him more as being a human being who plays practical jokes on His Apostles and goofing off during His sermons than being the Son of God who came on earth to save us. Call me old fashioned. but I like the traditional way of portraying the life of Jesus in film. which shows Him as being compassionate. loving. and bold in doing His mission. and yes with a sense of humor. but at the same time taking serious things seriously. I have to say that I liked the Jesus of Nazareth film and 'The Passion' by Mel Gibson. much better."
4,"'The Visual Bible: Matthew DVD' is a visual Bible using the 1984 New International Version translation of the gospel of Matthew with a 4 hour 20 minute run time. The dialogue and narration are directly from the gospel of Matthew. like an audio Bible. which means that events that Matthew didn't write about aren't shown. The costumes. settings. and actions attempt to give a visual idea of what it all might have looked like.I liked that the actors played Jesus and the disciples like real people would act. The actor played Jesus as laughing and joyful when someone is healed. sad when people reject His message. playful when teaching (as some of his teachings contain humor!). and serious when appropriate. This is the type of Jesus that would draw crowds--the Jesus I know from the Bible. It's not perfect. but I really enjoyed watching it. I'd recommend this resource as an enjoyable and thought-provoking way to 'read' Matthew."
4,"Most Reliable biblical movie. The Gospel According to Matthew WORD-FOR-WORD is in the form of a movie. If a movie is not word-for-word it is not biblical. It is Hollywood. i.e. the Devil. Hollywood versus the Bible. You choose what you will feed your mind with. This is my favorite movie of all the &#34;biblical&#34; movies I have. Part 2 to Matthew is Acts. also by Visual Bible and also word-for-word. I give them out as gifts. They are less offensive to unbelievers and the religiously lazy who has never even read their Bible."
4,"I have used this with my college and high school students and even down to my 4-year-old. All I can say is this is absolutely the very best video that I have ever seen on the life of Christ. Obviously Christ's life has been done more than once. but never have I seen a movie that actually used the exact words of the Bible. This production does. It is simply acted out word for word. and you can see the reference at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. I have personally watched several hundred people view this video. and I can attest that about a quarter of the audience likes to keep their Bibles open so they can follow along (at least occasionally). You can't do this with any other Jesus video. And the casting is marvelous. The spirit of Christ lives on. as He is not portrayed as stale and pious. Overall this is a refreshing look. and I highly recommend your investment for all ages."
4,"As I remember vaudeville wasn't in style until the early 1900 and yet here is Jesus doing shtick.  I do believe that he could smile and see humor in some situations but the Sermon on the Mount was not one of them.  I could only make it through 9:9 and had to turn it off.  Just too much levity for my taste.Joy and happiness should be in the heart. mind and soul.  Not external as depicted in this movie.  I kept waiting for the custard pies to start flying.But. in all fairness. the movie was beautifully filmed."
4,"Bruce Marchiano shines in this depiction of Jesus Christ. in the Gospel of Matthew - the Visual Bible. which is a 'word for word' walk through the entire Gospel.  Richard Kiley stars as 'Matthew' at a later age. and you see him speaking the words to a couple of scribes who are recording the words of Christ for posterity and future generations.  It is an amazing sight. and work of art.Marchiano. in a unique portrayal of Christ. draws us into the drama and emotion of the life of Christ. and we experience the tension and intrigue as He sets the scene for what is to come.  I recommend this film highly.  There are approximately four(4) installations of this series. and for a bargain. it can be gotten through some of these auction sites.  It's a definite for your film library!!"
4,"One of the first extended modern presentations of the life of Jesus was &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; starring Robert Powell. This one is the standard and measure of all other productions on the same subject. Bruce Marchiano. although very sincere in his efforts to portray Jesus. just doesn't have the &quot;gravitas&quot; of a Robert Powell.The one point in the Visual Bible's favor is it's dedication to following the Gospel of St. Matthew without any deviation. &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; on the other hand. has the advantage of being dramatically engrossing to a greater extent. &quot;The Visaul Bible's Matthew&quot; comes across as a truly committed and sincere effort. but having a serious disadvantage of amateurish production values."
4,"The Visual Bible Gospel of Matthew is excellent.  I love the acting and the way the Bible comes to life through the word for word script.  I found it very inspiring and helpful.  My four daughters and I have watched 'Matthew' numerous times and it always is benefitial.  I especially like the happiness that Jesus portrays.  We know he drew people to him. and the actor in this video has appropriate expressions and whatnot which make him very appealing.  Throughout the Gospel he is not always happy. of course. but is appropriate to the situations. happy. sad. angry. distressed. etc...  Jesus was very human. and this is apparent in this Visual Bible Matthew.  Jesus was also divine. and God's love shows through as well.  I really highly recommend this Visual Bible. Gospel of Matthew.Thanks!"
4,"I simply adore this movie! It is completely Biblically accurate. using a word for word translation from the Bible yet so highly entertaining. This is the Jesus I think of when I think of Christ. The actor does such a splendid job at portraying what I believe the true Christ would have been like. I've never seen a Jesus on screen better than this.The Visual Bible was a very appropriate name for this portrayal of the book of Matthew. It IS the Bible made alive visually. Don't miss this movie. Buy it NOW."
4,"I actually bought this same set many years ago and loaned it to someone. so I wanted to replace it.  &#34;Matthew- The Visual Bible&#34;. takes an unusual perspective by presenting a side of Jesus rarely seen in movies about Him.  He is happy. loving. accepting and warm to everyone around Him.  He is serious and passionate when confronting the &#34;religious&#34; rulers.  I like the fact that the words never deviate from scripture.This is actually has been a good video for our down syndrome daughter who is usually frightened by other real life Bible  videos.  It has made her happy about meeting Jesus someday because it shows His character as One Who really cares for those who are needy and hurting.  It helped her to understand that Jesus died in her place because He loves her.I strongly recommend this video to add to your Bible video library!"
4,"I loved this version of Our Lord Jesus!  I'm sure that Jesus must have smiled sometime :) This depiction may be a little too different for some to imagine. but I was surprised how fast I was able to adapt to his contagious smile which showed me joy at the message of the gospel.  Once again the visual bible series has done a remarkable job staying very close to scripture and staying clear of over dramatization which so often really destroys the story rather then making it better--you just can't beat the real story.  God bless those who made this wonderful movie."
4,"I have many copies of this movie. I pass it on a lot..I use it in teaching religion classes all the time..Jesus is not a solomman who walks around in majesty...He is a person who loves the people he heals.he laughs.he is charismatic.he cries...he isGod....He is the Jesus I always in visioned.....If you aren't afraid to take Jesus off his holier then thou shelf and placehim in the human world of laughter.love.and pain...and still be the Son of God. I suggest this movie."
4,"I bought three of these because the story is exactly from the bible. I used the Bible to follow the story. Why did I buy three? I have a son in law that every time I watched this. Jesus reminded me of him by his actions with people and his love of children. The other was for a neighbor who is not of my faith but has the same Christ likie values. I expect all who proclaim they are Christians. I bought this also because I am tired of looking at all the poisonous traditions on TV that is making the world more evil."
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
4,"We have purchased many copies of this to give away. and of course. have one for ourselves.  We first got our copy on video years ago and my husband watched it over and over while he was recovering from surgery.  The movie is a dramatized. word for word narration of the book of Matthew. using the NIV translation.  The acting overall is good. the scenery and costumes accurate.  I have to say. I was a little taken back by the voice of Jesus. played by Bruce Marchiano. and that bothered me at first. but I got used to it. and really enjoyed the movie.  Well done and highly recommended."
4,"This is MUCH improved from her first video. The music is not annoying. she's got good people demonstrating proper positioning. and I really like how she narrates instead of talking while doing the routine. I think more videos should do that! I love her opening prayer and how the moves really put me in a spirit of praising God.This routine just seems too easy. like for senior citizens. It's nice to do on a rest day to keep myself limber and for meditating on the wonder of God.I will look for her new power version looking for something more challenging for the muscles.  Keep it up Laurette! We all learn from trial and error."
4,"For those of you guitar music lovers. (mostly men. I guess). this is a great intro to three of the biggest names in guitar-centric music. More importantly. this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all. a great success. Just. please wear a closed shirt next time. Steve. You should be heard more. and seen less."
4,"G3 Live in Concert is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen!  Not only does it have the best guitarists on the planet but they all get to jam together at the end!!  Their virtuosity is a sight to behold!!  I am a fan of all three guitarists and I was in heaven when I saw this DVD chronicling their incredible talents!  Now don't get me wrong there are many fantastic guitarists out there but this concept of getting premiere players together is a great one!Their styles are so different yet you can see the mutual respect that exists among them as they all play together!If you're into guitars or guitar playing you'll be in heaven watching this DVD!!"
4,"Honestly. all individuals are born different from the other. In G3's situation the 3 of them have their own distinctive feeling & style in playing that would obviously lift you up from your seats and scream out loud the word 'Yeah'. That is why I would not and could not classify who is ranking no.1. 2. or 3 among them. Unless. if your head is inflated with fowl air then approach me and I'm 100% willing to deflate your pathetic medical case and grant you guarantees of cure comprise of 'Love & Respect'. Buy this Dvd because your in for a special treat."
4,"This is the first time I ever saw these three guys playing guitar. Satriani. Johnson and Vai. Each of them play 3 songs. and at the end they all unite and play together 3 more songs. This DVD is killer. The quality of the sound is just so good that you think you're listening to the CD. I sometimes turn on my surround sound and play this DVD and makes me think WOW! This is a must for any serious fan. or for anyone who loves guitar music. If I could give it a 10 stars. I'd give 10."
4,"If you are not an instrumental rock'n roll fan and your blood doesn't boil with some extreme overdrive and other guitar effects. this is not for you. If you are a rock guitar player. this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai. as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza. deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson. I have to say. has a very different personality. melodic approach. and technique from Vai and Satriani. but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better."
4,"Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai."
4,"After reading some of the other reviews I really don't have much more to add.  However in my opinion it's as good as the other's have said and then some.  I own three of these 3G concert versions. and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three.  It's too bad they didn't make that a tridition with all three. but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit....A good collection to own if you're in to exteremly hot guitar licks...."
4,"I might get ripped for this review. but i honestly did not enjoy this DVD at all. I bought it after reading all the reviews on this site. Did not really know JB before so i approached it with an open mind. I don't like his overexaggerated singing much. he seems to try to somewhat copy Marc Bolan (personal opinion) and as for craftsmanship on the instrument he seems adequate at best. The other guys look bored and i got the impression the only time they enjoyed themselves was during the heavier songs like 'kick out the jams'. The only song i liked was the last one 'hallelujah' but even that dragged out too much. A redeeming factor was that i aquired the DVD for a bargain and got almost all my money back when i traded it in at a different shop."
4,"To anyone who. like me. only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death. this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program. giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here. all the banter between  songs. the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent. two seperate sound  mixes. regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny."
4,"Wow. this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan. and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert. even if you dont know Jeff. is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album. and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great. try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"
4,"Here is your only chance to see the great talent of Jeff Buckley. live and in person.  Sadly. he lost his life in a swimming accident. and the world will be diminished. musically. by this tragedy.  However. some of his finest work is captured here.  This concert gives the viewer a chance to see a young talent ply his skills with pure artistry. His guitar is captivating. and his voice is haunting.  Give yourself a musical treat. and pick this DVD up.  The only reason I gave it 4. instead of 5 stars. is because of a digital flaw in the song Lilac Wine.  The program stalls in this song.  I checked on more than one DVD player. and they both manifested the same pause.  Other than that... a great buy!"
4,"I enjoyed this production of Don Giovanni. even though there are some aspects I did not like. The musicianship of everyone was excellent. The opera proceeded at a good pace. However I found the constant darkness overwhelming. even though the light background showing the city was very well done. Similarly almost all costumes were black. as if everyone. no matter what was happening. was dressed for a funeral. even those celebrating the wedding between Zerlina and Masetto. Although that is not their fault. Donna Anna. Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira appeared too old to make their passionate roles believable. The parts of Leporello and Don Giovanni were acted excellently: Leporello a servant. ambivalent. who enjoys. but then also dislikes his role; Don Giovanni: a very charming seducer. who can also be cruel. who does not care at all about the effect of his actions on others."
4,"Others who are more knowledgable than I have reviewed the content of this disk and I agree with them for the most part. Let me address the technical issues.  First the picture is mediocre at best.  This is a video source from several years back and it shows.  Things get lost in the blacks and the picture is very soft.  Second. the surround tracks are very disorienting with the voices occasionally issuing from the rear speakers for no reason that i can determine.  I would love to see these companies start putting out disks that at least SOMEWHAT live up to the capabilities of the format."
4,"As a musical family. my husband and I enjoy this video as much as my daughter does!  Members of Stomp and other Sesame Street clips show us that music is all around us--we can make music with anything!  All the rhythmic clapping. tapping. banging on pots (always a fun toddler activity). and singing really keep my 17 month old daughter enthralled.  We're thrilled. because my husband and I really hope she develops the love of music we have. Even if you're not pushing music at home. it's very entertaining for the young ones. and a good video to add to your Sesame Street library!"
4,"The cast of Stomp is a great addition to this DVD.  My daughter fell in love with it the first time we watched it and asks for it repeatedly.  More importantly. it is not overly annoying to adults.How I rated this DVD:* Educational value.  Since buying this DVD my daughter has become very interested in making her own music.  I have found her stomping. making drums from rubbermade containers. and trying to blow in bottles.  She is only 20 months old and I think this is very impressive since we have only had the tape a few weeks.* Entertaining to child.  Keeps her entertained through the whole video.* Entertaining to adults.  I can even watch the tape with her and not become mindlessly numb.* The DVD starts right at the menu.  No annoying commercials to sit through.* Cost.  The video did not break the budget.  It was reasonably priced."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
4,"Cast members from Stomp ! and characters from Sesame Street demonstrate that music. and particularly percussion. can be made and found everywhere.  Combining the Sesame Street habitat with animation and live-action video tape keeps the pace moving.  The variety of musical experiences is remarkable.  We see hand-clapping games and drumming by children. chanting.pot-and-pan banging. as well as  Stomp cast-members' inventive use of  everyday objects that include balls. paper bags and huge oil drums. There's a wonderful sequence  that choreographs cracking eggs and slamming doors.  It's a terrific tape and our 2-year old has gotten a lot from it.One word of advice for those with younger kids.  You may need to use your fast-forward button at times as some sections are perhaps too talky but that depends on your kid of course."
4,"We love this video. I love that it teachs my kids about babies. dogs. and farms. All three shows on this video are done very well. And I really can't say that with all Elmo's world shows. This video opens the way to talk to young kids about babies. dogs and farms. Which is great. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Elmo's World - Babies. Dogs & More! seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I'd say it's in the top 20 favorite videos of my daycare kids."
4,"My 2 year-old son loves almost anything Elmo. so this was a no-brainer.  This was the first Elmo's World DVD I bought for him. because he loves dogs and farms.  It turns out. though. that the baby segment is his favorite.  We like to sing along with 'Old MacDonald.'  Now that we have Tivo. I could have just recorded the last 20 minutes of Sesame Street every day. but this DVD was a nice addition to our library."
4,"I'm ten years old and I love Elomo's world. I mean I haven't watched in a year. When I'm bored it's fun to laugh at how funny. In my way of age. to see such a baby show. It's like teenagers watching Winnie the Pooh. They still like it.It's like for a period of time you are little and like it and then in like first grade you hate it and think it's babyish then in about 5th grade there are no more shows on and you just look on tv and you watch it. I laugh at those things todlers would would listen to. To me it's entertaining! LAlalala Elmo's world!"
4,"I bought this video because my daughter loves dogs and other animals.  I also bought it because there is a segment on babies - as we are having a baby in a few months. I thought it would be good to expose her to little babies.  My daughter this loves this video.  She asks to watch it multiple times every day.  Sometimes we have to hide it.  She laughts at Elmo and really relates to all the animals and babies that are shown in the segments.The video is divided into 3 full length segments of Elmo's World - one on babies. one on dogs. and one on farm animals.  My daughter loves each one.  Plus they are very educational.  If there is a new baby on the way. I DEFINITELY recommend this video as a tool to teach your toddler about babies.  It discusses how to play with babies and what newborns are like."
4,"My daughter doesn't watch much television. and when she does it is usually Dora. Miffy or Blue's Clues on Noggin.  So. I didn't know if she would be interested in this Elmo DVD when she got it for her first birthday.  But now I know that regardless of the main character. babies and doggies are a sure winner.  Watching the little kids play with the babies is my favorite part. and it really gets my daughter's attention.  All in all I do recommend this DVD.  It shows alot. but isn't too fast paced.  Also. there are some very adorbale scenes.  But by the time the farm segment starts my daughter has usually lost interest."
4,"Elmo is so entrancing. I have no idea how he does it. but when this DVD is on. my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo. I get some much needed 'Me time'...Although this DVD gets old for me some days. it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!"
4,"My son received this for his second birthday back in October of 2004 and it has become one of his most favorite DVDs to watch and is one of the 15 or so in his regular viewing rotation.  Kids love watching videos with babies and dogs in them and that's the theme of this DVD.  Elmo learns about what babies eat. how they behave and the joy they bring to their families.Then Elmo learns about dogs and how to feed and take care of them.  Mr. Noodle is along as he does one of his usual silly routines as he walks a pretend dog much to Elmo's and kids delight.The last part of the DVD deals with farms as Old Macdonald joins the fun teaching Elmo all about life on a farm.  Elmo learns about taking care of farm animals and growing vegetables.  This was a fun and educational DVD for kids from toddler all the way through early elementary school. done with the usual Elmo flair. songs and silliness.  A classic!"
4,"This kickboxing workout is wonderful!  It is very fast-paced. but yet it is easy to learn if you are new to kickboxing.  It is really the type that you can do at your own pace.  I have done Tae Bo before. and although it was a good workout. I found Billy Blanks EXTREMELY annoying.  I hated the way he &quot;preached&quot; throughout the entire workout.  This video is much more of what I am used to in an exercise video.  It is well worth the money. especially since the DVD version that I have comes with a 45 minute version and a 60 minute version (I don't know if the VHS tape comes with both versions). This is great to switch up your workouts.  This workout is very similar to TaeBo and I would recommed it highly to anyone who likes that type of workout.  It is also good for people who like Kathy Smith and want to try a new workout."
4,"I've never worked out to a DVD or VHS in my life. preferring to go to the gym and take classes. or to use exercise machines.  This DVD was so FUN and diverse. not at all boring or annoying.  Kathy Smith is energic but not overly so. and she avoids talking and counting constantly which I find distracting and irritating.  What I like is the customized option in which you can choose you work out length-- perfect for when you need to save time or when you want a more vigorous. lengthy work out.  You may find yourself flubbing through the first two go-rounds. as I did. until you get the hang of it. but once you catch on. you REALLY feel the burn if you do it right.  Good work-out for beginner or moderate (I'm a moderate) exercisers."
4,"I really wanted to buy a kickboxing video that would not be too complicated. As a user of other Kathy Smith videos. I decided to purchased this one. The moves are fairly simple and you can get a good workout. Unlike a lot of Kathy's other videos. there are no modifications for lower or higher intensity. but since it is not a standard floor aerobics video. it really isn't necessary to do so. If you are looking for something different to add to your routine. this is a good choice."
4,"I have a lot of fun with this video. I will admit. like a lot of other workouts. it takes some getting used to. I had to do this three times before I learned all the routines. There are very few workouts that I can pick up on the first try.Kathy Smith and Keith Cooke take you through every move and I don't think they are too fast to keep up with.  They stress to go at your own pace. anyway.  (Taebo is just too fast for me)The first time I used this video. my back muscles were a little sore. I also lift light weights (Kathy Smith's weight training of course). so I am used to using my back and arm muscles.I like this video much more than her 'Aerobox Workout'."
4,"I like this kickboxing workout because it is challenging. but also teaches you the kicks and punches that you are using.  It is my first kickboxing DVD.  I can tell that Kathy Smith isn't as practiced at kickboxing as the other two instructors are.  So I find myself watching them to make sure that I am executing the moves correctly.  This one takes a lot of energy. and on really high days. it has a challenge segment.  But I don't believe that it is as intense as TaiBo. from what I have read.The only thing that bothers me is that when I chose to do the challenge. the DVD plays the stretching segment first.  I have gotten the impression that it was not set up very well.  I end up having to manually chose the segments that I want to do.  Oh. it has a great Tai Chi stretching segment as well.  I just found that the other day."
4,"The moves are similar to those found in the Tae Bo routines.  However. the intensity of the workout is significantly less than the Tae Bo workouts.  This workout is great for the begginer or as a primer for Tae Bo.  Kathy  does a nice job with the instructions but performs akwardly compared to the  other instructors.  The music is decent and they are always in sync.  I use  the video as an alternate to Tae Bo either as a change of scenery or on  days when the energy level is low."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
4,"This is a tough workout.  The basic workout is 45 minutes and the challenging workout is 50 minutes.  If you're already in great shape. this will be a good workout for you.  If you're a beginner or intermediate. forget it.  This is something you need to work up to.  Kathy starts at high speed and stays at that pace.  Also. you have to learn the moves on the fly. which makes it that much more difficult.  Final analysis. good workout but only for advanced students."
4,"Holy cow!!!  I was completely drenched with sweat at the end of this workout.  I have a few of Kathy's videos and have always been pleased with her technique.  She doesn't disappoint here.  I have all of Billy Blanks  Tae-bo tapes and this so much better.  A very thourough warm-up leads into  a tremendous workout that keeps your pulse elevated and ends with a great  toning section for the legs utilizing the kicks you've just learned.  A  bonus ab work rounds out a perfect tape.  Also feautured is trainer Kelli  Roberts. from Cher's first video and the star of her own two excellent step  video.  Hope someone signs Kelli up for her own kickboxing tape!"
4,"i purchased this tape last night and reviewed it first then did the workout this morning. this tape shows good correct techniques and posture. which other tapes lack. you can do this tape as a beginner and be slow and  moderate or you can do it like me (a regular fitness gal) and do the moves  with more stamina and endurance. balance and coordination w/o hurting  yourself. the one thing i liked alot was they would do a move and show  Kieth Cooke on the side showing correct posture and correct stance. it is  upbeat. fun. good workout music and the moves are not hard to follow at  all. after 15 minutes. i was sweating like crazy. good good workout people.  try it. it's not boring or slow or annoying for that matter."
4,"I thought this was a pretty decent DVD. I guess the things I dislike about it are:- she messes up the counting sometimes- some of the little mini-routines are clumsy (for instance she'll have you stand there and punch with one hand really fast - what's the point?)- she's rude to Keith Cook (interrupts him. cuts him off. and clearly she favors the woman Kelly. the camera focuses mostly on her and Kelly)- if you watch Kelly. you'll injure yourself (I took lessons in martial arts for few years and Kelly does all these unnecessary gyrations with her hips that would cause her to fall over if anyone was actually there to receive her punches/kicks or punch/kick back. because she's so off center/balance)"
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
4,"I enjoyed it but was disappointed that even though i chose 55 minute option cardio- kickbox workout sort of stopped at 30 minutes. she then worked our legs for 5 minutes? Then that other guy did training of some sort that I skipped. then another training....which wasted 10-15 minutes and then there was cool down.  The good thing about this DVD is that you can select to play certain segments....only one segment can be played at a time though. Warm up was good. Good 10 minutes but cardio type with some stretches that I didn't do- I skipped rope instead."
4,"I started kickboxing with this video. only to find it too challenging.  Though Kathy instructs you on careful and precise movements and good posture. you are really better off going to a class first where someone not  only instructs you but checks that you are doing the moves correctly.  However. after learning how to do the moves correctly. this video is  excellent. though occasionally repetitive.  Kathy and her friend can be a  little bit annoying. but once you break a sweat. they are the last thing  you're thinking about!"
4,"You do not need a jumprope to do this video.  That review may have been thinking of Kathy Smith's boxing video - not her kickboxing video.  I own the DVD.  I find it to be an excellent workout.  I bought it after doing  Tae-Bo for six months.  After doing it. my legs were sore - an indicator of  a good workout!  It has some fun combinations. with some guest instructors.  It starts out with a 15-minute warmup. during which you will do moves to  prepare you for the kicks.  A long warmup is necessary before jumping into  heavy cardio.  Then. you start with punches. move onto kicks. and  combinations.  My only complaint is that the punching drills can become  boring.  If I lost my gym membership. I would begin to do this video at  frequent intervals again."
4,"Kickboxing workouts are a great way to work up a sweat and burn calories. This is a pretty good workout. Keith Cooke. the kickboxing expert that Kathy has on set is fun to watch because he has such good form and energy. Some of the moves and combinations go very fast and it takes a bit of practice to be able to do them. I tried the combos slowly at first and only went 'up to tempo' when I had the form down right.There is a slow kicking section for toning legs and balancing that I really liked.You get two workouts on this DVD--basic and challenge. Get a towel and some water 'cause you're gonna sweat!"
4,"I thoroughly enjoy this video!  It is easy to follow and gives a very good workout.  One of the things I really like about this video is the length of each routine.  Kathy gives you enough time to learn the moves. then practice the move. which lessens the risk of injuring yourself.  Beginners might find this video hard at first. but once you get the hang of it. it's a lot of fun!  And it's great cardio exercise! This video is definitely heads above the Tae-Bo series which goes at a very fast pace and doesn't allow you time to learn what you are doing.  Kathy Smith always does a great job researching whatever exercise genre she is working in and her choreography is very good.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes cardio kickboxing and wants a good workout."
4,"We love this DVD.  My son enjoys and asks for it frequently.  Highly recommend...my son loves to count things now!HOWEVER. I do have just one small complaint.  The 'chapters' are not clean...if you go to the chapter on the number 3 you get the tail end of 2; chapter 5 closes with the beginning of the next number.  This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.I have noticed that the SS DVD's (like Follow that Bird for example) don't have logical clean chapters....why?  It doesn't seem like rocket science to me..."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay. Ernie!"
4,"I am a mother of a 10 month old. She started watching this when she was 8 months old and just simply loves it. I can put her infront of the TV turn it on and a lot of times she will sit and watch the whole DVD! As you know for a 10 month old that is  unusually! But she loves it that much! I have a Nephew that is 2 years old and he just loves it as well! I recommend any parent out there that wants a educational fun Video/DVD for there child ages 6 months- 6 years this one is GREAT!!!!"
4,"Our two-and-a-half year old really got into this. but didn't like 'learning about numbers' at all. except for one little sequence that show 2 girls playing with a dollhouse. the two dvds are actually quite different: this one features elmo and ernie and feels very much geared toward children while 'learning about numbers' actually seems like they were trying to entertain children and adults at the same time by adopting a mock talk show format where big bird is supposed to be some kind of jay leno standup. plus there is a lot of 'The Count' in that LAN. and our toddler didn't like him at all!  Much better choice. I think. for toddlers. Only weakness is that they give short shrift or even skip over certain numbers between 1-20. Some kind of brainless editing decision by somebody who didn't get enought sleep. no doubt."
4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms. the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top. but with little kids. they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting. this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!"
4,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE KID'S VIDEO.  We originally borrowed this from the library.  We liked it so much. and I was so tired of having to return it after maxing out the renewals just to check it out again. that we decided to buy it.  The kids (2 and almost 4 years old) ask for it all the time.  I thought they'd be tired of it after a few months. but it still holds their interest.  The songs are a great compliation of really great Sesame Street production numbers.  We all sing along and. quite frankly. I can't get the songs for the numbers 3. 5. and 10 out of my head. The kids also like the bits with Ernie and Benny (don't call him bunny) between the songs which is usually when the kid's lose interest in this type of DVD."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
4,"Sure. it teaches them to be naughty and tease like Ernie teases poor lazy Benny. but it has a nice story line. and really teaches the numbers -- my son just starts dancing when he hears the title song sung by Ernie.  Lots of the songs are pretty good. and definitely stick in your head.  The great thing(imo) is that Elmo has only a small bit. and this video has firmly lodged Ernie as his absolute favorite Sesame Street Character!!!  He talks about tubby time and bath(not on this DVD though). and has learned some numbers (I think :-)) We have a laugh at Benny every time we watch. which is a few times a week -- would be 24 x 7 if it was my son's choice."
4,"This DVD was very advanced for my 18-month old. In Kids favorite Songs there is a lot of counting backwards from 10 to 1 which my kid loves too mimick (he still doesn't say much that can be understood) so I thought he would love this DVD. There is too much talking in the intro and it bores my kid as soon as it starts plus there is no Elmo. My kid loves Elmo and expects to see Elmo on Sesame Street. We are keeping this DVD for later when he is about 3 he might appreciate it then. Right now he has no interest in it whatsoever."
4,"This is a cute video with some catchy tunes ('one. two three. count with me. we'll count everything around us that we do and hear and see!'). It's not old enough to appeal to parents like me who like Sesame Street nostalgia and want to introduce their kids to the genius of Jim Henson. (Ernie. in particular. is without his characteristic mischief.) But. it's not new enough to be instantly recognizable to the kids of today. I'll put this video on without complaint when my daughter asks for it (she does like it) but it's not one of the first ones I reach for. I like the Count's 'Count It Higher' much better."
4,"My daughter is 19 months old and loves Sesame Street. But we were disappointed that she didn't like this DVD. She found the rabbit/bellhop character annoying and a little scary. He's kind of ugly and mean. and unfortunately he's the main character after Ernie. And her favorite character. Elmo. is only in one vignette. It was also too slow to hold her attention without more of her favorites like Elmo or Cookie Monster in it. She's learning to count just great without it anyway. so we'll probably just give it to someone else."
4,"I bought this video at the same time as I bought &quot;Do the Alphabet&quot; and now my two-year old nephew won't watch it.  He only asks for &quot;Bic Birt&quot; (Big Bird is on the box of &quot;Alphabet&quot;).  I've tried sneaking it into the VCR when he isn't watching in hopes he'll  get hooked. but he always asks plaintively for the other one.  Personally.  I think that they count a little fast for him while the  &quot;Alphabet&quot; tape goes pretty slow.  And Baby Bear is always a  winner.  I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little  older."
4,"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd.  And you know what?  I do. too!  There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs. all about counting.  All the songs are catchy and fun.  My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie. his friends. and Elmo. as well.  Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy. and I highly recommend it!"
4,"I would give this video 10 stars if I could-it is the most wonderful of all the S.S videos I have bought(and I have about 20) The characters are incredibly adorable. and make the process of learning the alphabet fun. not just a task for kids.Unlike a few of the other reviewers who think Baby Bear and his 'lisp' should not have been the focus. are being ridiculous-there are alot of kids out there with speach impediments who talk just like Baby Bear or even worse-I know of 3 in my daughters Pre-k class. Sesame Street shows kids in wheelchairs and kids with Down Syndrome on the show. I guess they should not be on the show either????So. I think he is a welcome addition to the video. Check your attitudes at the remote before playing the video for your kids if you feel that way-it may be annoying to adults-but it is what the kids can relate to and understand that matters."
4,"If you are going to buy one DVD for your child to teach him the ABC's... buy this one!  My two year-old loves this DVD and I have to admit. I enjoy it too.  He can barely talk but knows most of the letters of the alphabet.  He sings along and recognizes most of the letters and can sing most of the alphabet song.  I work with him. of course. but he's gotten a lot from this video.  I highly recommend to any parent of toddler or pre-schooler.  It is one you will watch over and over with your child and be amazed at the results.  The songs are fun.  You hear the letters of the alphabet over and over but in different ways.  Really great."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen!  Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own...PS - yay. Sesame Street!"
4,"My daughter. the Sesame Street fanatic. has begun singing her abc's because of this video.  She's 21 months old.  Big Bird and Baby Bear work on learning the abc's. Baby Bear wants to learn them because Goldilocks gets on his nerves. butting-in and finishing them for him when he gets stuck.  When Goldilocks pops in. it's pretty funny.  Not a good video if your child only craves Elmo though.  He does NOT appear in this video.  For everyone else. this is a cute way to learn the abc's and have fun with them at the same time."
4,"This video is a great. fun way for kids to start learning the alphabet. It's filled with good and catchy songs. entertaining cartoons about the different letters. good 'live' segments (as in using real people instead of being a cartoon). and a great story to tie it all together.My 16-month old daughter is already starting to sing along with the first song (ABC-DEF-GHI). dances along with the 'T-dance' skit. and beats her hands in time with the jazzy 'Alphabet Blues'. She still isn't really able to talk (not having a decent set of teeth yet makes it hard to say certain letters). but I have a feeling that once she does she'll be saying the whole alphabet in short order."
4,"My kid loves Elmo so I usually get Sesame street DVDs for him to watch Elmo. It was a bit disappointing that Elmo doesn't feature in this one. But he does get glued to it all the same with all the singing and dancing. In terms of educational content and approach to teaching the alphabet to kids. I think it's excellent and is quite entertaining too. The Alphabet support group idea adds a nice touch which I doubt my kid would understand now but had me laughing to bits the first time I watched it."
4,"I personally find Big Bird to be an annoying character. but this show is pretty good for helping to teach the alphabet.  I only rate it a 3 because it is not a show I enjoy watching with my daugher.  I also don't notice her laughing and being engrossed with the story the way she does with Franklin videos. Bear in the Big Blue House videos. and even Elmo videos.  I also don't particularly care for the Baby Bear character either. because he doesn't speak well (they have him speak in &quot;baby&quot; talk which means he mispronounces certain letters.)  We've had this video for about 8 months and my daughter never requests it anymore.  Maybe she's too old (28 months). but I doubt it.  She still loves to watch Sesame St. on PBS."
4,"This video does a great job teaching the alphabet - the conceit is that Baby Bear can't get all the way through saying the alphabet. while Big Bird and the gang help him learn it.  Having Baby Bear get stuck at a different letter each time really works - my two-year-old occasionally finishes the letter for him.This video has better between-clip production values than some Sesame Street videos - but die-hard Sesame Street fans will want to see it's songs like 'J Joe Jeans and his Jellybeans.' and. my favorite - Henson and Frank Oz as Ernie and COOKIE MONSTER doing 'D.'  An incredibly funny clip.So. this video does its job all the way around - teaches and entertains!  Enjoy!"
4,"When Baby Bear gets frustrated with Goldilocks for always interrupting his alphabet reciting. he turns to Big Bird for help. Big Bird must help him learn the alphabet in 24 hours. And he does. with the help of all the Sesame Street characters (and Billy Joel) and a new alphabet song! Forget the old way of singing your abc's ... this movie will change the way you sing it for good! So catchy! My daughter loves this movie. It's one of her favorite in the Sesame Street series. It runs about 45 minutes long and keeps her attention pretty much the whole time. Recommended for anyone with little ones running around!"
4,"The 2 20-minute workouts get 3 stars and the bonus section 5 stars.This workout is pretty easy to follow and I thought. Kathy did a very good job teaching each type of dance step in the first part of the workout. However. there are sections in the middle and in the second half that didn't flow well. It seemed that she was not in synch with the music at times. which was distracting. The music isn't that great either. Also. if you've ever tried the awesome Latin Xplosion with Carlos then you know. this just doesn't even come close.In the bonus partner dance section (without Kathy). one of the male and female exercisers demonstrate how to dance Salsa. Merengue and ChaCha. They both do an excellent. excellent job and make it look super easy to learn."
4,"This is a terrific workout -- fun music. fast paced. and very invigorating.  Kathy does introduce the dance steps quickly. and sometimes you might feel a bit lost.  However. BE PATIENT.  It will only take you a few viewings to get the moves. as they really aren't very complex at all.  The pay-off is worth the effort.  I'm 53 years old and have been doing step aerobics for over 20 years.  During the past 4 years I've had some injuries that have prevented me from doing the high impact step DVDs. so I had turned to Leslie Sansone's walking videos.  These are okay for days that I don't want to get too sweaty. but I wanted a REAL workout that would get my heart rate up in a FUN way.  This Kathy Smith Latin workout is just the right thing for me.  If you feel like Leslie Sansone is too easy. but high impact aerobics are problemmatic. then try this workout!"
4,"Well. my title say's it all. what a dissapointment. What you think your getting. you don't get at all. To keep my review as 'to the point' as possible. this looked like an amature video. First of all. they are wearing black pants in a dim studio so therefore it is really hard to see exactly what they are doing with there legs and feet. Secound. Kathy is all over the place with her movements and not in a benificial position for the viewer at times. There were times where she would introduce a new movement. and the camera wasn't even on her. She almost at times looked like she had forgotten that she was suposed to be 'teaching' this routine. There are also moments where she had forgoten in the original taping to que a new movement. so you will here an overhead of her voice. which is just so amature and cheap. I give this video 2 stars because it is not worth more then 2 dollars."
4,"Being half Hispanic I'm quite familiar with Latin dance. Both my parents have been dancing salsa for years. the old traditional style. that is. not the new age salsa based on the Latin Hustle of the 80s.Kathy does a good job. and so do the two very professional people framing her. I must say that I've read some of the other reviews and I simply can't understand why somebody would say such insulting things about Kathy's dancing. and even about the others. I understand people are entitled to their opinion but to say things like robotic dancer. clueless. don't buy this DVD. a total waste. and worse things.... Is it really that necessary to be that insulting? Kathy is a lady. and a professional."
4,"This is my first Kathy Smith video and I think my last.  While the music is fun and encourages you to move. Kathy Smith herself has the opposite effect--she is cold and out-of-place.  The workout is not by any means challenging--that was the reason I selected this tape over others.  However. if it THAT basic even for someone like me (not a lot of exercise experience. no dancing experience. and not particularly good coordination) and it is not that much fun. then what's the point."
4,"This workout is fun. fun. fun!  Kathy is as great as ever. the other instructors have big. natural smiles on their faces. and the whole class looks like they're just so darn happy to be there!  I am not a fan of sappy  enthusiasm and maybe that's why I appreciated the real energy of this  group.While I admit that this isn't the most grueling workout in terms  of fitness challenge. it is different. interesting. and fun.  I love the  atmosphere of the Conga room and the live band plays some fabulous music.  Don't expect to break a sweat or get your heart rate up too high. but if  you want to dance this is the video for you!Now if only I could find a  partner for the special instruction at the end.......(A million times  better than the CRUNCH Fatblaster Goes Latin video!)"
4,"I'm not fat but I'm pretty klutzy.  I assumed that this DVD would actually be suitable for a beginner to get the simple steps and then move along with; that they;d start with an introduction and then start an easy routine and move up to something more 'complex' but still suitable for a beginner.Their review on the steps were 3 small sections in the beginning that just slowed the video down (good luck basing your dance routine off of a slow down if you're brand new to it) and then jumped right into the routine.  For someone like me. who doesn't have much self esteem and feels stupid dancing alone in her room with the blinds shut...this doesn't help you feel more comfortable.  It makes you feel more klutzy.The warm up is easy enough though.And if you give yourself a few weeks to get the routines down. you'll probably be OK.It just wasn't for me though..."
4,"I have never had so much fun with an exercise video until I did the 'Latin Workout'. I was very impressed with Kathy and her assistants. The music was marvelous and very authentic. I love Afro-Cuban music. I really worked up a sweat. You can get a lot out of this video when you put more effort into the moves. This video is so enjoyable the time just flies by. I really had to get used to moving my hips. It felt so dirty but in a nice and sexy sort of way. I can exercise to this video everyday. So if anyone is considering starting an exercise program with a lot of fun. start off with this video."
4,"This video is so much fun to do! This is a video I can do without taking any water breaks 'cause it's just so much fun to do! The dances are easy to pick up. plus they're good to learn to do at any parties. Kathy gives good instruction. so it's very easy to keep up. Although I mention the word &quot;easy&quot; a couple of times. this workout is still very challenging. It gets your heart rate up. and you'll definitely break a sweat. But you'll be having so much fun. you won't even notice!"
4,"This is by far the best video I have ever done. especially for the fun factor.  And I have done over 50 exercise videos in my time.  If you are an intermediate exerciser this is a must have.  I can't explain how much fun  this video is.  You learn the Cha-cha. Merengue. Salsa. Samba. and the  Cumbia.  It's broken down into 2 segments that are 20 minute each.  I do  both because it is so much fun.  There is even a partner dancing segment at  the end.  Definately get this video!"
4,"I really like this video! No. it doesn't work you really hard. but it's an excellent alternative for days when you have less energy. I use it when I am not going for the most intense workout I can get. but still want to get my heart rate up and sweat( it's about 40 minutes). What I enjoy about it is that it's really fun to do. Everybody looks like they're having a good time. The music by the live band is great and the moves are a lot of fun. I'm sure that this one will remain a favorite of mine for a long time."
4,"This sensational DVD. culled from a TV show I have cloudy memories of from my youth. presents Andy Kaufman in a way that surpasses the Milos Forman biopic (not to denigrate Jim Carrey's outstanding performance) and the  A&amp;E Biography. You get it all here. and it's mostly hilarious. Best of  all is Mr. Kaufman's dead-on Elvis impersonation...his choice of songs is  impeccable--&quot;Too Much&quot; is an Elvis hit that Mr. Presley seldom  performed live. Great introduction (or reintroduction?) to this fascinating  character."
4,"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available. it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling 'the ladies'-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda. Bob Shapiro. etc.)Basically. if you loved 'Man on the Moon'. you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
4,"This one should be reissued in DVD. I am a grandmother and remembered how much my children. one of which is now a professional artist. loved this. I was not wrong. My three year old granddaughter requests to see it everyday over many other choices when she comes to visit. She is frightened by the wizard and cried when Sahu goes to his parents; she didn't understand why he went away. but would just come get us to sit with her for that part. She is still requesting it a year later. I have memorized the songs. As with so many others brought to you by Sesame Street it is treasure for all ages."
4,"Because it certainly desrves it. Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney. this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift. but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl. and keep hoping that it will be released.One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace. Whatever your chronological age. you will find this program timeless in it's appeal and beloved by all.That is what indicates real staying power. not how many toys one can invent. market and make profit from."
4,"As a kid. I used to watch Sesame Street. a show that was by then a classic. My parents bought this film from the library and my sister and I watched it constantly. My dad still remembers songs from the film and my sister and I reminisce about it.The plot of the story is that the kids and the puppets get locked into a museum overnight. They get to tour the area without being bothered by others. Oscar the Grouch sings a song about wonderful trash. referring to the broken statues all around him. Cookie Monster sings the title song when he gets hungry from looking at still life paintings all night. Big Bird and Snuffy find an Egyptian Prince and attempt to help him become a star in the sky like his parents. Everything that happens is entertaining and educational.Not only does this film address a side of schooling that isn't always addressed in schools. art. it is a great way for parents to spend time with their children and help them to grow."
4,"Elmo does it again -- steals the show as a dusty but lovable little monster 'Cinderelmo' who toils with housework while his evil step mom and step brothers get ready for the Princess Birthday Ball.  The music is infectious. the characters all play memorable parts. the guest actors are WONDERFUL in their roles as Fairy Godfather (Oliver Platt). The Evil StepMom (Kathy Najimy) and Princess (Keri Russell).  I play this movie several times per week for our two year old because she just adores watching the scenery and singing along with all the catchy and original songs.  This is a must have for any Elmo Fan!"
4,"My daughter. who just turned 1. has been an Elmo fan for a little while now. This is the only thing with Elmo that she doesn't like. She wouldn't watch more than 5 minutes of it. It's much different from other of his videos. It's more scripted and less animated than his normal segments. I think it would be more popular with 2 or 3 year olds. especially if they're familiar with Cinderella. I loved it and am saving it. I'm sure my daughter will warm to it in the upcoming months."
4,"this is from the series of books that spawned the wizard of oz film.in this one.the lion must find the ultimate icon of good or something to that effect.i belive its a flower.dorothy is along for the ride too.the witch has a evil icon that spreads evil to everything it touches.only the flower can stop the witch.the kids like it some.its a fantasy/adventure type deal.the wizard of oz movie was far better than this cartoon.ive never read the book but i think it would be quite excellent.id love to see the other books turned into films also."
4,"I taped it off of Toon Disney. I'd never heard of this movie before. but me being the Oz fan that I am. I thought I should check it out. Overall. it was a pretty good movie. I like how they developed the friedships between Wimsik and Lion and Caroline and Captain Fitzgerald. Silly is an interesting character but he lightens the movie up a bit. There are some beautiful songs even if Wimsik's voice was digitally worked to make her sound better. They depicted very well the hatred the Wicked Witch of the East had for her sister. It also has a bit of a mystery to it which was very creative. The animation was very nice. It's worth the watch! Check it out!"
4,"This is the best purchase anyone can make if you want to shred being that finding a good teacher that can teach this skill is not easy. Paul besides being an incredible player covers all bases of Alternate Picking and String Skipping like he was in front of you. This is worth every singe penny. Now you have both instructionals on one DVD for the price of one!!!!I own a vast array of instructionals. and if you only had 17 dollars to spend on a dvd. this is the best money you'll ever spent. Paul teaches shred like he was in front of you and believe me. no one posseses that skill. I also recommend his other instructionals after you are ready to move forward from this one Terryfying Guitar Trip. Get Out Of My Yard and his latest. Silence Followed By a Deafening Roar.RATING 10"
4,"Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things don't necessarily go together.  His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping.  I really don't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument.  Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion. and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works.  I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I've purchased over the last thirty years. and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three.  If you are at all interested in shred guitar. you simply have to buy this.  Many of us paid $40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos (parts I and II). so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price.  Thanks. Paul!"
4,"I'm brand new to the Andy Kaufman band wagon.  Hoping to spend as little money as possible while purusing a local video store. I happened upon this one.  All it is. is a narrator with an incredibly boring. insomnia-healing voice give a 35 minute account of Andy's life.  While there are several hilarious clips featuring Kaufman. his voice is nearly always drowned out by the super-boring narrator.  Considering the pranks and antics of this unpredictable showman (who did not like to be referred to as a comedian). he probably would have laughed his head off at the people who actually bought this video.  This video ranks right up there with Andy trying to get ABC to purposefully screw up the reception for his Special.  Please. especially if (like me) you're a newcomer. stay away from this one.  Go with the &quot;Midnight Special&quot; instead.  It's great Kaufman humor and also very clean humor (something you just don't find nowadays)."
4,"Maybe this is all part of THE JOKE; to get people caught up in the reemergence of Kaufman fame and then to purchase a totally CRUMMY product. HAHAHAHA! I bet Bob Zmuda (Andy's best friend) was a behind this. HAHAHAHA!  Just reading the reviews got me to laugh. Part of Andy's act was bombing on  purpose. Go back and watch this again or compare the part in the movie when  Kaufman wanted the ABC special to look as if it was messing up. (MAN are  some people gullible...)"
4,"I had seen the author make presentations on television before and thought this would be a great video to own. Had I seen parts of it prior to purchase I would not have bought it. Most of the video is him talking to TBN hosts. It would have been a better video witout the connection of TBN hosts. He should have talked to the audience (or camera) and not to the two people sitting there with him.The presentation was subdued and I have to say boring. Great information was provided but you had to force yourself to stay awake to hear it.I was also disappointed that the segnments all started with the same introduction. It was like it was an addition to add more time to the length of the video so you could advertise it as a longer length.Very disappointed.For anyone else I recommend you skip the movie and buy the book."
4,"I enjoyed the message David tries to portray and have respect for what he is trying to tell us. I am disappointed in his presentation.  Our family home schools our children and we were hoping to be able to use the series to educate our children about the christian message.  The American Heritage Series is basically just a long lecture. Its an unpolished narrated lecture that makes history boring like they do in many classrooms.  David is like the expert professor who puts his class to sleep because of presentation. I rate him 3 stars. Actually an average of 5 stars for content and 1 star for presentation."
4,"I learned a lot about our nation's history that simply isn't taught in our classrooms anymore.  David Barton lays out the facts.  This is the History of our nation in the words of the men who made the history.  The recent textbook battle in Texas was largely over this issue: getting the real history of our nation back into the history books.  I can understand why people with a certain political agenda wouldn't want this information out there. but if you want the whole truth and not the current edited version of history that is being taught in so many of our classrooms today. this is for you."
4,"The informational content is superb but it is presented in a combination of psudeo talk show and lecture format. In addition. Mr. Barton speaks very fast and dispenses a large volume of information in a short amount of time. The result is that the episodes tend to be dry and boring. Adding to these difficulties is the fact the DVDs include the promotions for the series from when it aired on TV. As a result the episodes are interupted approximately every 8 minutes with what amounts to a commercial for the series. This gets exceptionally tiring after a short period of time. While I would wish that every high school student in the nation along and every adult citizen study this series. I think that anyone who is not seriously interested in the subject matter will find watching it to be a tedious affair."
4,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement 'Separation of Church and State' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long. and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
4,"I loved history in grade school. junior high into high school though my junior year a teacher ruined it for me with her non-teaching ways with popping in a video and leaving a worksheet before leaving the room for the period. Evolution is what was preached and shoved down our throats. History became boring and choking with it's evolution and anti-America BS. bringing me to pull out of the rest of my history classes and having a distaste for (public) education. Now that I am enrolled in University my love for learning and history is coming back. American Heritage Series has brought my love of history back! Love that He encourages you to read the original documents and research for yourself. Thank you Mr. Barton and God bless you."
4,"David Barton. as a first-class researcher. has furnished the indisputable historical proof of the godly heritage in the founding of America. Watch and learn as you explore the fascinating details. events. and personalities of US history. Great care is given to the unfolding drama of our nation's godly tradition as the DVD set covers a massive amount of captivating amazing-but-true stories.Some of the topics covered are how faith influenced American:- Education- Religious freedoms- Civil and judicial domains- Cultural and societal arenas- Separation of Church and State- And much moreOver twenty episodes that will thrill you and your whole family. Great for church Bible study or home school."
4,"David Barton's a treasure.  Thankfully. he's taken it upon himself to preserve the Great documents of our forefather. that went into making America great.  There's been so much effort to play down and revise our history and make it conform to the lax standards of today. that whole generations haven't had access to the authentic original wording. penned by our founding fathers.  I'm so glad Mr Barton had the fore-thought to preserve our history. for us and future generations.  Now. we all have no excuses. not to 'pass it on'.  And...he does it in a very interesting. riveting way.  He has a site: [...] where a lot of great info can be accessed. also..and a Facebook page.  We need to patronize him. so he can keep up the good work!"
4,"I first started reading the Mandie books when I was twelve.  Needless to say. I'm more than twice that age now.  So it was quite a delight for me when I stumbled across this movie at Blockbuster.  I had no idea they were making Mandie movies. I'm so glad to see it!  I thought this movie did a fairly accurate portrayal of Mandie and her kin.  I really enjoyed the Cherokee personalities.  And I thought Dean Jones as Jason Bond was especially good.  Uncle John was well portrayed by a dapper young gentleman.  And in essence. the movie was darling and very likeable.  The single and only reason I don't rate it a five star movie is because I thought the almost comedic style of acting in the movie detracted from what could have been a very serious and successful story line.  Other than that. I really enjoyed this movie."
4,"The overall impression of this movie is of a very nice movie for children; almost everything about this movie is suitably designed for young children. I have not read the books and watched this one on a hunch. The movie was sufficiently interesting to keep me watching all the way to the end but I would expect many members of the younger audience. pre-teen for example. to enjoy the movie much more.Of the actors only one was familiar and that was Dean Jones and he was also one of the few that didn't specifically look like they were acting.The scenery was beautiful and had some very lovely settings in the woods of North Carolina. The overall ambience of the movie was appropriate for a young audience as well. This is a good solid move for children and I recommend it as such."
4,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's cute. fun. enjoyable. and clean--and also inspiring and moral.Frankly. after reading some of the reviews of the film. I was expecting a movie with awful acting and amateurish production.  I saw neither.  Oh. the acting isn't Academy-Award quality. but it's not that bad either.  Similarly. the production quality isn't at the level of a George Lucas film. but it's not what I'd call amateurish by any stretch.  Overall. I thought the acting and the production quality were both pretty good. certainly good enough to make the movie entertaining.This is really a charming. fun movie that the whole family will enjoy.  I give it five stars because I love the movie. in spite of its very minor flaws."
4,"Much more than a typical family film. this is the highest quality 'independent' or 'small studio' film I have ever seen.  An excellent blend of history. drama. mystery and a touch of humor.The producers used Imagery and Lighting brilliantly. whenever they focused on Mandie during the flashback scenes when the 'Indian Story' was being told.An absolutely outstanding performance was given by Lexi Johnson [who played Mandie. both in this movie and in the first sequel].  Her prior acting experience [all five movies of the Sugar Creek series] can be seen in the attention to detail and nuanced expressions she brought to this role.  The entire cast and production also deserve much credit.I totally agree with a previous reviewer who commented 'the movie was magical!'"
4,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL. LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON. SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE. SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA. AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE."
4,"Discerning viewers. not distracted by production values not on par with multimillion  dollar Hollywood productions. will find in this film a message fitting for our times. This film is about a young family enjoying the American Dream until it goes bust; however instead of finger pointing at political figures. or scrambling for help from government or extended family. this family discovers there is sound reason a certain historical figure from Nazareth is called Saviour. Mighty Counselor and the Prince of Peace - peace for the soul. This film poses the question. As America descends into the abyss. what can you place your trust in - promises of politicians. the life savings and benevolence of friends and family. or the living Lord?"
4,"I loved this movie. it would be a GREAT movie to show to a Youth group at church as I believe this movie teaches not only about Hosea. but it has a GREAT message about acceptance and how we all are going through things at one time or another and how we should not judge others because of their seemingly standoffishness.... (if this is a word).... I was shy as a young teen. and was going through things at home.... had no friends and I could relate to this girl..... thank you Beverly Patton"
4,"This movie is a well made well acted movie about God's amazing love. This movie is a must see for youth groups! I know from when I was in youth group that there are a lot of cliques in youth group and church. but church is not an exclusive club for those who fit a certain mold. This movie shows that we need to live out Christ's love and gives very practical ways. The movie flashes back to the story of Hosea and Gomer and really explains how much God loves us. I would highly recommend this movie!"
4,"The director used an interesting approach - showing an expanded story of Hosea and Gomer. which is not supported or denied by scripture. as a story being told by a youth group leader trying to demonstrate unconditional love toward a young lady who is struggling to fit in anywhere. especially at a campground with a bunch of church kids. At times the switchbacks are reminiscent of The Princess Bride as the youth group members interrupt the story being related to them to offer personal opinions about the unfaithful wife and her doting husband. The Hosea part of the filming was awesome - the youth group part not so much. but still commendable. This is definitely a film that should be shown in all youth groups. I'd highly recommend that Christian parents of teens add this one to their personal film library."
4,"This is a really great Movie For almost anyone to SEE! It kept My attention the whole Time! They did a great job flipping back & Forth from The trials  Hosea faced during His Time (  Straight Bible ) & the teenagers & really all of Us as We met New People And realize We are ALL different .We all have different backgrounds .We need to remember Instead of ' Pasting Judgement ASAP' Practice  The Golden Rule! LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES We might find We are going to find new friends & nice People!"
4,"Richard Boone is both narrator and participant in some of these episodes.  The historical background given by Boone in the opening scenes is brief and to the point so that you can be taken to the scene of the action quickly and efficiently.This series is a fine snapshot of medical practices of the 1950s which might seem outmoded now.  Electro-convulsive therapy is shown as a treatment practice in the '50s.  The effects of a nuclear bomb explosion are graphic and chilling to watch and listen to.  The open heart valve replacement is quite intriguing even in black and white.  Overall this is a series that while it might seem to be somewhat dated is good for historical background and comparison with the way medicine is practiced now.Growing up in the 1950s this was the state of medicine as I knew it and it seemed pretty impressive.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in medical history."
4,"I first rented this when I was about 15 &amp; my mum went apes**t. A movie about a guy who kills people with a blowtorch. COOOOOL! However the blowtorch isn't that big a player in the movie. This is your typical Vietnam vet revenge story ad nauseum. Vet Ginty seeks revenge on the creeps who ripped up his best friend with a clawhammer (Steve James- who briefly adds &quot;life&quot; to the movie). There are some hilariously bad gore scenes. including the decapitation in the opening scene which has to be seen to be believed. and how could I forget the sequence with the meat grinder? I'd advise you not to eat a hamburger while watching this movie. Worst of all though is the godawful country-western song which plays during the opening credits. Yeech!"
4,"The late Robert Ginty. R.I.P.. lays down some rough road in this one. though the guy on the cover aint him! This is a NY picture. like Street Trash. Ms. .45. The Wanderers. The Warriors. The Lords Of Flatbush. The taking Of Pelham 1.2.3. (the original 70s version with Walter Matthau. Robert Shaw. and Simon Oakland. not the unneccessary '00s remake!). et al. And like all good made-in-New York movies. you know eventually somebody's gonna be handed their ass!! This is no exception. Be prepared to suffer. You have been warned! The sickness with the quickness!!"
4,"I was a huge fan of exploitation cinema back in the day. So I was a bit disappointed when I could not remember ever seeing this 'classic'. And I am even more disappointed for having seen it now. It's not going to win awards (not even Razzies) and everything screams 'tacky'. but I guess I'm just mellowing with age. Not for serious fans of realistic cinema or quality films. but certainly for people who enjoy their guilty little delights. I'm just not of those people anymore. I guess."
4,"I've had this tape for a little over a year. and I still reach for it quite often. The instructor is warm and friendly and explains how to get into each pose with percision. I always feel loose and relaxed after doing this workout. This is the tape that made me want to try even more yoga tapes to expand my practice! I recommend it to everyone I know just starting out. The price can't be beat and neither can the style. Although I have aquired more tapes recently. this tape will stay in my yoga practice for a long time to come!"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
4,"This movie does have entertainment value. and it is affordable enough to entertain some friends at home on a rainy day.  The video is grainy. almost 16mm like in appearance.  The music and sound effects during the fights scenes reminds me of the 60's campy hooded crimefighter shows. ZAP!  BOOM!  POW!  Holy Low budget Cinema! is what Jack Nicholsons trusty sidekick would say if he had one.  There is a story and it is ok.  Buy it for your collection. otherwise pass."
4,"I've seen this one three or four times on Speedvision. Kind of ruthless toward the women but conveys the style of the Hell's Angels. Too bad about Adam Roarke. He was a good guy. a pretty good actor. stunt man and.... well he died a little before his time. I could call myself a biker but my Kawasaki Z1R although quick doesn't quite fit the image of a Harley Davidson. Some how Jack Nicholson just doesn't fit in either. Sonny &quot;Ralph&quot; Barger sure does!"
4,"This one totally bites.  Unless you were born in the 40's this one is completely out of date.  No bite no bang and way too much buck.  The music is so annoying my girlfriend had to leave the room.  Hippy dippy elevator music with big bad bikers.  Everyone in this movie is an idiot and none of the chicks are hot.  If you are into biker flicks check out Hell Ride.  That's a biker flick.  This is yet another example of how phony the 60's were.  Save your money.  I wish I had."
4,"If you like biker movies with realism this is it ! Real Hell's Angels and their bikes from the mid 60's . Great acting ! This is one of Jack Nicholson's early movies and Adam Roarke does a great job as the leader . It is a good story about a loner who it tired of playing the 'straight game' and quits his job at a gas station . Later that night he runs into the Hells Angels at a bar and ends up prospecting for the club. The original bobbers are so cool as they are the real machines of the day . Great fight scenes . great riding scenes . a 60's love in party and a cameo apearence in the beginning of the film by Sonny Barger himself really puts the touch to the film ! I would give this one a 10 !"
4,"Kudos to RareFlixNClassic for reliable and expedeiant service. ordered (03 March 2010) same time as other products. I recieved this one 9 March 2010 and as of 10 March 2010 Amazon still has not shipped the other iteams oreder with this one. All with the super saver shipping including this one. Quick shipping. Recieved product as advetised in new condition. The movie it self is a classic anti culture movie ot its time. I like the movie for what it is and you get to see Nickolsen from his earlyer years in the buissness."
4,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan. Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah. the Three-Headed Monster. this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If. though. you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most  horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall. Tokyo is not threatened. no buildings are crushed. no tin tanks are destroyed. no thousands of people flee in terror. there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
4,"This was one of the first Godzilla movies I saw as a kid and to this this day it's my number one favorite Godzilla movie. Plenty of monsters in this flick you get the return of Rodan.plus you get to watch Godzilla and Rodan go at it and then you get to watch Godzilla;Rodan. and Mothra team up and fight King Ghidorah the baddest of the villians in the Godzilla series. The story line was really good in this Godzilla flick as well it had a James Bond twist for human drama in this film which kept it interesting. The monsters got plenty of screen time on this flick which made it even better and this is one of the few Godzilla films that don't involve space ailens controlling the monsters as well. In this one you actually get to see the monsters be monsters. The special effects in this film were good especially when Ghidorah starts destroying the city and the monster battles were awesome in this one as well. I would definetly recommend this one to any Godzilla fan out there."
4,"I have been waiting for this for what seems like ever. and I have not been disapointed.  This was one of the few films that I have watched through the whole of my life and never been tired of.  Whether it was the English or Japanese version I loved it.  Everything about it was awesome and even if the DVD didn't have special features I would have purchased it the moment it touched the shelf.If you are a fan of science fiction. kaiju. or just monsters in general then do yourself a favor and pick this film up turn the lights down low (where applicable) and get ready to be amazed by the cheezy monstery goodness that came to you from a long long time ago from a far away land across the sea.A simple plot with enough mystery to keep you plugged in and enough human drama to make you car abou the characters and enough monsters  and sci fi to keep you happy.  Just watch it and see for yourself."
4,"Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster or Godzilla # 5 as some may file it is a good entry in the long running series. I've never been a huge fan of Ghidorah in part because it seems to be more puppet than man in a suit monster so he has a lot less emotion than most of the other giant monsters from Japan. This is probably intentional as he is a mindless giant creature of destruction.This one is a bit talky for me. but we do get the first real monster team up here with Godzilla. Rodan and Mothra doing battle with the title monster. Lots of fun in this one once it gets rolling and this DVD edition from Classic Media does include both U.S. and Japanese versions of the film. This and many other Godzilla/ToHo titles are at bargain prices. so if you're wanting to add them to your collection. these are very nice editions."
4,"this movie was very entertaining and right to the point. you don't have to wait that long to start seeing the monsters and the human acting is very well done. the only problem is that the trailer is in japanese but the movie ended up being an english dub. i would much rather have watched it in it's original form with subtitles. which i feel would have been more authentic.  however. it was still good and the dialogue still came across pretty well. if you enjoyed mothra i would say to check this out. it was definitely enjoyable."
4,"This was one of my favorite in the series growing up. and remains one of the most significant overall in it being the first time Godzilla and Rodan appeared together. was the introduction of Ghidorah. still the best villain in the series. and (to my knowledge at least) was the first time an all out rumble between more than two monsters occurred.About the only bad thing I could really say about it is the manic nature of the fights does take away from the illusion of size. but that is a small complaint as that was one of the trademarks of the first generation of films in this series.This one is great fun all around."
4,"Usually the first movie is the best one. and here it is true.  Ghidorah was always my favorie film in the Godzilla series.  We have some great monster battles. well detailed sets for destroying. and get to see Ghidorah with the meanness he's meant to have. only otherwise seen in Destroy all Monsters.  Both versions are very clean both visually and in audio.  The dubbed version is probably the one we all grew up seeing... with a lot of the added in music which. I feel. adds greatly to the film.  This is the copy all Godzilla fans ought to pick up."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
4,"I am a big godzilla fan and I saw this movie as a kid. It's about a huge. three headed monster coming to destroy earth. And it's up to baby Mothra to convince godzilla and rodan to stop fighting each other and join mothra to defeat the 3 headed monster that the earth phrophecies said would arrive to destroy the earth. I liked this movie!  It's a lot of fun to see Godzilla.rodan and mothra baby  team up to defeat it. If you are a godzilla or monster movie fan give this movie a try.much recommended!"
4,"This is a great Godzilla movie. but there's just one scene in it that just prevents it from being a total success. The lead up to the climactic battle between the space monster Ghidrah and the defenders of Earth. Godzilla.  Rodan and Mothra is entertaining and fun. But then we have the scene in  which the three Earth monsters &quot;talk&quot; to each other when Mothra  tries to convince the other two to help he/she/it fight Ghidrah. There  could have been another way to do this scene. Even the post chat fight  scene between all the monsters is great. Re-work that scene and you've got  a film that is almost on par with the original &quot;Godzilla: King of the  Monsters&quot;"
4,"The Showa series is probably best known for it's cheesy entries. and this might be where it all began.  However. this does not mean it's some piece of trash. it's actually a decent Godzilla movie.  The story is pretty good. the monster fights are entertaining. it's an overall fun movie to watch.  To be honest. the only cheesy moments are when the monsters are on screen - if I'm not mistaken. this is the first Godzilla film to give the monsters human characteristics such as laughing. talking. silly hand gestures. etc. - but nonetheless. it's all good fun.  One of my favorites. and definitely worth adding to your collection."
4,"The original Japanese theatrical release is in pristine condition however Classic Media/Toho studios should have also cleaned up and remastered the American English dubbed version. That was annoying as one who would prefer to watch the American version and not have to concentrate on reading subtitles is distracted by the the uncleaned film print presented.The dvd also offers a couple of extra features which consist of stills of the monsters that star in the film and a biography(forgotten who).Stills include text and other film appearances of the monsters-with title and year given."
4,"Ghidorah (also known as 'Ghidrah' in the U.S. edit of the film) is a merciless three-headed dragon from outer space with the abilities to shoot lethal electric bolts from its mouths. and it will have to take the combined might of Rodan. Mothra. and Godzilla to defeat it! A very enjoyable movie. It starts out a bit slow. but once the film starts to get going. it has possibly some of the best and most exciting action scenes out of any Godzilla movie. With a really good story. four monsters. one of them Ghidorah - my favorite Godzilla villain. it's hard not to like this one. This film also features Godzilla's transition from bad guy to good guy and the last one in a long while to be taken mostly seriously. A great movie that would be a shame to miss out on.Highly Recommended!"
4,"One of my child hood favorite G-films released on a DVD of incredible quality. This DVD has even more special features than 'Mothra vs. Godzilla'. with an image gallery included. This time David Kalat was the `G-expert' selected for the commentary. I think he delivers an entertaining performance as he mainly focuses on the evolution of Godzilla from a serious villain to a campy and comical hero. He tells us his opinion on the matter and how it really affected the original series. The image gallery has some nice photos with captions and in the end another great classic media release."
4,"If you're a fan of Toho films then you have probably seen this talky monster film. While this release has a nice DVD transfer and print the film itself is slow moving with little monster action until the last 15 minutes. I remember Godzilla films fondly from my childhood. but this has never been one of my favorites. Sure it's got lots a monsters(Godzilla. Rodan. Mothra and Ghidorah). but they have very little screen time.The good news is this release has both the U.S. and Japanese version of the film with the Japanese version running about 6 minutes longer. There is a cool posters and stills gallery and a 7 minute documentary on FX master Eiji Tsuburaya. It's not the best in the series. but Godzilla fans should dig this release for sure!I posted this film release under The Invasion Of The Astro Monster by mistake and I will correct that review a.s.a.p. Ooop! ;-b"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
4,"It took a month for me to actually receive this film. I have been waiting for years to see this. the last Godzilla film I needed for my collection. I should have waited longer. Even if you don't mind that this is a cheap DVD-R bootleg of a shoddy print. or that the title is spelled wrong. or that the cover and label are ugly as sin... you should not buy it. Why? Because the last chapter of the disc doesn't play! You can't even watch the whole film all the way through. I have returned and replaced this disc twice already and they were all the same. I'm going to avoid all DVDs from &quot;Cine Vu&quot; from now on."
4,"I'm another one of those people who used to see daikaiju movies on Saturday matinee TV as a child. Close as I came to a couch potato and it made me really interested in Japan. I've been waiting so long to find these films given a proper digital conversion. The last few years have made me very excited (for an adult) as Toho has finally pulled the cork out of its uptight behind 15+ years into the digital revolution and allowed the west to see the Japanese-language widescreen versions of most of the Godzilla oeuvre without spending $$$ on an import.As usual. on Ghidorah. Classic Media has added some interesting short extras. I feel lucky. at this point. to even get to see the theatrical release. so my bias is very pro. but the price really is a no-brainer. isn't it?"
4,"This is a great movie (like most Godzilla movies). 100's of mederites crash on earth. A really big one hacthes(?) and turns and King Ghidorah is born. while Rodan and Godzilla fight each other in Tokyo. Meanwhile a princess claims she's a veusin and warns Earth about nermous dangers. On time she tell Japan that King Ghidorah will attack Tokyo ! So Mothra tries to convince Godzilla and Rodan to become good and fight King Ghidorah. They disagree so Mothra will fight by herself. Wacth the movie to find out what happend next. Its not as good as the last movie Mothra VS. Godzilla. But its still a awesome movie."
4,"Being a life-long Godzilla fan. I was excited when Classic Media said they would release Ghidorah: The Three-Headed Monster on DVD! Back in 1998. we got a VHS release of the movie for the first time in YEARS. The film was pan and scan and was discolored and grainy. Not the perfect print for such a classic but we really didn't complain much because we finally got a chance to own the film.Classic Media did a great job in bringing us a widescreen version of the U.S. release and the Toho Scope Japanese version! The coloring is great. the sound is wonderful. and there is considerably much less grain than on the VHS release a handful of years earlier!There are some nice extras on this DVD including a trailer. a poster slide-show. and film commentary! This film has just enough goodies on it to keep die-hard G-Fans entertained and satisfied! Highly recommended!"
4,"Well. the title explains it. The title is extremely pointless. Why? Why? Why? Why did Toho have to make such a stupid film???! There are some changes they should have made. First. aliens. Why aliens? It is waaaay to corny. Second. Ghidrah. Way did Toho make Ghidrah look like he was a drunken elf? Ghidrah didn't have to shake his legs. heads. and wings uncontrolably! And third. MAKE GODZILLA AND THE OTHER MONSTERS GOOD GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would've given this movie five stars if Godzilla wasn't good! That mistake made the rest of the Showa series dumb. In the later movies. Godzilla acts more like Barney than a giant monster."
4,"This was one of the best programs ever to be broadcast on either public television (which is saying a great deal given other legendary programs like I'Claudius. Poldark. and Upstairs. Downstairs) or the networks. The story centers on the return of a brash young surgeon from London to his native Manchester to tend his alcoholic father. In connection with his return he joins the staff of a local hospital and shortly thereafter falls in love with an older woman he met on the trip from London. (...) Reckless offers everything a discerning viewer could want: romance. drama. comedy. suspense. and even farce. Casting is ideal all roles are admirably played by skilled actors who understand precisely who their characters are and what they should be doing/feeling at every given moment. Don't miss this one or it's equally superb follow-up: Reckless. the Sequel."
4,"Robson Green and Michael Kitchen as two-thirds of a love triangle! I so enjoyed this production for so manyreasons. It's an intelligent and witty romantic comedy. Well written. well acted. well designed. I certainly enviedFrancesca Annis being fought over by two such extraordinarily appealing leading men. I bet if anyone asked her.she would remember this film series as being one of the highlights of her acting career. I only wish that bothRobson Green and Michael Kitchen had been given more opportunities to show this side of their talent.Great fun."
4,"...but somehow I managed to do it in this boxed video series. originally shown on BBC/PBS.  Francesca Annis's same-age doctor husband takes a young woman to his medical conference and the young doctor who works for him  makes sure his wife finds out.  This is because the younger man wants his  supervisor's wife for himself.  Naturally. the wife has to get even with  her husband and after all the young man is THERE....and so we go.  It's  compelling viewing as all of their lives come blasting apart.  I've just  bought the sequel. Reckless II. so I can keep apace of even more hanky  panky."
4,"This series. first shown on Masterpiece Theatre. has everything. including romance. comedy and sex. sometimes at the same time. All of the actors are wonderful. displaying perfect comic timing. The dramatic scenes are often poignant.The love story may be central to the plot. but the adventures of Anna and Owen touch the lives of their relatives. friends and business associates in unexpected ways. The settings range from city. to lush countryside to a working man's neighborhood  and pub. to a bustling hospital. There's lots of action as well as some incredibly steamy love scenes.Reckless is a series to watch more than once. I never tire of revisiting Anna and Owen and all the other characters."
4,"From the moment I saw the preview of Reckless on A&E I wanted to see it. I enjoyed it so much I wanted to get it on DVD. I was not disappointed with my purchases. The movies are clear and the commentary at the beginning builds your anticipation if you haven't seen the movie before. I also got the Sequel and I enjoyed it also. I saw so many angles in the story-plot. and I learned something from the story the four times I've watched it; I know I will be watching it many more times. I liked the relationship between Owen and Anna. and I disliked Anna's egotistical husband who deserved what he got!"
4,"Because this is one show I watched in the 90s and never forgot. I was grateful to find it on DVD now.  And there is a bonus of episodes from a follow-up series to the original. something I missed when it was aired.  Michael Kitchen is a riot. sublime in his comedic delivery.  The romantic leads are wildly hot.  All the supporting actors are perfectly cast.  There is one actor whose accent is so thick. I barely understand what he says; however. his acting is so clear. I totally get what is going on in his scenes.  There's a brief scene with a dog....  You don't want to miss any of this program."
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
4,"RecklessOkay. I admit to being more than a little prejudiced here.  I absolutely LOVE this DVD!  Even ten years on. it has all the charm. drama and poignancy of the first showing on Masterpiece Theatre.  It's the story of young Owen Springer. a cheeky (and sexy) doctor transferred to a Manchester hospital who falls in hopelessly love with an older woman (Francesca Annis) who just happens to be his boss's wife.Steller performances by Green. Annis. Michael Kitchen. David Bradley. Julian Tutt-Rhind and Connor Mullen take this comedy/romance/satire to a new level of entertainment.  Don't miss it or the sequel. also on this 4-disc boxed set."
4,"This is a fun miniseries featuring some of my favorite British actors. Michael Kitchen(The Hanging Gale. Foyle's War). Francesca Annis (Cranford). and Robson Green (Wire in the Blood). The plot concerns a love triangle that is a bit different from the normal love triangle.  For women of a certain age-ahem-it is a delightful situation to find a younger man chasing an older married woman.  Perhaps this sounds like a soap opera but I can assure this series is so much more.  The acting. the dialog and the laugh-out-loud antics of the principals make this a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. I have loaned this set to friends and they.too. have enjoyed it.  I recommend this series highly."
4,"This was a most entertaining DVD. It was a bit long and seemed if it was a made for TV special. Actually. it was in two parts which provided a refreshing break. The subject was a body found in an underground ice house. The mystery was whodunit. The likely suspects were all involved to some degree as they were seemingly living as a lesbian threesome and scorned by the local villagers. The story unfolded with all sorts of twists and turns. new developments. and enlightening forensic evidence that was only forthcoming at critical times in the story. There was a bit of romance between the suspect and investigating detective that made for an interesting story by itself. I felt like this was a pilot movie of a series that might be scheduled to follow. There were certainly many follow up stories that could be made. I was glad that I found this DVD and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys British mysteries."
4,"Less a mystery. more a study of human nature (everyone has a hidden agenda).  In this case. the police are decidedly suspicious before the facts.  A body is found and Chief Inspector Walsh (Corin Redgrave) desperately wants it to be a man who went missing (he presumes dead) years ago.  He goes to great lengths to ensure that everyone else jumps to the same conclusion. becoming increasingly prickly when the facts decide otherwise.  Daniel Craig plays Sergeant McLoughlin. who eventually learns the inconvenient truth.There are no sympathetic characters to be found as everyone is on their worse behavior.  I found it fascinating; it certainly kept my attention throughout.  I was. however. disappointed at the resolution and would never bother watching it again because of that."
4,"Are we Jaded? Rate this product. . . We EXPECT what we purchases to BE.  To work without difficulty. without oops. without interruptions. to provide the intended use. When we receive and get the EXPECTED. we might sigh a sigh of satisfaction. More often we might not even raise an eye brow. Then we do not give of that satisfaction to the seller for providing so much to our enjoyment.This movie was checked to be in excellent condition and valued to be Worth a price and worthy of giving entertainment.This movie was packaged securely to survive the transportation from safe storage to me.This movie was sent with confidence that it would arrive into my care quickly and safely.All this required a seller that paid attention to basic details. that produced a successful transaction for both the seller and the buyer.This brings buyers back to sellers again and again.I am a happy buyer and look forward to doing business with this seller again.Clear"
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
4,"The Woman in White 2014 release. 1997 vintage. 116min. and integrating to the end.Wilkie Collins Victorian mystery.  Half-sister nieces of Limmeridge owner Mr Fairlie (Ian Richardson -Becoming Jane) unravel a conspiracy that includes a mysterious lady in white gown & veil. Fairlie hires art tutor Hartright (Andrew Lincoln -Love Actually) for the girls. Laura and Marian. Justine Waddel (Wives and Daughters) plays Laura well in her first acting role. Tara Fitzgerald (Jane Eyre '06) is Marian. Sinister encounters. crime. secrets. and nightmares prevail through the summertime of young passions. All the while the insane illusive Woman in White comes and goes. day and night. but from where no one knows. Delightful film period perfection. down to the fine English houses. and a story with a surprise twist that was unexpected to me.SDH SUBTITLES are available on the 2014 release.Also available in the DVD set:Costume Drama Collection"
4,"The film adaption of William Wilkie Collins' THE WOMAN IN WHITE was horrible only in the sense that it failed to adequately portray the written word visibly.On the hand. the film version of the story was an entertaining piece of work.  It was well-acted. especially by Tara Fitzgerald (The Tenant of Wildfell Hall). though there seems to be a lack of explanation ofr character's interest in the story. such as Count Fosco.  It is a whirlwind sort of a film. not quite romance. nor adventure.The story follows two sisters and their artist tutor through the wiles provided by a duplicious baronet from the south country of England who seeks to woo the younger sister to take her money.  Faked death. burning alive. and triumphant love bring the characters to a more mature view of the world and closer together.  Despite literary accuracy. it was a fine motion picture."
4,"I say this because I have seen the 1948 black and and white version with Alexis Smith and Eleanor Parker.and also Agnes Moorehead.and it is a very.very good film and also deserves a dvd release..why it  has'nt been released yet I do not know.And there is even a longer version of this more like a mini series that came out in the early 1980's...I have not seen that one yet...But I imagine it would cover more of the book then maybe this one....But as for this one I really enjoyed it.it was done really well..and I also think that Andrew Lincoln has a better and more meatier role here then...when he played...that pathetic character Edgar Linton..because I personally can't stand the character of Edgar Linton...{especially the way Andrew Lincoln played him}...But in this role yes I really enjoyed him and the rest of the cast very well"
4,"Woody Allen's directorial debut. and it's still funnier than many of his later movies.  You know. he tended toward introspection over comedy in later years.  At the time I ordered. this import was the only widescreen version (zone 0) available in north america.  Sure. it has some korean styled packaging. but you still get english audio and subtitles.  The movie itself is is fresh comedy from a guy making a funny movie. not a commercial movie.  Beware. this movie contains prison scenes and carved soap."
4,"This is an early film (his first) of comedian /actor/director Woody Allen starring himself in the lead as Virgil Starkwell a bungling wannabe bank robber whose hijinks land him in prisons. in bed with a lovely girl and the halls of academia as an expert on crime. In this film we can see the outlines of Woody's seemingly endless love affair with early black and white crime and film noir classics. There is a little more use of sight gags here than in latter films but through it all Woody is still the funny bumbling New York Jewish kid that a long series of films will explore in greater detail. The use of an old time newsreel announcer to describe and set the framework of the film and detail the action is an interesting twist. Not the best Woody Allen film but a good look at the niche that he created for himself in American urban comedy/ social commentary cinema."
4,"This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product. I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.Further. ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio. but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed. it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola. I wouldn't have bought this doorstop. and humbly suggest that you don't either. Go with the1992 FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENTversion instead."
4,"This is one of those movies that Woody has his fans refer to in 'Stardust Memories'. and vicariously in 'Husbands and Wives'. as being early funny work--and funny it is as you'll laugh your way through nearly all of it.  Parts of 'Take the Money and Run' are as hysterical as 'Sleeper.' such as the shot where his gun turns to soap suds and when he morphs into a Rabbi.  Also of note is when he poses as a classical musician but can't place the name of Mozart.  This is happy. loose camp in the spirit of the Marx Brothers.  Rent it. buy it. do whatever. you can't go wrong with this one.  It's good clean fun."
4,"I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below. you MUST see the others: Love and Death. Bananas. Take the Money and Run. Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask. Anie Hall. Sleeper. A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !"
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
4,"This movie will make you laugh til you cry. it really is hilarious from beginning to end. Woody Allen is at his best in this film that he also directed.I'm giving it 4 stars as I did not like Janet Margolin as his girlfriend in this movie. thought a better choice could have been made to play this role. She seemed to be reading the lines throughout. not breathing any life into the role.Other than that. loved everything about this film. A great pick me up if you've had a bad day and need some big laughs. This one is a keeper!"
4,"This is a great Woody Allen film.However. it is only 85 minutes long. just like every other release.The description claims uncut 91 minute version. There is no extra material.It is widescreen. but I have to compare it side-by-side with a VHS version to acertain if making it widescreen cuts off the bottom and top of the picture.All special features are only written text and only in Korean. so virtually no special features unless you read Korean.Don't buy this because the description claims uncut version.It is not.It is. however. a really funny Woody film! Buy any domestic release."
4,"Presented as a mock documentary complete with narration by radio ham Jackson Beck. Allen's hilarious directorial debut is nuttier and loaded with more gags than his later. more sophisticated New York films. But that's exactly why it works: The laughs are goofy and often puerile. and for all the zippy one-liners that don't quite elicit a full-belly guffaw. Allen piles on with cutting satire (focused mostly on footage of presidents Nixon and Eisenhower). You'll have a lot of fun watching this manic genius at work in one of his earlier comedic efforts."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
5,"The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived. so it was even better than I had expected.As an added bonus. one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy. so for reminiscent's sake. I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording. :DIf you needed a pop filter. this will work just as well as the expensive ones. and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product! :]"
5,"I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins."
5,"I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano. which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion. a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals."
5,"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber. but other than that. the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that."
5,"Hosa cable quality can be all over the place. some of their products are good (sound good. reliable. long lasting) and some of their products are not good (affect sound negatively. break prematurely. short useful life span).These guitar cords are actually quite nice. they feel good (gooey soft rubber jacket like Mogami). they sound good and so far they are working reliably. the rubber jacket is about .25&#34; in diameter (by eye) and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug.I bought these when I needed cables fast for an internet concert. we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up. These cables arrived in good working condition and we've been using them continuously since.We have over a dozen tube amps and are very particular about sound degradation but so far these cables have not disappointed anyone.I would buy more if I needed them."
5,"I never really considered a cheaper cable. I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon. I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise. this is an excellent cable. with good build quality and a strong. thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables. and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm. guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over. try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!"
5,"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it. a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable. there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft"
5,"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones. where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire."
5,"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First. it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be 'gentle' with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second. the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable. heavy duty. and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!"
5,"On my mixer. I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip. return on the ring. and a common ground.  But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4' TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch. Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return."
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
5,"This is what it is... A super cheap mono cable. It should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven. Just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded. etc.For the price and intent. I almost gave it 5 stars. But it's not a 5-star cable... It's a fair quality ultra cheap cable. 4 stars seems about right. (Yes. this is almost exactly what I wrote about the other Hosa cable I reviewed.)"
5,"These little patch cables work nicely. there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..I'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. The product description says 6 inches. right? If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches. right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches. whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up.To conclude. would I recommend these? Yes. if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable. go for these. But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else."
5,"I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake. to change 1 channel into my monitor return. I plug an XLR to Female 1/4' stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. Now I can record with 6 channels. and monitor with 2. (It's an 8 channel XLR snake). Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake. and instead of buying another snake. why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter... :-P I love it. It's a great tool to add versatility to your setup. no matter what you're doing. Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4' stereo... It's high quality. and very solid. I definately expect this to last me a long time."
5,"I bought this XLR splitter to split the lead vocal from FOH to my monitor rack.  Used this way it worked great and I never had any problems with signal loss or power issues.  I began using a transformer isolated XLR splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter.  My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short. so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singer's microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground. or horizontally placed. but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand."
5,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it. plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack. Best Buys no where else. I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself. but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way. I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards.ffsalsa"
5,"This Dual splitter works perfect. I own a live event video company and I shoot a lot of weddings. The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say. half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though. the signal is to hot. the music is crap. or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time. This product has improved my productions beyond it's price sold. I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJ's wireless systems to my own audio recorder. They work perfectly and haven't failed me once."
5,"This was recommended to me by the top engineer at Genz-Benz bass amplification company.  Andy said that this product is far superior to any other.  He was right.  Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6.0 amp.  Also fixed the effects loop jacks. which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs.  Not good!  After several gigs worth of testing. both problems are resolved!  Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating. cleaning and coating effect on the components.  Wow!  And no. Andy does not own stock in. have affiliation with. or represent in any way the manufacturers of De-Oxit.  Nor do I."
5,"Back in the 1980's I bought a can of deoxit(not the right name but can't remember it) which worked much better and cost much less. It was made for the military. The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high. It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better. I don't see much else out there so I may have to stick with it.It is just very wasteful for the cost. I have had good luck with wd40 too. but it is very flammable. I would call it average."
5,"I deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars. basses. amps. FX. MIDI gear. etc.  Over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy / noisy pots (knobs). input and output jacks that are crackly. etc.In the past I've tried some Locktite electronics cleaner. which is provided in a similar can. It would rarely work.In contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear I've used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks. It's really like magic in a can."
5,"I bought this cable for my band's live show setup.  I bought it almost a year ago and still currently use it for the same application.  While not the best quality cable. the length and price make it a good value for the money. especially if you're buying several at a time.  I don't use these cables in the studio but for live. they're fine.  I'd recommend this cable if you're on a budget and looking to buy several at a time.  If you're only going to buy one. I'd look into Canare or Mogami. they're a little bit more expensive but easy to get and worth the price."
5,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables. and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g.. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell. and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them. and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies. so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
5,"I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900. It's a big step up from that one. I am pleased with it. The old one had a lot of handling noise. This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it. My next one will be an SM58. but that will be awhile from now. I'm very happy with this PG58.Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree."
5,"Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard. which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound. drums. congas. tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech. the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
5,"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't. it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic. I use it for instruments. vocals. even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals. but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned. and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably. then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon. but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics. you can't go wrong here."
5,"Great all around mic used for vocals.  No frills. tough as nails. and great sound for live music.  If you're buying your first mic (or switching from a cheapie) and intend to use it for singing/vocals. this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation.  I've never used another one since the first time I switched from a cheaper mic (that came with some bundle) 10 years ago.  I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly.  You can stand 3 feet away and really wail. or get up close for some bass response. or anything in between.The SM58-CN comes with the mic. 25-ft cable. cable tie. carry pouch. and mic clip.  The standard SM58 does not have a switch (one less thing to break and I don't miss it)  but the SM58-S does have it for a few dollars extra."
5,"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires. of course. the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them. I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience."
5,"I have one of these. as well as several other microphones. The SM58 is a good all around mic - the reason it's an industry standard/go-to. but the Beta 58A is a better (in my opinion) vocal-specific mic...basically giving (again. in my opinion) a higher quality sound. The SM58 by comparison sounds muffled/muddy. where the Beta58A is clearer. stronger. and more articulate. If you're used to the SM58. then the Beta58A can sound thin and harsh. but. that is adjustable at the board - end result is that it's a tighter sounding mic with more clarity.Pattern-wise. it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds - I play drums and use this mic for that reason. is that it picks up less of my drums than a SM57 or a SM58."
5,"I'm an amateur sound tech. We've been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we've had before. Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews. When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah.. For me. it sounded better than SM58. My songleaders have tested it and guess what... they dont want to use the SM58 anymore :)"
5,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Dano stomp boxes.  I probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make.  This pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs. but IMHO the tremolo from Dano's Cool Cat line is a much more durable pedal for only $4 more (at the time of this review).  The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link.  I don't think it's true bypass either.  The Cool Cat has a metal enclosure. true bypass. sturdier inputs and knobs. and a much better on/off switch.  The features and sound are the same.  Spend the extra $4 and you will have a much more bullet-proof pedal with the Cool Cat trem."
5,"Hey. it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several 'cheapo' pedals. and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic). at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound. not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough. it doesn't take up much space. it sounds great. and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND. if you are like the typical musician. you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
5,"I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one.  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine.  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!"
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
5,"I've played guitar for 5 years. Seen many different capos. but none that quite satisfies me as the Kyser.You really can't go wrong with this capo. It is very mobile. easily adjustable. sturdy. and durable.What's good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 String capo and still turn it around to use it asa Cut capo. The transparent rubber piece does the same job.It comes in different colors also.I own the black. silver. gold. and camo Kyser capos.I also own the Cut Capo for other styles.I recommend it!All the capos I've had from Kyser are still in great conditions.Use them all the time at church and at home"
5,"I don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo. but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos.  important to take it off when not in use so the 'rubber' does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another."
5,"Long time Shubb user. but decided to try something different.I think I've found how lazy I am. I ended up using the Kyser more often than the Shubb because of the fact that you can put the Kyser on the peghead.Reaching my hand to an always available position on guitars (i.e. the peghead) for the Kyser turns out to be much more convenient than reaching to something that is not on the guitar and that could change according to situations. e.g. maybe just by my side on the sofa in my living room. maybe a table or the floor in some other places. for the Shubb."
5,"I have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. The price is right for these. and they work just fine. My only real issue is that sometimes. they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you're going to bar. thus producing a sound you weren't looking for. Some of the higher end capo's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. However. like i say. these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard. and are from what i can tell. the most popular model on the market."
5,"I really like my capo. the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic. and it works as it should. However. I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product. For example. I think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer. and rounded (the back side of a guitar neck is rounded. after all). The spring could definitely be tighter...I do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough. Also. the design is fairly nice. but it's mostly aesthetic...it's not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily.Don't get me wrong. this is a rather good product. and it's priced about right. It just isn't a high end product/5-star perfect."
5,"This is my third pack; the 1st pack has been using for two months. the sounds are rich and full. and the feels are still good.  I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing. and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time.  So. I want to keep a completed pack for back up.  I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently. sometime. i will practice for 4-5 hours+ until i'm tired for the session.  I have used light steel strings on my acoustic. but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter."
5,"I am yet another one of those 'Forever Beginners' when it comes to playing the guitar. Never mind that...these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better! After putting in new pegs and re-stringing with these strings...it sounds so much nicer! More richer! Now I see I need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose. I think that once I do this and then re-string these same strings on it...I will be set to go!I like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of years...let's face it...my fingers get sore when playing! I also have small fingers and hands.I intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use.I recommend!"
5,"I bought this pick holder because I hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you can't play with a pick in your strings. I originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock. Boy was I wrong. The picture is misleading.  This thing is tiny and barely goes across three string. It wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks (maybe more if they are thin) into the wedges on top. Stays in place well and is very convenient.Only negative is I don't know how long it will hold up. I think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better. I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks."
5,"Not too much to say. it's made out of foam. made to slip between the strings. made to hold two picks.  I have several of these. for acoustics and for electrics.  My son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won't be dislodged. still. it does stay on majority of the time.  I do recommend this.  My son's guitar teacher calls this a 'fancy little pick holder' and I've had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time.  One must also be careful. my son lost one of these so I know it is a possibility of it falling off.  He lost it after performing in a play on stage.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
5,"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar. as I often find myself playing with fingers. then suddenly a 'pick song' starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it. and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick. but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it. but the 'spreading strings' on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So. still highly recommended if your headstock has a 'straight through' design. not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )"
5,"I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick. Worked. but it was difficult getting all three picks in one Wedgie so I ordered a second one. Between the two of them. between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut. works pretty good holding these types of picks (which admittedly. the Wedgie was not actually designed for). Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (haven't tried it yet). But otherwise. worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around. Especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself (real help to me staying organized!)."
5,"I have been playing guitar for over 30 years. I've owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime. My wife bought this guitar for me as a gift. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this guitar. It is a solid. well built guitar. The finish is beautiful. The pictures do it no justice. It sounds incredible. It has great tone and sustain. wonderful harmonics. The clean tones are nice and warm. The neck is fast. No fret noise or hums. The pickups are really nice. Its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it. From blues to hard rock & metal. I would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat. You cannot find a better guitar for this price. I would have expected it to cost much more. I am extremely impressed with this great guitar. You can bet. when I add the next guitar to my collection. it will be another epiphone. Well done Epiphone!!"
5,"I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. After doing research. reading reviews. and checking it out in a guitar store. I chose this one.It's much easier to play than the Squier. and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad). it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted. but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.It's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman. and I really like that the neck is smaller. It's also fairly lightweight.Overall. I'm happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe. I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again."
5,"First off. the shipping was fantastic. It shipped the very next day and came VERY well protected in perfect condition. It is an extremely well made and solid product. I think a few people have given this Les Paul a rep of just being a 'Starter Guitar'. Trust me when I say. I have no problem leaving my Les Paul Standard at home and taking this one to a gig. It plays well and the sound?? INCREDIBLE. It even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp. I can't say enough good things about this guitar it's that good. If you're thinking aout buying this guitar. don't. Just buy it!! BUY IT!!"
5,"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar. only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs. which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing. it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson. but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!"
5,"Listen.If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability. buy this one.  Period.I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work. in case the guys called for a practice session. so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.I have other. way more expensive guitars. like a Gibson ES-335. Dean 12 string. and a Fender Strat. but I gotta tell you. I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.And if it gets banged up. so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes. just for a cheap change up guitar.Dig it."
5,"I'm updating a previous negative review. I had some issues with this guitar when it arrived. I couldn't get it setup. the action was very high and I couldn't set the intonation. Notes at the 12th fret were very sharp. and I couldn't lower them with saddle adjustments. I missed one vital checkpoint. the bridge needed to be lowered. Setup is finished. and I can now agree with most reviewers. For the price. this guitar is far better than any others in the price range. I know my grandson will enjoy it. at least for awhile. If it ends up as a dust collector. I'm not out much on the purchase price. I'll add it back to my own collection. and upgrade the electronics."
5,"I got this guitar at Guitar Center. i was scared to get this guitar from amazon because of a review saying it looked like a toy. so i wanted to see it in person. i saw it. i tested it out at guitar center and it was amazing. its better than my other les paul special ii. this guitar plays great. its set up very nicely. the pickups are very nice. the electronics work perfectly. i have no problems with it. but the guitar is very beautiful. i would highly recommend getting it. i just dont know if anyone elses will be the same. not all guitars are made the same right?"
5,"A long time Planet Waves user I trusted that the circuit breaker cable would be up to their usual high standards... IMHO it is not.The plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip. I like their old cables that had a long cable protector extending from the plug allowing the cable to flow gracefully from the guitar (and into the amp at the other end). The actual cable is horrible.... it is a hard plastic outer shell and does not lie or flex well like a good cable should (e.g. like my old Planet Waves cables do). They claim that the shielding is excellent but I find it to be mediocre. Very disappointing purchase."
5,"I purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago. and have always loved it. I only use 3-4 pedals. and this is always one of them. It sounds great. is indestructable. and takes up almost no space. The controls are great. and you can get a large variety of sounds. I have played 'boutique' chorus pedals. and the Boss is loads better in every way. You will not regret this purchase.Pros:-easy to use-no hum-small-sonds awesome-indestructabecons:-NONEIf you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever. will last forever. and sounds incredible. get this."
5,"OK... I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but. I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!"
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
5,"I have had this pedal for about 15 years. just replaced the old one a month ago. It distorts sound. not quite the way you would imagine though. This effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color. I use it through a Epiphone Valve Jr and a Marshall 2x12 stack with JTM45 on top and its fine. This thing through a Champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a EQ pedal.This does just what it says it does. One Volume knob. one tone. and one distortion knob. CRANK IT."
5,"This is a distortion pedal. It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl. It's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion. The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp. You can dial the tone in. but it's a pretty harsh sounding.That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to. My amp gives me a nice warm crunch. classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound I wanted. and it does so flawlessly.It took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1. It's BOSS. so it will last forever.Th only drawback is that it's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere. Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing. but word to the wise. don't pay more than $40 new for this thing."
5,"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise. it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass."
5,"I know. I know. many people hate on this pedal. calling it &#34;stale&#34;. and &#34;generic&#34;. The problem that they have is that they simply haven't found the right settings on the pedal and the amp. because. after all. the settings on both the amp. and the pedal do make a difference. One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. I have a Digitech Bad Monkey. and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. With this pedal. I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone."
5,"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal. you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount. if necessary) and more tone control. but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range."
5,"I've had this for about 11 years now. Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market. this pedal still sells well. Not to mention. it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They're usually on the side of improving the stock tone. which I'm happy with.I've always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music. the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain. I punch it up with an overdrive. or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost. I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter. more technical styles. it's better not to have too much gain anyhow."
5,"To be honest. I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet. but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great. only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock. or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp. but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
5,"I have a lot of pedals...  In fact. I have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals (though only the MT2 and the OD3 are regularly in my rig.)  This pedal won't give you a 'cranked up tube stack' sound.  No...  Instead. it's very edgy and smooth as can be.  It has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone.  I usually use it as a mid-boost for solos.  You'll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you won't be able to replicate (easily... I'm sure the huge Boss distortion box comes close. but for the price...) with any other pedal."
5,"Its a great pedal. sound really crunchy. I got a peavy vyper sometime I use this If I want a crunchy style. but the amp I got is really good and has its own distortion styles. I use the heavy metal config on this pedal. I recomend it to anyone... does not introduce noise. I run it on the stock battery. it still works. you can make your guitar sound like Metallica or Megadeth. of course it also depends on a lot of things. like pickups. amp. etc.... I also have a very old little peavey practice amp. this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life.Listen to it on the Boss website. I heard to it and then I thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them. but it does sound really really close. regards. forgive my english... not from the U.S"
5,"This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years.  It really does have a ton of range. although it only does one effect at a time. so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock. which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.  If you want any of those 90's sounds. excluding the heavier metal sounds. this pedal will definitely get you there."
5,"I first used this pedal when my green screemer died. A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed. I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end. my search ended with this pedal. I highly recomend this pedal to any rock. blues. metal. country. or punk guitar player."
5,"Forget all the volume drop comments.  There isn't any and it does not color your tone one bit.  I have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals. They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in.  I wanted something to dress up slow ballads. and of course 'Born On The Bayou'.  This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it.  And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on. I play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it."
5,"I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. I'm old school. Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles. this pedal has a great. warm. organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot. You can barely bring it in for some warmth. or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound."
5,"This is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] Its dials allow for enormous control of the effect. [2] It's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of BOSS pedals. Further. [3] it's utterly easy to use. [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation. and. most important of all. [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo. (Note: It comes with a 9v battery installed. but it does NOT come with a power source/adapter.) If the price is more than you're willing to pay. consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO. This also delivers good tremolo. but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the BOSS product; it's still quite good. but the BOSS takes the prize. I paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"As stated in the title. this adapter is what you need if you use your Danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries. You can now plug it into the wall! As advertised. it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so I've owned it. The reason I took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesn't seem too durable. so because of this I have been very careful so it doesn't get broken. You might be able to find an off-brand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the Honeytone so you won't risk ruining it."
5,"My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal 'open' to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix. Classic. and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore. It's cry baby all the way"
5,"I've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now.  Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way.  Well. I've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect.  Also. you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little 'comb' that moves the wheel on the pot.I've tried other wahs.  Morley doesn't do it for me. and the Vox is very good. I just have always gone with what I knew.  No complaints with the Crybaby."
5,"MY experience with crybaby is it has a great tone.  More overbearing than the Vox or cleaner wahs.  BUT I know several people who have had problems with the switch. and I have watched countless others stomping on their crybaby in futile attempts to engage or disengage the pedal.I actually use a BBE and Vox since this frustration with my 1st wah.  But I am not sure that I am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance!  I kinda think I am.  The VOX and BBE seem to have a brighter sound which is less 'wah-ed' if you will.  It could be accentuated by me playing a Strat instead of the Les Paul Custom/Boogie combination I used with the crybaby."
5,"My Cry Baby is about 20 years old and is the oldest pedal on my board. I have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the Potentiometer to give the Wah a broader range but it really doesn't sound any better. This pedal covers the &#34;White Room&#34; by Cream Tone perfectly. I gave it 4 stars because it hasn't been maintenance free. The pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives. I probably should give it 5."
5,"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on. which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch. so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle. and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah. but in my experience. the sound is equivalent on the base models."
5,"this is my first petal of  any kind.  I had read that the Wah shoud be your first so I went with that.  glad I did.  this Wah petal is so much fun.  you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow.  It is hours and hours of fun.  the sounds are great.  I have had no problem with performance.  it works as it should.  I highly recommend this petal.  it's price is attractive as well."
5,"Some things just don't need to change. Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz. eq. or other wacky add-ons but WHY? I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great. The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style; everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal. It's a must have and that's really all there is to say."
5,"I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards.  But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal. it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable.  I suspected that the potentiameter was shot. so I had that replaced. but the same problems reoccurred.  Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product. but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had."
5,"This is for theKyser Banjo/Mandolin CapoThis is one of three capos I use for a ukulele.  It works. and is my second favorite.  I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele. and it is easy to add. move. remove. With the trigger-type release. it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards. and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo. Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.  UPDATE:  I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime.  Free shipping for Prime members!!!For the price and quality. this Kyser capo works on a uke. Highly recommended."
5,"You can never go wrong buying a Kyser capo.  They are made to last and really do what they are designed to do.  The great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so I don't have to have a seperate capo for each.I also have a capo for guitar made by Kyser and I can tell you that works just as well.  You can never go wrong with a Kyser.  Not only that I like the idea that it's an US company.  I've had some cheaper capos and they just don't do the job.  They either don't press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much.  This Kyser will last a long. long time."
5,"I've been using one of these Kyser's for a good while now. I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo. If you never used one. it's makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when I'm playing chords. when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on. With a little practice you'll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz."
5,"In particular. I favor the Dual Design. Why? If the need arises. it's possible to use a regular strap that doesn't have the button locks installed. I have two of the black ones on a 7 string Ibanez RG7321. and Laguna LE200QBC guitars. I have spare straps for both guitars. and sometimes I lock those spares with the plastic Dunlop discs.I have some older bass guitars with similar Dunlop locks (the standard version). two of which had locks installed in the mid 1990's. and one from 2003 with the gold DD. All three of them have held up with no issues. I didn't need to re-tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago. Then again. I don't tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as ... MetallicA. ;)"
5,"So I bought these because being Dunlop. I trust the brand. I dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky. The only problem I have is. they scare the piss out of me. Its not a 'tighten washer and nut' situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks. These have pegs that insert. Its so hard for me to trust these. I always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp I clench my guitar. So scared that the little metal balls things will just slip. peg fall out and ruin a $500 guitar. I havnet had a single problem with this system yet. and I never hope that I do. But if it happens there will be an update to this. Good product so far. just wouldn't recommend it. There is too much crap in the world to be worried about. strap locks shouldnt be one of those things."
5,"they work well. For me. the instalition wasn't that hard. it took me maybe four or five minutes. The screws provided were a bit bigger than my BC Rich Avenge Beast's stock strap system. BUT when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap (or wax- i used the bar soap though) the installation becomes easier.Once you put your strap in. its NOT comming out unless you try hard to undo the system. lol.If you need to clean your guitar strap. take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip. Its a quick and harmless way to do it and it may take about a minute or two to undo both strap locks. Its not that hard though and the reward is worth it."
5,"No complaints about this hardware.  Easy to install with patience. easy to use.  The click on/off system securely holds your strap. and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post.These work like a light switch...on/off. so I'm not sure how you can rate them as poor.  There aren't really any directions. so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.Quality metal. secure function. and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.I've installed these on a 3/4 Hoener. Full Sized Squire Acoustic. and 2 Fender Strat's."
5,"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops. and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past. on friends' guitars. semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast. these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still. the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes. making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch. using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system. and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar."
5,"The very first thing I noticed about the design is how far from the guitar's surface the strap is actually connected.  What this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitar's weight.  The &#34;fulcrum&#34; is the surface of the wood. if this makes sense. and I can't help but wonder if it could eventually (eventually over much time and use) cause cracks or splits as a result.I found someone selling only the Dunlop strap buttons. which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars. and was about to order them when I found Planet Waves Elliptical End Pins.  I think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap. unless you're going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders. and no additional stress on the guitar's body.  I've ordered a set."
5,"I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy.  I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago. and I dont recall having this issue. so I'm thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point.  I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle. and the locks are secure.  However. due to this issue. I'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks.  I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon."
5,"I'm in love with the dual design system! It works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly. There is one downside to this system. as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself. Which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap. There was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time. One component. which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions weren't much help either. The directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go. but I didn't know the name of the piece nor could I readily find it in there. After that. I installed this into my new guitar and strap and. I was ready to go. I HIGHLY recommend this! It is much easily to switch out straps w/o the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process."
5,"I replaced the Schaller strap locks on my Strat with these. The Schaller ones ground on the connecting hardware to the point where I had to oil them a few times a month or I'd end up with an audible creak.Hands-down I like the Dunlop ones more. They installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure. No problems whatsoever. I just ordered my third set a few minutes ago.I'm a total convert - every new guitar I get is going to get a set of these put on it."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
5,"I don't know if this is a common problem. but i have these on both of my basses. and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing. like metal does before it rusts. it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose. and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product. this was just one of those things i think. so I would still recommend it."
5,"I like this strap lock very strong very sturdy! Keeps things in place.. one problem.. The coating will wear out in a short time (a few months) and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside. This might make it a bit hmm I don't want to say hard to lock. but you'd better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure. Mine has un-clipped a couple times because I didn't check. Our climate is humid so it's rust friendly which could contribute to why I'm having issues. However once clipped properly you shouldn't have issues! Great buy"
5,"Strings are half the battle with stringed instruments. A bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful. and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better. Either way. stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point. These strings make my cheap ukulele sound not-so-cheap. and I imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point. I also play guitar and Martin is one of my choice brands for strings so I figured they wouldn't let me down when I decided to play the ukulele - I was correct."
5,"I've been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess I own a quiver full of the addictive things (ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between). Over the years. I've tried several different brands of string. The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them. It's just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone. Given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel. the Martin string set's relatively low cost is a nice bonus."
5,"When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording.  Once these are in position they work just fine. the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks.  The device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it.  The filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where I wanted it and to keep it there.On the plus side. the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use."
5,"I ordered this product to use for personal recording. and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it 'New.' and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First. the package was stapled. that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then. to make matters worse. there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new. I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone. I would not recommend buying from this seller."
5,"This is a decent pop filter. It gets the job done but it has a few flaws. It attracts a good amount of dust. the screen tends to mess up (which caused me to tear the first screen). & the goose neck tends to unwrap it's self out of place. It also gets shakey so I tend to have to screw it back in. Other than that. it's a decent pop filter but not for the price. Under $10 would've been better. I should have went with something cheaper than $20 *cough cough* the Auphonix pop filter *cough cough* but. I will in the future."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
5,"For the price. this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However. there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that. if I pick up the mic. the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once. but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
5,"Well thought out unit that does what it says it will. drop all that POP! I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand. And being that it is rubberized. it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent &#34;give.&#34; And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer. allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing! And then; and now for the really important part: everything stays where you last left it. Hell. even my cats can't do that. and they're porcelain."
5,"After suffering through crackles. lost signals. and all the rest. I decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the Spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through Amazon.com.  Because the new acoustic-electric classical I received as a gift has an end-pin outlet. I bought the Spectraflex with the right angle connector.  Although I have been using the cable for only a few weeks. I am very impressed.  The connections on all the guitars and basses on which I've used it are sure. with no loss of signal. no crackles.  Perhaps most impressive is the fact that I can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal.  Finally. I can be confident that when I play. something will consistently come out of the amplifier.  By the way. the old-school tweed look is a plus. too."
5,"Well. what can I say? Based on the customer reviews. this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. However. after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). And before you ask. &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;. all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. So it is definitely the cable :(Anyway. I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120."
5,"Spectraflex makes great cables. I bought this right angle 10' red cable for my older Ibanez guitar. This cable is built to be extremely durable. is made in the USA. and comes with a lifetime warrantee. The 20 gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable. and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial (especially compared to a cheaper Fender cable I had been using that required almost constant tightening.) Though Spectraflex cables are not the least expensive (nor the most expensive.) they are a great value and I am definitely a fan. I recommend this cable without reservations."
5,"I purchased three of these (three different colors) to make a mini-snake for my keyboard to their Di's.  I typically used Mogami 2524/Neutrik. but need cakes while in the road (I usually roll my own to exact length).  These have worked well. quiet. no handling noise. seem well built (I treat cables well. so I don't really test them with under tough circumstances) and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future.  They are used 6 nights a week. and after 50 uses. no problems.  I recommend them (plus. for live. the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well.).  Nice pieces..."
5,"I keep this cable on my pedal board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case. I've posted a photo on the pedaltrain Mini page. The right angle connector is great to exit the last pedal on the board and the straight connector goes into the amp. I use a Mogami silent cable -Mogami Platinum Guitar 12. Straight to Straight with Quiet Plug 12 feet- for the input to my guitar. but I can't justify paying a LOT more money for the side that goes to my amp (it's not getting bumped around. plugged and unplugged. etc.). This cable works perfect for it's purpose. Oh yeah... and it matches my tweed amp!!"
5,"Might work well for recording too when you take the output jack.  Speaker is acceptable quality but can't be compared with a Fender amp as this one has 5 watts and a small speaker and the other has 10-20 watts.  I'm opting for the convenience of the size.  I got this after getting a couple smaller amps and headphone monitor plugs since it has both and was better sound with good effects.  I like the 'brit' setting.  I sound like a rock star with it.  Good product for practice or recording.  You could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig.  But for around the same price you could get a Fender amp.  This product works for me and the quality is pretty good.  Other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this."
5,"This pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries.  We've used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up.  We are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it.  We are using an mp3 player for backup.  The sound is not quite as clear as we get with our Roland Cm-30 (so only 4 stars from me).  The micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it's nice not to have to load up cart to roll around.  Guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features."
5,"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes. but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician. I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics. mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining. I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169. you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up. I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me. a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little."
5,"Now-a-days I just search amazon because they have always got what I want at reasonable prices. This is no exception. I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. This was was better then I expected. It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit. In other words great all around. I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected. and it is lockable (with key)If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one. You will not be disappointed.Also. I ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day. No special shipping. Maybe it is my locations but that was great too. Well packed."
5,"This case it built really well. it has really nice plush interior... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck. it DOES have a lock on one of the latches. The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it. Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key... so dont worry. Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it.Above all it fits my Epi LP perfectly... as it should! hehe."
5,"As the title states. this is a lightly padded duffle bag. nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor. it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult. so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs. dings. dent & dirt. but that's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price."
5,"Well constructed with quality woods. saddle/nut and bracing. Neck and frets are straight. level and do not snag. This guitar rings like a bell. stays in tune and is light weight. Do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes. Any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play. The strings may be too high or too light or whatever. just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well. Do not buy a Luna. Davidson. Main Street. or any other 'no name' - get this one."
5,"I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em!!!!"
5,"Didn't think I'd be compelled to review something like a guitar pick. but the Dunlop Ultex has really impressed me thus far.  I use the .60 thickness. which is equivalent to the orange plastic Dunlop pick.  The orange pick is my favorite for acoustic and most electric playing. but they do wear down and fray on the edges. and have a little more friction that I'd like.This Ultex seems very resistant to wear and has surprisingly little drag over the string.  I find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold.  It gives just enough to use for smooth strumming. while being rigid enough for individual notes.Some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use.  If that turns out to be a problem. I might reconsider my review.  But out of the box. they perform as well as any pick I have used!"
5,"I like the fact that it can be &#34;partially&#34; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole (which will have to be enlarged a bit).  Either way. once plugged in. it sounds great.  This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar. a Blueridge BR-160.  I installed some Fishman &#34;under the saddle&#34; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good. if not better.  If you don't mind the pickup visible in the sound hole. this is the way to go.  Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar."
5,"Ok. so I just installed these things for my KRK 6's (no stands...just sitting on two other speakers).  What can I say?  The bass. which previously had disappeared in my studio. is now present again!  My monitors sounded kinda thin before because I was losing so much energy to my desk. but these things have made a ton of difference!  My stereo image even feels wider now!Sure. they're a little pricy. but hey...THEY WORK!  If that's what they want to charge for them. and people continue to buy them. I'm cool with that!  I'm happy with the reults my $40 got me!5/5!"
5,"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40. you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these."
5,"Some will argue that these are not necessary for your monitors. however as somebody who has worked in music for more than half their life. I can assure you that. whereas they're not life or death. they do make a significant improvement on the listening process. especially in your project studio. No. they're not going to make your music sound any better. but they will give you a more detailed and accurate bass response when your monitoring. Even cooler is the fact that the pads come with 2 extra pieces of padding that will essentially let you customize the position of the monitors in that you can angle them up or down ever-so-slightly. Lastly. although my monitors fit perfectly on the pads. I can't help but to think that if my monitors were any larger. I would need a second pair. especially if they were positioned horizontally. All and all. overpriced or not; they really make a world of difference."
5,"Long story short. this string set has a strong metallic character. which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it. but for me. absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar. so by its nature it sounds mellow. warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out. I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position. WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes. it is that bad. you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line. I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so. definitely avoid this string."
5,"I've been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time. I started playing 15 years ago. and used the slim. floppy picks for a long time. As time went on and my guitar skills grew. I needed a pick that was sturdy. and wouldn't flex to play more intricate and detailed songs.The tortex purples are my favorite. and they're the thickest ones I can find. I like the soft sandy feel of these. They don't slip out of your hand easily. and because they're so thick. they take a long time to wear out."
5,"Yes.  The 1.0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack.  If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop. the Tortex Picks are all color coded!Anyway. I've been playing guitar for about 15 years.  I've been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14.  At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.  Teardrops were too small; Fender brand were too slippery; Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly; the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me.  The 1.0mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack. don't feel too flimsy in my fingers (I keep a tight grip) and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market (gator grips feel too porous for me.)  Durability wise. I'll lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out!"
5,"I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition."
5,"I always keep a lot of these on hand.  These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals).  Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks.  These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used.  For example. I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks.  The weight is great for my style of playing.  They seem more durable than other brands.  They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand.  I love 'em. use them daily. and rely on them !!!"
5,"As a kid I learned to play the trombone proficiently. but my heart wasn't really in it. so I took up the guitar. which I love. I played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time. I recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock (I have an old Ibanez and a Les Paul Custom) and have tried several picks in that quest. There are several I have liked (and several that I haven't) but thus far my favorite is the 1.0mm Tortex (blue) picks. They have a very nice. almost powdery. matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just don't break. though the 1.0s are fairly stiff. Depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available. and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences. I won't say that I will never try anything else. but thus far I find myself picking up my 1.0 Tortex more than other picks."
5,"I absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks! They are so grippy. I haven't broken a single one yet. they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio. so it's hard to loose them. but I still do. If you have like a child. nephew. niece. sibling. or parent that plays guitar or bass you can't go wrong with getting these for them. or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little Fender picks that break if you strum a chord. and if you are lucky enough not to break them. they just slip out of your hands while you're playing. They are a little thin for rhythm playing however. and I recommend the .88 mm picks for that."
5,"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less 'clicky' - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same. I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point. so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop. they sound and feel just right to me. and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks."
5,"Ever since I started playing the guitar. I've used the nylon Dunlop picks. They're better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick. They're flexible and easy to pick with. but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break. You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them. as you can get them at your local music store for about that."
5,"I like thin picks myself. and this one is VERY thin. You won'tuse it all the time. but every now and then it can be used in the right situation. If you are a player who is somewhat meat-fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off. it is ideal. Also. if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar. it is awesome. No power chords with this little guy. but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it. The non-slippery texture and it's grippy textured surface of Dunlops is what I love about them the most. it makes them easier to hold on to. I give them a thumbs up!"
5,"They're very thin nylon picks. They're good for practicing the hand motions of strumming; they put up very little resistance. so they train you to keep your hand stable. I still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone. but I usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums. I also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking. since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don't notice with a thicker pick.They're great for what they are (thin. flexible picks). and Amazon has the best price."
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career.  I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks."
5,"Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn. nicked. picks. Rapidly.firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick. repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice."
5,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin. but for more chord strumming style playing. such as playing rhythm. the .73's are perfect. They are flexible. but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However. they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So. i dont see how you can go wrong."
5,"OK. so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything. depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However. I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw. folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
5,"alright I got tired of forking over 30 cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online. and let me tell you. these picks get the job done. don't expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that. a few of the tips broke off but I think that's my fault for playing too hard :) Great picks. would recommend to anyone."
5,"I use the Dunlop .60mm nylon picks as my current standard.  but decided to give the lighter .38mm a try.  Unfortunately.  the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar (especially in an outdoor picnic setting).  and basically unusable for that purpose.  However. I did find these were just the ticket for personal practice. allowing me to hear a  metronome or backtrack far easier.  So although they failed my original performance intention. 5 stars for filling a need I didn't even know I had.  :)"

5,"I think many/most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try.  My favorite picks for the last ~8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - they're nylon picks that have a raspy 'cat's tongue' surface that makes it super easy to grip.I've also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit. but they're not my favorite.  I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic.  These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them.  Sound-wise I don't find that they're significantly different from any other pick.  If they ever stop making Brain Picks these could very well become my #1."
5,"I'm glad I tried these. I wont order them again. I thought they might be a good alternate for my Dunlop nylon picks. not really though.Edit: Im nothing if not fair. My last review of these was in the context of my playing my Strat or sometimes my 335. I stand by that review. However. now Im playing my Godin 5th Ave and suddenly these picks are perfect. Ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars. In the end these are the picks I reach for when Im playing the Godin.I will buy these again. I changing my review from 'Just Okay' to 'Contextually Perfect'. Ok I'll add a star. your right I should add a star. There!"
5,"I've been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip. the right string resonance for strumming. and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest I've found so far for my style of playing. I'm a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely. strum more softly. and still get enough clarity and volume. I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking - they're very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks. For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal."
5,"First. I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.  I have dozens of them. they never wear out.  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band. and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable. and easy to control.Now the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself. but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable 'plinking' sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you're playing is loud music. this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics. because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.So. too bad.  I think these are great picks. but I'd like them to be made of a softer material."
5,"I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick. but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This. of course. can be very annoying. especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto. great for leads. and because of the way they are shaped don't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost."
5,"These  picks  R awsome!  I have tremmors  in my  hands  and have a hard thime with pick control.....They Have a Gell  center.  Whitch  tingles.  It feels like muscles are activating in Your Hand  GREAT THERAPUTIC PICKI seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks.These  picks have a indentation so U know where put UR thumb and index fingerThey really Do what they say....If U have hand problems.  try these.....they really work."
5,"When I first got them. I thought that they were going to be cheap. as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging. but it was ok. I wasn't expecting much from them. The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material. They did not bend at all when I tried to (and believe. me I tried). Pick wearing is virtually non-existent. and I utilize Alt-Picking a lot in my practices. I actually learned my first sweep shred (D major) with these picks within a day of getting them.I highly recommend for the shred guitarist.My only complaint. is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do (becuase of the grip) but i got used to it rather quickly.IMPORTANT!!!You can get these in 24 packs at [...] for only $10!!! Free shipping as well!Sorry. Amazon. but that is just to good a deal to pass on..."
5,"These picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone.Unfortunately. these picks did not receive a five-star rating because of their price and lack of durability.  They wear down fast.  Mine are usually worn out after a day of use and I don't think I play particularly hard.  At around $4.50 for six picks. these are some expensive pieces of plastic.However. these picks are so full of awesome that I am compelled to pay a little extra.  I will definitely be buying more."
5,"I first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks. The product description didn't mention that. but I was pleased to receive more than three!My son told me he needed some new picks. and since lately he's been playing Ozzy Osbourne songs I knew he needed a better pick than the standard Fender picks he's been playing with for three years. After hearing him play with these picks. I've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level. My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks. I wish we could choose the color. or maybe they could send a color assortment. We'll be buying these for a long time to come."
5,"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy. sharp almost. After playing a bit. the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually. it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice. you won't care."
5,"As a beginner guitarist. a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks. partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully. that makes sense).  However. when I was handed one of these. it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say. now that I have my own guitar. I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
5,"I've been playing guitar my entire life. And I've tried almost every pick there is. After hearing how great it is. I decided to buy it. It felt really small at first. and i kinda was dissapointed. I put it down. and didn't use it for quite some time. For some reason i decided to pick it back up. and after a few minutes i came to like the pick. Days after using it. i got accustomed to its size. and I became much more efficient with picking. And I no longer had to worry about the pick slipping. I can't really go back to normal sized picks now.. haha. That's like the only downside I can think of. There are many dif versions of this style. so buy em all. and try em out. If these don't work for you. you can always buy the V-pick."
5,"just to let people know off the bat i can tell you these picks are small. and if you are used to big picks these might turn you off for a while. But trust me when i say that once you get used to these picks and you start using proper technique these picks will improve your technique rapidly.i never thought i would say that a pick helped me improve playing but it does. now when i try any bigger pick i even use those picks with more skill now because of these picks. trust me if you put up with these picks for a while and you get used to them you will improve or at least i and many other people agree. :D"
5,"I like Dunlop products I used the purple tortex 1.14mm almost exclusively until I met up with this Jazz III.  And now my personal debate continues...  I like a thick pick and this Jazz III is.  I like tortex and this isn't but...I really like the orange color which makes it easy to locate if you drop it.  I rarely and I do mean rarely drop a tortex pick but this nylon might get a bit slick at times.They make 3 or 4 picks in this line with varying degrees of tip pointiness.  I like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips.This is the new and improved jazz style pick and I am still trying to figure out if I like this or the trad Fender jazz pick.  Or perhaps having a few slightly different picks laying around isn't such a bad idea after all."
5,"I bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out.  The 'gel' in the name sounded intriguing.  These are OK. the colors are bright. but otherwise they're just standard plastic picks. which on an electric I prefer nylon because it's less 'clicky' on the strings.  These are fine. and if I pull one out of my gig bag I'll use it. but overall there are other styles of pick that I'd buy before buying these again.  Nothing wrong with them. but they're just normal plastic picks. nothing special other than maybe the brightness of the colors."
5,"Not too light and bendy. not too heavy and stiff. these picks are just right. Dunlop also makes quality picks. and I have yet to break one of these. They last a long time. I am a guy so at first I wished they weren't purple. but since Dunlop only codes their sizes with certain colors I like them so much I don't really care what color they are anymore. I bought a pack of these picks for much less money at my local music store so I would recommend looking there first. Now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these. Now!"
5,"If you can't find a container and add your own sponge. then buy this.Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.I think this item should cost three bucks at most. and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.I use this one for my baritone uke. and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.If you make your own. just make sure to not let the sponge drip. ie. wring it out. and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood."
5,"Purchased this to replace the Dampit as a no drip alternative. With the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use. Distilled water will extend the life of the sponge. Overall simple and effective.However. I may have added too much humidity. Was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity. but I then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case.I do use a hydrometer but I don't think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar. but only the inside of the case.So I think the Planet Waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose. but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it."
5,"I have an electronic indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier.It is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer.The whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47%.This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier. Makes the whole house safer for the Martins.Now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity. but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system.A sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too. Just don't get water on the wood.And don't forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case. Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case.All the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms."
5,"I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy. except distilled water.  In all actuality. its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry. you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets 'hydrated?'. I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills. so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall. good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J"
5,"Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence. it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings. redesign the mount. say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen."
5,"I am in agreement with others that state this is a must-have. I battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard. This really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood. I've used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard. I rub the entire neck down before and after I play. It makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop. which I suspect is what they must've been using all these years and never told me. though I never did ask...foolish me. Since I've recently gotten into doing my own setups. where I've read many forums and posters have recommended this and I figured what the heck. it's less than $5."
5,"Especially for the price. this is a great buy.  The strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when I would slide up and down the fretboard. and I was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too.  The only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on. but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that aren't shining like they use to.  I just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure I wiped it in/off as thoroughly as possible. which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as I went from fret to fret.  Not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing.  The ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever!  Take 10-15 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor..."
5,"I have been using GHS Fast fret for over six years and it's amazing stuff. I apply just a tiny amount to the strings before I play and then wipe them down afterwards. I used to change strings every one to two months and now strings can last me a year. It's easy to control home much you put on and one can of this stuff lasts me a year or two. there isn't really any reason to just soak everything with it I don't think. I mainly use it to clean the strings. I'm really glad I found this stuff!"
5,"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name. but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product. but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret. my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me. my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too..."
5,"The tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked. especially when I've been playing a lot.  The problem. at least for me. is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides. bends. and pull-offs less fluid.  A few strokes of GHS makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience.  An alternative would be using Vaseline on my fingers. but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard.  Also. I sometimes use an Emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps. but I'd rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong.  GHS allows me to minimize that."
5,"These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company."
5,"I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before.  It just didn't seem to want to hang on. so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement.This is what I chose. and notably. I chose it for the color. just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar.So far. it's given me no problems. and it looks very nice and functions perfectly.  This is a great bargain. too. since it's certainly not an expensive accessory."
5,"I really didn't expect this guitar strap to be anything more than what it is. It's tight knit nylon with leather to attach to the strap posts. It's not a super fancy top of the line guitar strap. but it serves it's purpose well. feels sturdy enough and it's adjustable for a man of any size. I ordered it on the 20th and received it on the 23rd. no complaints here. If you are like me and do not feel that it is necessary to spend 20$ or 30$ on a guitar strap then this would suit you just fine. for 6$ you can't beat it. buy one or 2 nothing to lose here"
5,"Nothing special. Just like every other strap of its kind. I compared it to other poly straps I have and it's OK. No better and no worse. Price was good. It took a long time to come. Leather ends seem OK. I mention that because it appears to be the main complaint..I'm using it as a spare so it should be OK. I'm a little disappointed. I'm used to a higher quality from EB products. It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone. I don't perform a lot of antics on stage. it's just me and the axe. I don't expect any problems. Hope this helps. Small &#34;thumbs up&#34; to Amazon."
5,"So perhaps I don't know what shade burgandy really is. Or the picture is a bit misleading. It is as stated. although the picture shows a criss cross pattern this is just woven. As too 'DEE's reveiw... the buckle doesn't seem to bother me. I am not calling him or her out or anything. My best guess. it's playing style. I myself play bass. when I first started I played on the 3' inch straps and found they bothered me. went to the 2' straps proplem solved. I am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother. But for me and the way I play... No complaints."
5,"This is my second Ernie Ball strap i have gotten. and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them. These straps have leather ends that hold the guitar securely. the strap itself is a step down from a seatbelt (If a seatbelt will keep me in place at high speeds this strap will keep your guitar in place at low speeds). and the length would be sufficient even if you are 7 ft. tall. Coming in several different colors to match any color guitar this is the only strap i will buy in the future."
5,"I like the durability of it. and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be. but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
5,"Holy guacamole. you guys- this amp...I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND.Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase. then decided to try once more.Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking.I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it. I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone. Haven't cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but I'm sure it'll sound awesome too."
5,"Just got this stand today.First impressions are always important. and this stand gave me a good impression.It seems to be made solid enough. not like some cheap off brand crap.The base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over.The telescope mechanism is quite well made.Comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters.I got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall. It's quite the perfect height for when I'm seated on my stool.One thing I did not quite like about the construction is the crew on rod to the base place. It unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved. Maybe adding something to keep it screwed in?Would recommend to others.Probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs."
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
5,"I bought this recently and I love it. Why?  It has no &#34;smell&#34;. it leaves no residue on your hands. it's very &#34;light&#34; but yet it cleans. shines. and polishes your guitar beautifully.  It leaves a protective coating on the guitar which not only protects the finish. it also makes it ultra-shiny glossy and brings out the rich deep colors. This is fantastic stuff. If you own a guitar this is the best product out there. But what else can you expect from a US company like Gibson. I was very suprised that it was this effective. This little bottle goes a long way. I have already polished all of my guitars and my friend's guitars and I still have more than 1/2 a bottle left. If you need to polish your guitar look no further. This is your best choice."
5,"I sent it back. probably due to my ignorance.  Has multiple patterns to collect sound.  Was a clear mike but I didn't detect any body to the sound.  Maybe a preamp would have helped.  I checked out many mikes and ended up with a Rode NT-1A which is probably similar in character.  My goal was to record my voice without color and this came close.  I wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars?  Suspicious ratings to me.  Now that I have more experience I would be curious to check it out.  But since I found a good solution I don't think it's worth the effort."
5,"Ok here's the deal...I'm just a small home studio type of guy. and honestly I wasn't expecting much when I shelled out the $120 for this mic.  I have just always seen it around and I thought it would be a solid choice for my first multi-pattern mic!  The first time I recorded with it. I had it on omni mode and played some acoustic....it sounded amazing!  I can't believe this mic is that good.  Crisp. clean sound (who cares if it's made in China like that one guy says?). and very flexible usage.  I've since used it on toms. acoustic. a room mic for amps. and even some background vocals. and it has shined every time!So if you're like me and looking for a low-price LDC with multiple patterns. GET THIS.  You won't be disappointed at all!  :)"
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
5,"Years ago I used the Clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. I couldn't tell from the picture. that these were full size. and I didn't check the size in the description.  I still had a few of the small ones. so I used them as templates. to cut these down. I would have rated them higher. if I could have used them as is. It's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks. but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm (Orange) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks. 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper."
5,"Seriously. this is a great pedal. I can't improve upon what others have said. but I will mention a few points.1. I use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone. or to add more crunch to my Fender Frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop. It's run before time based effects (delay. phaser. etc) for me.2. I sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster. while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies.3. If it gets noisy or 'self oscillates' after a while. change the battery to a fresh one. Better yet. use an AC adapter.I found out about the last issue after reading a few Harmony Central reviews. Otherwise. it's been on my setup for about seven years. I take care of my stuff."
5,"Well. just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours...I still think it takes a bit of brightness on bypass but when it's on it's great! I've been thinking on using it mainly as a boost for leads but it sounds so much better with it i can't seem to turn it off!it's light. small and it looks well built but only time will tell how resistent it is but hey for 30 bucks it's a great deal!This is a good EQ for an excelent price. not an excelent EQ so i give it a 4 out of 5 and look forward to testing some others danelectro pedals."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
5,"I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting it's EQ. Most distortion pedals I plugged into it ended up sounding way to &#34;bassy&#34;. and so I bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little. I really didn't expect much since this pedal was so cheap; and for a brand new one at that; I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids. If you're looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar. I'd recommend this."
5,"These Danelectro pedals are great quality for the money. I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more 'brilliance' to the tone. The case is plastic. not very attractive. and perhaps not very sturdy. Also the button to push down for the effect leaves a bit to be desired -- it doesn't feel very solid. But I intend to use this more for recording than live use. so I'm not worried about that. Anyway. there aren't many EQ's on the market. and for the price. it can't be beat. I would recommend it."
5,"What can I say. they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still. after all of these years and innovations in strings. Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!"
5,"I originally purchased these strings because of the 11-52 gauges. I wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around 12-54. Upon installing these strings. I can't really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge. but maybe it's too small to notice with the naked eye. I'm not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old DAddario strings that they replaced. They might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new. The guitar that I'm using them on. is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway. so everything sounds nice and smooth. Overall. I'm satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings. but I don't think I'm ready to give up DAddarios yet."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
5,"Heard good things about the Ernie Ball Slinky string set and decided to give it try on our son's Taylor GS Mini.  Replaced the worn out strings out of that guitar and he is back in business.  Honestly though. it is hard to really compare strings. these seem fine and currently I see no reason to try another brand.  In conclusion. I see no reason not to buy and install these again.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
5,"These guitar strings are nothing special. and based on the amazingly low price nobody should expect them to be. They work well. look good. and are fairly durable at a very low price. I was remodeling an old Behringer and all I wanted was a fresh. shiny set of new strings. For playing. they sound pretty good. Best part. in my opinion. is that they're made in America. as well as the majority of Fender products. If you want to spend the extra money. I'd stil recommend Ernie Ball over these. or perhaps simply a higher quality pair of these Fender strings. You get what you pay for. As far as shipping. Musician's Friend did a great job getting the order out quickly. I'll be ordering from Musician's Friend again."
5,"I bought a guitar and for a while used the strings that were provided with it.  After a month of using those strings I decided to replace them since I was having trouble keeping the low E string in tune.  I put these strings on and compared to the &#34;default&#34; strings. it was almost silky and softer by comparison.I'm guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel. The sound was much nicer to my ears as well.  They were relatively inexpensive and made a great choice for replacing the strings on a new guitar."
5,"These are the Gold standard for all Strat type electrics. Fender or not.  I put these 150's on all of my Strats regardless of the brand.  They are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great.  I tend to play my Strats a bit rougher than my Gibson's or acoustics so these are well tested in my house.  I get a bit carried away with amp volume and tend to bend the strings a bit.  I will continue using these on all of my Strats until I find something better which I haven't yet.  I do use other strings on other types of guitars and you can see my reviews on those as well.These are bullet proof.  They take a pounding and last as long as you could expect!!!"
5,"I use Fender strings and I have used many other brands as well.  I like Nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound.  I change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit I can go 2 to 3 weeks for hard playing.I started using Fender strings with the Stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat.  They sounded great.  I use these for my telecaster in 10 -46 (factory spec) and they are real nice too.I do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets.  I have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period.  Stick to nickel and you will be glad you did!"
5,"I've used quite a few strings out there and imo these are the best for feel. sound and overall quality. If you play Fender instruments you can't go wrong using their strings. Of course strings are a subjective thing so to each his own but I will say I used 2 different strings most of my life but was in a guitar store one day and picked up a Tele and was immediately impressed with the strings. I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were D'Addario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender. So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well. Been buying them ever since and love them."
5,"I've always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this medium/light set and I was not disappointed. There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging. They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings. I've always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to. Would recommend to any level of guitar player!"
5,"I've used GHS medium bronze wound strings on my Martin D-18 for several years. I thought I'd give these Ernie Ball strings a shot after reading reviews. They are lighter than I expected. They are closer to 'light' than medium. I'm not that impressed. They sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets. I think the next set I buy will be medium and probably GHS. You never know until you try.Update: I've gotten used to the 'sound' of these strings and I DO like that they are easier on the old fingers when playing. Pure Bluegrass players like to torture their fingers with heavier strings to get that mellow BG sound. though. ;) At my age I need all the help I can get. so I'll have to admit that I like do like these strings."
5,"I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. The sound I get from the AD&G strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. The strings seem to hold up well. I cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. These strings sound great. I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing."
5,"I have owned two of these stands. The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared. The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place. Not the greatest stands by any means. but for what they're worth. I didn't mind spending another $10 to get one. Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable. But price. ability to collapse. and it's light weight made it the one I bought... again."
5,"I love these little guitar stands. They are small enough to go anywhere with you. and they are cheap enough that you can keep a couple of them around. Which is good if you are as clumsy as I am.The last two of these that I have owned met untimely deaths. The first was on stage and since it is so small I tripped over it on the back of the stage. The second one I tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage. I know. I know... but they really are cool little stands. and I just bought another one lol. I am a glutton for punishment!"
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
5,"This stand seems to be made especially with the Fender Stratocaster in mind and might also be a perfect fit for other Fender guitars.  On my Les Paul the cable plug on the guitar is exactly where the bottom holder bar is.  If I adjust the guitar so the plug is not on the bar. the guitar sits at an angle where the guitar might tip over on it's side.Needless to say I will use this stand for my Stratocaster but I am purchasing a different model for the Les Paul."
5,"I knoew I did not want any holder that took up too much room in my music room. not did I want something that would tip over if I blew air on it. My instructor of the guitar suggested I really read the information about all of the holders and then make my choice of the one that seemed to be light-weight yet sturdy to not fall over. looked professional. and could be the possibility of THE one I would recommend and purchase again. I really like the stability of the one I bought."
5,"I take workshop style guitar courses at a local Vo-Tech in a room that could not be any less suited to the purpose. People set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall. Bad scene (sounds like an old 'El Kabong' cartoon). and not what I want to have happen to my new Seagull Artist series guitar. This little Fender stand easily folds up into a package small enough to fit in the storage pocket of my deluxe TRIC case so I can take it with me to class.It's not the sturdiest. most secure or most stable design out there. but given it's extreme portability and the use I'll put it to. it's going to work great."
5,"I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didn't have to. The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me! So it's like that guy who asks for a lighter...uses it...and puts it in his pocket every single time. these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter.I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers.It's a decent tool at a good price so buy one...Then see how long you can own it!"
5,"I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams. but alas. I was wrong. The winding apparatus works beautifully. but the cutter doesn't allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference. so I'm back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. All in all. a good product to have if you don't have pliers on hand or don't mind getting a closer snip.I cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn't have pegs - luckily. the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge. which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. Each to their own. I suppose."
5,"The winder works well for me. and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I don't have to search out a pair of snips). but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward.  Also. the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy. and doesn't work well for reluctant pins.  I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more. but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter. so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon."
5,"I was a bit concerned about this tool after reading some reviews that owners had damaged expensive guitars. but thought I would just be careful with it.  But I have no concerns after using it on two string changes.  In fact. I cannot see how one could nick the guitar while winding. since the tool does not even cover the entire tuning key so it never gets close the guitar head.  The string cutter works great. one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly.  The pry tool for acoustic guitar pegs works. and though it is a tighter fit than I expected. it does work and means I don't need to find a pliers.  Overall. I am very pleased and saved time on string changes."
5,"String changes usually take me 10 to 12 minutes each but I restrung all 3 of my guitars in less than 13 minutes (one is a floating tremolo). The spanner is smooth. the cutter is strangely very clean cutting (usually use electrician wire dykes) and the pin puller is nothing fancy. but does the trick quickly. Awesome little tool and very impressed with it. A++++ on every function. would consider maybe putting a few small rubber inserts on the handle for those sweaty hands. but other than that. it's perfectly perfect. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
5,"After getting tired of spending a half hour each time changing strings. I finally caved and bought this nifty little gadget. I just wanted a string winder at first but thought this one was kinda cool and reasonably priced too. I didn't expect the string cutter to be as well as it is. I thought my wire cutters would be much better but the cutter on this baby is just as great! It also has a pin puller which I haven't tried yet but I'm sure it's great as well. This would be perfect for the gigging or traveling musician. or if you just want a great all in one tool. But this thing!"
5,"Primarily purchased to have a string cutter in the guitar case rather than going to get one from my tool box.Found the pin puller did not really work for me. so put my old string winder from 20 yrs. ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine. Seemed no matter how I tried. I was almost scratching the saddle tried to get that groove under the head of the pins and could never get it to work on a six string steel acoustic guitar.It seems that &#34;C&#34; shaped opening in the end is for stretching strings. and I find that is better done by hand. So really I just use this for the wire cutter feature.  And the string winder itself also works well."
5,"For about $8 you get a string winder. string cutter and an acoustic peg remover all-in-one.What more can you ask for?Mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use.I have nice wire cutters. etc (I'm an EE) but it is much easier to grab one tool instead of two or three.As for quality. it has an unconditional guarantee. see above.Planet Waves -aka D'Addario- is a well-known name in guitar accessories.To the reviewers complaining about the tool breaking. try using your warranty instead of whining.No manufacturer has a perfect run forever. but at least in this case you have not wasted your money.For the record. I do not work for D'Addario / Planet Waves - but I would not dismiss a job off-hand if they offered it  ;-)"
5,"Finally. a winder that has features and durability designed into it.  The pocket of the winder head appears to be large enough to handle any tuning peg head size and the molded plastic body appears to be thick enough to stand up to a lot of use.  The pivot point doesn't bind when using the winder as has a couple other cheaper models I've purchased (and thrown away) over the years.  The string cutter is a great feature and appreciated. works well regardless of string composition type....stainless. chromes. core-types. etc.  The price seems fair enough.  I've seen a couple of battery powered models for not much more money. but if you're in that big a hurry to change strings you're living life too fast...... get a 'roadie' to do it for you.... why have to remember to carry spare batteries."
5,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking. bending. becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy. you'll love it. and if not. you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
5,"I own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough. I don't really enjoy changing strings but it needs done. this tool makes it such a breeze I don't know how I ever went without it. It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings. I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever. I am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from Planet Waves."
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
5,"When i bought this. i didn't think it was going to be as good as it is. It seemed a little plastic-ie from the photos. so i didn't think it was going to hold up very well. It actually really surpassed my expectations however. The winder itself works quite well. and has slots for multiple-sized tuners. It was a little wobbley on my guitar. but still worked well. The wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem. For 7 dollars. it's a really good deal!"
5,"I have purchased and used many various types of Guitar String Winders and I must admit that the Planet Waves Pro Winder is the very best I have used to date.  It is an all in one and there is no need to carry extra equipment to cut the strings....pull pegs..etc.  It is sturdy and should last  many moons and cut many strings before needing replacement.  Because of the affordable price on Amazon I will be buying some for my friends as Christmas Stocking Stuffers.  The Planet Waves Pro Winder is well worth the cost and I recommend it to anyone.  Also. with the string winder I also purchased accoustic guitar strings and requested regular shipping (free shipping) which promised that the items would be shipped within 5 to 7 days. The items were ordered on the Thursday and received on the Saturday....THREE SHORT DAYS...Treat yourself!  Thank you Amazon!"
5,"I never had one of these until I had to twist each tuner around 60 times to change a string.  But that's not a problem any more.I used to go through my hardware drawer at home to find wire cutters to trim my string ends.  But that's not a problem any more.And I used to hurt my teeth sometimes pulling tough bridge pins on my acoustic.  But that's not a problem any more either.All solved by one simple tool which is inexpensive and fits easily in my case.  So I'm a fan.  You'll be too."
5,"After you have used this tool for the first time. you say to yourself....&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there. winding forever by hand. With this winder. you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts. that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;. I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
5,"i use to use my hands to turn the tuning pegs and let me tell you that takes forever to take off strings and put them on. also my wire cutter is getting messed up from cutting strings and now that i have this i can change strings faster and i dont have to look for a wire cutter all the time.its small and can fit in the pouch of a guitar case also for people who are new to guitar you dont use this to tune its to put strings on and be careful not to over tune because you will break strings.hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning. this is just to get the tuning in the ball park and then using your hands."
5,"I love this system.  Every time I change strings now. I go through every step of this system. and what a difference it has made.  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great.  I never realized how dry the wood was.  The string cleaner is nice too.  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this.  The quantities of product in this kit are good. and the instructions are clear.  The two polishing cloths are adequate size. and washable."
5,"the best thing I've purchase for my guitars this year . I'm not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning . the 01 and 02 are the best. restore the live of my fretboard. the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine . the only one that I've just use once is the string conditioner and cannot say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i don't play with it after the cleaning .but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioner.you can buy this with your eyes close. you wont regret the purchase."
5,"While I'm spectacle on what I want to &#34;clean my baby with (Fender P Bass) and after reading many feed backs on Amazon. I decided to try this kit. My Bass is not that old. but really needed to be cleaned and polished. This kit really make it so clean. it looks better than when I purchased it new. No greasy residue either. My fret board looks so good to. Just don't use it on maple wood (the lighter color). at least that is what the directions states because it my yellow this lighter color. I can tell you that the rose wood is nice and deep colored red. The other cleaners and polishes are great too. I will definitely purchase this kit again when I run out of the supplies."
5,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect but have a few old guitars with pretty weathered looking fingerboards.  I figured I'd give this a try.  I am so glad I did.  I could not believe how much residue was on the rag after I cleaned the fret board. yuk.  Then I used the 02 treatment product to treat it and it really brought out the natural color.  I'd like to say it looks like new. but the guitar is a 1967 so that would be a stretch.But it looks a heck of a lot better. almost new.  I used it on one of my less valuable acoustics. but it's still a '67 USA made Fender.  I have such faith in this that I'm going to do my '77 Gibson acoustic next.Then I have a couple of electrics I will do when I change strings on them.  This stuff is great."
5,"Nice little kit. it has 800 grit sandpaper in it. I hadn't noticed that in the listing. maybe I overlooked it. I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade. The 600 made it glassy smooth again (wet sanding) - I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me.I had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board. Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible. I was miserable. my guitar sounded like s***.After 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bob's your uncle. good as new. I'm going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitars.Nice little kit. I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days. Works a charm on acoustic guitars. haven't tried it on the electric guitars yet."
5,"I bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape.  I guess this kit works okay. but it's hard to use.  It will probably last my entire lifetime.  I think a smaller kit would have been better.  You really need to remove the strings when you use it. so you have to take off all the strings.  I usually only replace one string at a time when I am changing strings. so I had to change my habits.  If you have a guitar without a truss rod. that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you're done changing the strings. since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time. and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned.  I'm no expert. but I have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent.  However. since I love my guitar. I use it anyway."
5,"I cleaned and oiled the fretboard on my straocaster the day after I received the product. The cleaning product worked very nicely but the oil was hard to get out through the applicator. The fretboard turned out nicely though so I decided to give it a 4 instead of a 3. I have to say though that I believe a big bottle of eye glass cleaner to clean the fretboard with and a good furniture polish would work just as well. Since you only use a small amount the kit will last a long time so it isn't a bad buy. Just remember it isn't recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it. If you want to use this type of product then I recommend this one."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
5,"I use earnie ball strings as my backup strings. They don't have as nice and clear a tone as my d'addario or curt mangan strings. nor do they have the life expectancy. however they are cheaper and really easy to bend. Since I can't afford to restring with the more pricey strings every single time. I go with these when I'm practicing. They do break alot when I play some crazy solos. which blows. and is the main reason why I'm not giving them 5s. (No it's not my technique. I've never broken a string on any other brand strings I've tried.) When I'm in the studio recording. I prefer. like I said before. D'addario or curt mangan strings. however to save money. I practice with these strings and I think it's not a bad method. as I go through strings like doritos (I eat doritos alot)."
5,"I read a review saying that there bridge was floating out & the strings were hard to tune aswell as their e string popping. I had the exact same experience but i bought two sets since i know uncoated strings dont last long. so i did get to play em but all my strings (except the A & E) popped on both sets within two weeks i knew it was due to my bridge being made to use a whammy bar (which it came with btw)& the tension it put on my tuning pegs what really got me upset about these strings was that they damaged my tuning pegs and now there harder to turn (have to use pliers sometimes) but the strings sound great & if i get a better guitar i might get these more often but for now im staying w/ medium gauge elixirs."
5,"These strings actually save you money because you don't have to change em much. I keep em on a year or so and I play alot. out door indoor. constant abuse. they never rust. When they break I change em.now..I'm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so I like not having to change em..they really hold up. There are better sounding strings yes. But if your plugin in anyway. you can tweak the tone.The tone isn't bad. just not as good as a martin uncoated string.but if you like longevity and less squeak. these are great."
5,"I ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends.  They didn't care at all for nanowebs which are widely available. but swore by the quality of the polywebs.  By some sort of mixup I got nanowebs by mistake.  I requested a return to get the proper item. and the seller offered to send me the polywebs and told me to keep the nanowebs for the trouble.  I haven't had a chance to test either set of strings out but I'm sure they'll be great.It's my understanding that the polywebs could practically be the last set of strings you ever buy (with some proper care).  I've been told that while nanowebs last longer than normal strings. they don't measure up to the polywebs."
5,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned. sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned. sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
5,"I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store.  Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string.  Have 2 problems with the strings.  First. the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up.  Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir).  I have changed strings many. many times. so I am convinced it was not my stringing. but a weakness in the E string itself.  Second. the high D (8th string) seems 'dead'; it does not 'ring' as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets I've used).  Considering these strings cost much more than others. I certainly am disappointed in them.  Hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good."
5,"I kinda strayed away from the Elixir brand for a little while just 'To See' if another brand would sound 'better' and in doing so. I wasted time and money.(but I did get some EXPERIENCE) I'm back with the Elixirs now and have no intentions to 'Experiment' any more.Simply put............Elixir makes the best Strings for an Acoustic Guitar that I've tried and I 'Will Stick with them' because they have Great Sound. last a long time. easy to clean and prevent rust and/or corrosion."
5,"Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings.....to the less and also most expensive strings.  I find the Elixir excellent. My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet. That may change along the way.However. I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine.  What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else's palate.  Therefore. strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear.My ears remain attentive to future string sounds.  I also love the d'Addario make.  Which I purchase through Amazon...always."
5,"After about a month and a half I have noticed some corrision on the A and D strings at the 4th fret.  That is a little disapointing because these are suppost to last 3 to 5 times longer than 'regular' strings.  I like the way they sound.  They are a little harder to play than the D' Addario strings that I am used to on my other guitar. and the Martins that I have used in the past.  If I still have to change them every 2 or 3 months they are not really worth the extra cost."
5,"I read several reviews before purchasing these strings. I've never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my Yamaha acoustic. it sounded great! They have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar. My Yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is. If you're wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings. definitely give these a try. The coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not. but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board."
5,"Time will tell if they last longer than strings 1/3rd the price. Visually. they don't appear any different than cheaper Bronze wound strings. I was expecting something different. but as far as sound goes. the strings tuned well and only required some stretching 3 times to get them to stay in tune. even after playing &#34;smear notes&#34; on several songs. My problem with cheaper strings (De'Angelo) was they would tarnish or rust quickly. the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar. The company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last 3 to 5 times longer. I'll know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not. Since these are literally triple the cost. I'll know if it was worth the extra expense. Hopefully these are made in the USA instead of China like most other things we buy in America. Good or bad. once I see the longevity of this set. I'll add to this review at that time."
5,"I've been playing guitar for about 15 years - and within the last year bought my first Taylor guitar (Taylor Guitars 414CE-LTD Grand Auditorium Acoustic Electric Guitar). It came with these Elixir strings on it from the factory. I am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce. What's even better is how long they last.I'm pretty hard on my strings. I useDunlop Standard Tortex Picks. 12 Pack. Purple. 1.14mmwhich are very stiff. and chew up strings very quickly. The nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several MONTHS instead of weeks. They're a little bit more expensive then other major string brands. But after about a year of listening to these (only gone through 3 sets so far). they're worth the extra few bucks."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
5,"I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them."
5,"I tend to sweat when I play. so coated strings are a necessity for me.  These are as good as any coated string on the market. I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings.  Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string. These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well.  Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play!  Oh. and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them.  The guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it."
5,"Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy. sealed looking fretboard. that doesn't have that problem. but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's. but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands."
5,"I get everything on Amazon now.  Need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping.  Elixir is what Tom Anderson uses and I trust his judgment.  He makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course. Have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings. I do Not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time.  Stretch them bend them and they don't break.  If your bending a couple steps or more then I would love to know what string holds up consistently.  Thanks much."
5,"Yes. these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now I've put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and D'Addario on my acoustics. but no more. I'm only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do. however. seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it."
5,"While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled. the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very. very smooth to play and the sound is amazing. I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric. and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat. mellow. sweet sound."
5,"Without changing my pickups or polishing my frets. I thought I'd try to get a little more sustain switching up strings. At first I thought I had got a bum buy because the I had to bring the action up a bit to account for the over brightness of the strings. Had my tone all off and I was ready to dig my other set back out of the trash..... played on it for a half hour (went through the exact same thing with the Polywebs I put on the RG655) then retuned. sounded pretty good. Played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now. Dropped the action back down and it's smooth as silk in an hour's time. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
5,"I liked my Elixir strings on my acoustic. so I knew that the ones for electric would be worth the extra money (as compared to non-coated brands).  They seem to create less noise from unintentional slide friction--it's sort of like the difference between flatwound and regular strings--these feel like super-flatwound strings. meaning they feel smooth.  I have some nice callusses built up. but I imagine that I'd like these strings even more if I was just starting out (or restarting) because I imagine they tear up your fingertips much less than non-coated strings."
5,"Elixir strings are very nice.  so slick and last forever compared to standard strings..But i will admit D addario strings are just as good but have to be replaced more often. So if you have the money and want to try these technology advanced strings i dont think you will be disappointed. Some people say they are too slick.. and i can see that when you put new strings on you expect them to feel a certain way..  But you will get over that once you see how long they last."
5,"These are my favorite brand of strings.When i was a beginner a few years back these were the 1st strings i bought on my electric (since i used them on my acoustic) And i have to say. elixir is my favorite brand of strings. They last long. are easy to tune. & have a nice bright sound & if you take proper care of them (wipe them down when your done playing. keep the guitar in your gig bag when your not using it. ETC.) that bright sound can last about 6 MONTHS OR MORE!! i usually just buy about two sets a year & im a HEAVY player i play about 2-7 hours EVERYDAY. I love the coating aswell but the medium gauge & up usually don't have that other coating you can get on the light gauge strings. but overall these strings are awesome & are a must buy for every guitarist!"
5,"These strings sound great. play great. and the coating really does keep down the squeaking. Some purists don't like the coating movement when it comes to strings. and it does take a micron off the treble. but they last a loooong time. I usually only have to change my strings once a month. I use them on my Washburn acoustic guitar. and play rock. folk. and country strumming. They rock. and I feel they are the best strings around today. period.  These strings are very small. and are great for playing for long periods of time. without brutalizing the fingertips. Some people say the real light strings are not good for recording. and you probably have less of a bass boom. but I like 'em."
5,"I have been using these strings for 7 years.  At first I used the Elixir Polywebs. but those things broke all the time.  I switched to these and haven't broke a string since.  If you play a Gibson or Martin I would buy a heavier string. but these match well with my 414ce Taylor.  Because of the price I don't use these on my cheap Fender Acoustic. for that I suggest Earthwoods.  I even use the Electric version of these strings on my American Srat. very pleased there as well."
5,"I own aTaylor Guitars 355-CE Jumbo 12 String Acoustic Electric Guitarand it came with these strings on it. 12 string guitars are generally hard to play for long periods of time. so they might not get as much use as a regular 6 string. The tone from these strings is just as bright and clear 8 months later. and they still hold their tuning like they after the first 2 days. Elixir strings are in general more expensive than other major brands - but the extra few bucks are worth it because the sounds stays so clear and consistent after extensive use. They are great strings on any guitar."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I was a little reluctant to try the EVO XM as I have a Vendetta and the tuners are junk.  Fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issue.It's a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup.  Action is incredible.  Almost too low for those that do a lot of stretching but great for those that are into fast riffs.  The difference in tone between the neck and bridge pickups is great and the pickups are very responsive.Hardware is slightly better than expected for this price point."
5,"This is my second 4 way switch and it won't be the last. The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series. which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1.2.or 3. I am very pleased with the &#34;new sound&#34; of my tele. The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun. (don't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder)."
5,"I got these for a parts-tele I built and I'm really happy with them.  Like all vintage tuners you may need conversion bushings to make them fit modern peg holes which are usually larger.  But they look great. work great. stay in tune and are completely vintage spec.  I have a '57 reissue strat and I can't tell the difference.  One thing I've always loved about vintage tuners is that you tuck the strings in the center of the shaft so it keeps the headstock looking neat."
5,"These Fender string guides are replacing the old style string guide(tree). Installed on a Tele I built. Much less surface of the string touching. Very smooth action when using the vibrato. Took no more than 10 minutes to install.. Reasonably priced. super upgrade. I recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar. These look like rollers. but are not rollers. They do work well. and I will purchase more for other Tele's and StratsPros: Well made  Cons; None I can think ofSleek. well designedQuick installImproved soundInexpensive upgrade"
5,"Not a drop in replacment for many Fenders. I installed these on a Fender Marauder and needed to drill holes in the head stock. You can't see it really well in the picture but there is a metal plug on the bottom next to the screw hole that needs a hole to fit into.I sweat some bullets and used the smallest drill bit I own. and stuck a piece of tape 1mm from the tip so I wouldn't drill too deep. It is important to make the hole STRAIGHT in line from the screw hole so they don't go on crooked. I also had to drill the screw holes about 2mm deeper because the screws that come with this go deeper into the headstock.Now that they're installed I can attest that the guitar holds it's tune better and it's easier to tune. Before it would not respond for many pegs until twisted too far then it would suddenly break lose and be too sharp/flat. That happens far less now."
5,"People complain that these aren't really rolling string trees. despite the fact that the description *never* says or even implies they are. in fact. 'rolling' string trees.  Honestly. they don't need to be. at least for most guitars.  These small. round guides are superior to the flat. wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings.  Less contact means less friction. less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don't have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move.I put them on a cheap Telecaster copy I have and noticed the results immediately. and I did not replace either the tuners or the nut. those are still the cheap stock parts.If you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot. rollers might be a little better. but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade (anyone can change them. all you need is a screwdriver). it was a no brainer for my Telecaster."
5,"A great. clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps. The guides on these are not rollers. but are the next best thing visually and performance wise in my opinon.  The only guides that I like better are the round 50's guides for Tele's. but then I like those asthetically only on Tele's.  An inexpensive mode that looks and works great.  To the inexperienced eye this simple. clean looking mod can make a Mexican or Chinese instrument look more like the made in America models."
5,"I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar. so after some research online and talking to friends. I bought this capo.It goes on easily.comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar. Downside. seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings. I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekend.Let me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know. Thanks!"
5,"In 40+ years of using many Jim Dunlop products Made in America or to his standards of quality. I've never broken or worn out the capo. I use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars. The spring tension remains strong after several years. which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing. The only problem I have with them. they seem to disappear when I'm not looking. I have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use. Other than smudges from getting the capo dirty. it cleans easily."
5,"I haven't used it a lot yet. but I really like it so far.. Much easier to put on than the 30 year old capo I was using. and it works for my guitars and my banjo. without putting them out of tune. It seems to be solidly made as well. and not too much pressure as others said.. My old capo put a lot more pressure than this does :P. and was much heavier. I'd assume it was made out of Cast-Iron or something instead of Aluminum."
5,"How you feel about a capo has almost as much to do with the guitar you're using it on... What works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another... I can say with confidence that this capo works flawlessly on an American Standard Strat... Fits great. easy on/off. easy adjustments. The padding on the capo is such that you would really have to go out of your way to mar the finish on your neck with it... All relevant areas of the capo are well padded. It seems very well constructed. after two weeks of heavy use. I don't see why it wouldn't last for years."
5,"I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.  They definitely look great. but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so.  That's my experience at least.  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people. but they are wonderful.  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out.  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one.  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!"
5,"Although it is touted for acoustic guitars. it works well with my Ibanez Electric as well as my dreadnaught and acoustic/electric. The spring is tough and it holds securely. On and off is a quick process if you have the hand/finger strength to operate it. I rate it 4 stars only because I just received it and haven't had a chance to use it much. But. I like it so far. It was delivered quickly. It does the job. I'll update after I've had it for awhile."
5,"This is actually the first capo I have ever owned. as I am pretty new to playing the guitar. That being said. I paid close to $14 with free shipping for this capo. and I feel it is a good value. It feels well constructed. like it won't break if I drop it. The capo fits nice and tight on all six strings. Ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitar's neck. The spring mechanism is plenty tight. but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed. even while playing. The capo is sleek looking. and a bit smaller than I was expecting at 3&#34; x 3&#34;. but I have no frame of reference for comparison.Item was shipped on time. and packaged in the original Dunlop packaging. Part number: 83CB. Made in USA! No counterfeit here. If you have any questions. feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can. Thanks for reading.SPO"
5,"...but for a small woman with small hands. it's difficult to operate.  It also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings. which can't be good for them.  I ordered a Schubb brand capo that's much easier to operate and doesn't smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable.  The only drawback to the Schubb is you can't clip it to the headstock. a convenience that's important to a lot of professional musicians.  I'm keeping both. if I need the convenience of this clip on style I'll use it.  When playing at home I'll use the more gentle Schubb."
5,"I have used Fender Medium picks since the late 60's.  Yes. they are made in China now (!!) but they are still the same pick as far as I can tell.  The picks arrived fully sealed in an outer envelope and contained within a nice little mini zip-lock baggie.  All 12 were in there. all of them Fender Mediums.  (purchased from B&G; Music Associates)  Shipped from Illinois to California in 3 days with normal shipping.The picks are great and I couldn't be happier with the order. Whatever issues occurred with missing picks and poor shipping no longer exist from where I stand.  Recommended if you want/need a nice little bag of Fender Mediums."
5,"Even though the title says 'Acoustic Guitar Case'. it's obvious that this is a case for A-style mandolins. I chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo. and the reviews were good. Sure enough. the lining is soft and well-padded. The hardware works as it should. and the build quality is almost perfect. However. when closing the case. a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly. Just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to snap in place. then everything is as it should be. The case fits my A-type mandolin perfectly. and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around. The slight mis-fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case. It serves its purpose well. at a reasonable price."
5,"When I bought my first guitar about 6 months ago I just chose a pack of picks on Amazon's list of 'other buyers also bought this' and those were these Fender 351 picks.At the time I figured all picks were created equal.Since then I've tried various sizes and brands - Dunlop. Planet Waves. etc.But I keep coming back to this Fender 351 Medium pick for both my electric and acoustic guitar.The sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too trebly.The Planet Waves picks all seem to be a little muddy-sounding.I've found a winner with these Fender picks and will definitely be ordering more."
5,"I bought these picks because I liked the color of the picks.These picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are. I play guitar everyday for around 3-5 hours a day and I have yet to break one of these picks. Very nice quality and very cool color to them. They are also priced very good.Much cheaper buying them here at amazon instead of a quarter a piece at the guitar store. Recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar. Additionally. they are very fast at shipping them to your door. Three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step."
5,"These picks far exceed my expectations. I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest. nicest looking picks I own.  They look great. feel great and play great.  Call me a snob. but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself. buy these.I love the color and texture too. they don't slip or move around as you play."
5,"I used to play with celluloid picks back in the 70's before they came out with Delrin. I like the sound and feel of these picks. They add a nice round sound that works well with jazz. and funk. They are a little expensive. but I think they are worth it if you need the sound and feel of the real thing.I bought the abalone ones because they look cool...***UPDATE***I am still using these picks but they tend to break along the colored lines. and usually during a performance. I have since gone back to Delrin and Nylon."
5,"I read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box & decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks & really wanted heavy picks & the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy & has the fender logo on it. but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick. sweep pick. tremelo pick. tap with the pick better. Also my pitch harmonics (better known as squealies) come out clearer to me. Overall the product is not an disappointment & im only using these pick (just in different colors) from now on ^.^"
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
5,"Simple. compact. well constructed. easy to use. and sounds good; all things you would look for in a capo.This is the original Shubb capo. designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings. The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make. each with their own specialized use. The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models. This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 (Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar. Heritage Cherry Sunburst). aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar. Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge. andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar. Vintage Sunburstelectrics. The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic.Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension. It's key to not get too much tension.We've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo. Mostly it goes in a pocket. Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck. it doesn't clamp tight on the headstock. Not a huge deal. but a consideration."
5,"Researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the Shubb.  This is a capo that while is not easily adjustable to slide up and down like other spring types. it's a great capo and very durable in construction and material.  Like a good guitar that is well cared for. this is something that's great to hand down to the next generation.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
5,"I love this guitar strap button. It's a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in. I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink. It works well for it's stated purpose and appears to be of high quality. The leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole. Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close."
5,"I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
5,"I compared this cable to the monster studio pro 1000 cable i also own. I prefer this more as i play live and it does a good job in handling noise snd also has a no questions asked lifetime warranty. Just take your broken cable to your local guitar center and they will replace it. I got 4 replacememts over 3 years. Worth the higher price because of the warranty. The 100 dollar studio pro doesnt do well live compared to this rock cable as the studio pro sucks up tone snd only sounds good for recording. note. this cable has high mid range so if thats what you like go for it"
5,"These cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut. I have several other 'good' cables but when compared to this they cut highs and even the level. I have grown as a musician to the point that I Know it's worth it to pay a little more for these quality cables. Yes you can get many cables way cheaper (and I'm all for getting things at a good price - publishers clearing house has Not visited me yet!) but this is a case of you get what you pay for!"
5,"My review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones. I bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars. The cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage.One complaint I have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my Spector bass securely. but works with the others flawlessly. I use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues.I also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables and Mogami and think that this one is worth it's price. To me. the warranty is worth it because of the price. I reead all over the web about the opinions of monster's patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality. but there are more expensive cables out there made by Mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion."
5,"This shelf is so convenient and so often used that you would think that it should come on every music stand. It just slips on to the lower shelf and creates a smaller shelf for pencils. pens. clip on tuners. capos. etc. It pays dividens in not cluttering up your book shelf so that items go spilling to the floor every time you adjust a book or turn a page. I love how a pen. capo. or tuner clipped to the top lip of the shelf serve to keep pages firmly in place until your book is &#34;trained&#34; to stay in place. A must have. five star item."
5,"quiet. almost hum free - clear respose - no volume control doesn't befront me because i use it to record & to play thru a PA where either I or someone else keeps the volume under control. It tends to be bass heavy. but a slight eq revisit more than compensates for that. I had used one in the past. this is a more solid unit & fits movement free in the soundhole of my guitar & also in two others i use here and there. great job. great value. got herre quick in a nice little carry bag & I will update if problems come later - don't see why or how tho"
5,"This is an excellent-sounding pickup.  I've had it for about six years.  Good sound throughout the spectrum - full lows and bright highs. without too much emphasis on either.  At the price it sells for. I consider it a bargain.The drawbacks:1) You need to be pay attention when installing and removing - you can damage the sound hole on your guitar if you're not careful.2) No volume control.If you're looking to occasionally amplify an acoustic guitar. this is a great. cost-effective way to go."
5,"I've used this on a variety of 6 strings and a few 12 strings and it really does give a good sound for the price. And if you've got a variety of acoustics and don't want to get pickups installed in ALL if them this is a great solution. It tends to work slightly better for finger picking than strumming because occasionally your hand will hit the chord coming out if you're not careful.Remember that it must be used with a preamp and hopefully something (most likely a tuner) with stomp on/off bypass so that you can turn it off more easily."
5,"I've used D'Addario strings for many. many years without problems - both acoustic & electric.  I've tried these coated strings in the past. and I actually prefer them to Elixir because they feel more like regular strings - the wrap is coated. rather than a sheathe being placed over the entire string. like on Elixirs.Do they last longer?  Probably.  Even when I'm in situations where I'm gigging regularly I rarely change strings more than every few months. just because I don't see the need.  I think the main benefit to coated strings is if you have guitars that you can't play regularly the strings won't corrode.  But these sound great and feel fine. and the're the least expensive coated strings I've found.  I've always found D'Addario quality to be great."
5,"But unless you are new to guitar. you know that. These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. Really. I can't tell that they do. Or that they don't. They sound great. and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Not sure if I would pay more for these in future. I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way.  Change the strings every couple of months. Just me at home so no big deal. if I were performing I would go through them faster.I'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings. 'Nuff said."
5,"These are great strings. They are the right length and go on easy enough. They are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren't color blind. They go on. sound bright. and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings. Had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever. you only have to change them every 3 months or so. I had to reply that forever just doesn't last as long as it used to. Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 1/3 less. that is a good deal even if they don't last forever. That means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book. Worth the extra pesos."
5,"I recently sent two of my Ovations back to the factory in Connecticut for re-work (I just plain wore them out). and they came back to me with these strings on them.  As soon as I took them out of their case and strummed them. I immediately called the factory and said 'thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars. and by the way. these are the best sounding strings I've ever played. what exactly are they?'  I might experiment with the EXP15s. but by and large. these EXPs are my new strings."
5,"Not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze? Not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze. The EXPs are nice strings. They have a nice feel to them along with less string noise. And they last. My two acoustic  guitars. a Takamine Mini jumbo and a Gretsch jumbo. both made from mahogany are both nice sounding guitars. I figured i would try these 80/20 strings after using phospher bronze. Only real problem i noticed is the 80/20s seem brighter and they ring longer. I prefer the warmer tone. And since my guitars have alot of 'boom' already. i dont need the extra ring to complicate the sound with overtones when strumming fast. I imagine these strings may work in some instances. but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars."
5,"While I love and trust D'Addario strings. i am subtracting one star because. I really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets.  For my acoustics. I do not always change out all the strings at once.  I think the bass strings get changed more when they start falling off on sound.Anyway. these are classic strings that I grew up with. but as I get more involved with playing. having the flexibility of individual envelopes for each string becomes more an d more appreciated.  Especially if you like to save your single strings for use."
5,"I had for years been using Elixir Strings on myWashburn D10simply because I was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch. I'm glad I tried out these D'Addario strings. These strings are an excellent complement to my Washburn. which has mellowed out over the years. They are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the Elixir strings. I can't speak to the manufacturers claim of '4 times more life.' but as of now. I'd have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money. Highly recommended."
5,"I like them. but these strings are probably not for everyone. The EXP16s do provide a crisp. bright sound almost leaning towards metallic. This tone is actually refreshing on my old shallow-bodied Ovation. However. I have to imagine that on a dreadnought or jumbo this sound might be quite different.While I was not expecting it. my favorite aspect of the EXP16s is the playability. The play is a little more elastic than I thought it would be. and they are amazingly easy on the fingers.The only downside that I experienced with the EXP16s is the fact that. while giving once on the guitar. they are a little brittle off the guitar (I almost snapped my E getting it set up). Other than that. the strings are just a little squeaky. I personally like a little squeak. but at the current price point. I don't think that it would be a deal breaker even for those who don't."
5,"I've long been partial to D'Addario strings--I don't have a guitar without them. These phosphor bronze models have found a home on my Epiphone flat-top.  As the package says. they're warm and bright--leaning just a little toward the brassy side.  They project without sounding harsh or tinny.  Playing feel is fairly smooth for round-wound strings and they last for ages.  This is a good intermediate gauge: light enough for lead work. but substantial enough to provide good backing.Guitarists tend to stay loyal to a maker and model of string.  My loyalty is certainly not shaken.  For any guitarist on another string whose loyalty might be wavering. these will reward an audition."
5,"I've been playing guitar for more than 20 years. I've played 6 strings. 12 strings. bass acoustics and electrics. When it comes to acoustic sound. these strings produce the brightest. clearest sound of any string I've ever used. Some strings have a 'bright' sound and some have a clear. distinct tone - not muted or dull. Still. other strings have a rich. full resonance that carries through a room. This is the only string I've ever used that has all of those qualities. In fact. the first time I put these on my acoustic and went to lead worship at my church. several of the church members commented that my guitar sounded 'better than usual' or 'really good' that day. I've tried some other brands since I found these and always end up coming back to them."
5,"These guitar strings sound about the same after a month of playing as they do right after I change them. I use to get a real kick out of changing strings because the new strings sounded so much different and better. but now the thrill is gone because these strings sound good for a couple of months although I change once a month anyway. I don't notice much difference at all though.But the best part is that these strings are over $17 bucks a set at my local music store and I get 'em for about $9.48 through Amazon's subscription service delivered to my mailbox every month with free shipping! Beat that!"
5,"One doesn't get much better than D'Addario strings.  In my opinion they're twice as clear as Martin strings and the EXPs just last forever.  I like the standard Phosphor Bronze just as well and use those as a less-expensive alternative.I certainly recommend D'Addario nylon strings on classical guitars.  I've heard no other string that has the crisp. clean. rich sound of this brand of strings.  I've used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand... but always come back to this one.Different diameter strings will sound significantly different. depending on the guitar you use.  I prefer this mid-range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone.  Any lighter and the guitar sounds 'tinny'. any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck.  These are 'just right'."
5,"I bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips.  I check the guitar in baggage with this case and it seems to protect it just fine.  the it is very good for a Stratocaster and there is a little extra room inside for tuner. picks. tuning forks. capo. etc.  and..........the price was very good.  best I could find for this time of hard case.  The only thing that is sort of weird is that most employees at the airport are constantly asking me if I have a gun in case.  If you need basic protection of your guitar. this will do very well.  I do not know if it will fit other guitars.  I have heard that some are too long for it.  but.......for the Fender stat. it works just great."
5,"I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. One was in the SKB Fender case ($99.95 on Amazon). the other in this Gator case purchased locally.  I was told it was just as good as the Fender case. Both ended up in checked luggage.  After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop. minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up.  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case.  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape. but after having the padding fall out. I just ordered another SKB Fender case.  The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips.  The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on."
5,"Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars.  The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar. and while the back support wouldn't scratch a guitar anyway. it's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate.  These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low.  This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked.  The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands. but overall this is excellent - I've replaced all my stands with these."
5,"I don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing. but they need to go back to engineering school. When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position. they're quite difficult to pop open. and once opened into place. you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off. because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.It'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place. and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. I just don't like the features of this stand at all."
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
5,"After trying out a few other styles and brands. I settled on this stand. wanting something that would keep my 50s Telecaster from taking an unexpected fall. The overall design of the stand is great. but I had to return my first stand. as there were severe quality issues with the finish. There were at least 3 spots where the black finish didn't stick to the metal. and I essentially had bare metal spots sticking out. The neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about 15 degrees to the right. once it was clamped down to the main stand body. Disappointingly. the replacement unit I received also has this issue. but only about 7-10 degrees worth. I'm going to use this stand in the meantime while I try to find something of a nicer finish. and truly worthy of my guitar."
5,"This is a good stand that can be used for both electric and acoustic guitars. The upper brace has an interesting way of securing the guitar neck making it unlikely your instrument will topple over. The stand can be used with or without the upper brace. On mine. the wheel that locks the upper brace in place is not as locking as I'd like it to be. Also. the &#34;feet&#34; don't spread as wide apart as I'd hoped. A few more inches would have been appreciated. All in all. a good but not &#34;perfect&#34; stand."
5,"I've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  This one is the worst.  The plastic screw (yes. plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to. is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.Secondly. there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6' pop filter.  If you don't. you'll wish you did."
5,"You may wat to reconsider buying ANY filter.On this model. the top (filter) part is essentially pantyhose wrapped around a cardboard tube.Despite this. the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good.In all honesty. Buy a nicer filter. or none at all. They do NOT make a huge difference on recording quality unless you're using Top-of-the-line microphones. If this is the case. spend the money to get a nicer filter.One nice thing- these keep artists from getting too close to the mic and essentially making out with them. I found that quality nice when dealing with... passionate vocalists."
5,"Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says 'Heavy Duty' which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip. but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly. and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead."
5,"I can't do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer (FOX).  If you haven't started in the mic-collecting business. trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below. you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one.  I've always wondered why I can't reproduce the sounds of our local NPR outlet. and I finally realize it's because they have the Shure SM7B and I don't.It enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives (face it. those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use).  It's very directional and 'selective' (rejecting room ambience and background noise). so it's perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications.  But for announcing. broadcasting. vocal performance and vocal recording. I don't see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it."
5,"I bought this compression pedal to give my leads a little extra oomph and it does just that. When playing hammer-ons and pull-offs. sometimes it can be difficult to get them to sound as loud as the rest of your picking. but not when using this pedal. It amplifies your quieter sounds and levels off the louder ones to give a smoothe sound. Works great if used correctly. Not to be used with dynamic picking sounds because you will lose that louder/softer sound.I use this with a Gibson Les Paul. and Washburn Hollowbody through a Fender Super Champ amp along with other pedals.  It can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion."
5,"I bought this pedal at a local shop and use it with both guitar and Bass. I usually put it before a distortion pedal and my original Phase 90. or use it as a standalone with an old amplifier to even out the signal. I do notice it is more effective with the guitar than bass. but that is typical. I usually do not turn the compression knob past 12 o'clock. but when using a chain of pedals. the compressor helps even out the lows and highs. The pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also. For the price. it seems like the best economical choice for compressor pedal out there and the MXR pedals are built like tanks. I have had this one and the Bass model for years and they hold up great while showing their age well."
5,"Its OK. the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank. i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can't complain about it not being worth what i paid for it. i currently have this on my pedal board along with a Digitech MainSqueeze which is less expensive. more adjustable and just more versatile. would i buy this. yes if i didn't try anything else first. nuff said."
5,"This is a great cymbal stand sturdy. tight. well made. using it with a 18&#34; crash and does not move or rattle. amazingly well constructed stand for the price. going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these. great product. I am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all. but it is a great stand for my studio/practice kit. Being honest don't know how it would be for a gigging drummer. but for what I am using it for. more than does the job."
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
5,"I have found this throne to be comfortable for studio use and it seems to be solid enough for everyday use.  It is sturdy and heavy enough for the average player and the price is definitely right.  The padding is just about right and feels good and comfortable for the session times for which I have used it.  I don't know how it would hold up for touring or constant use. but it is perfect for my needs. as I am a guitarist who plays drums for demos in the studio."
5,"This pedal works well. and lets you sculpt a pleasing sound to suit the situation.  A little goes a long way with the sliders. and the gain and level functions are occasionally useful.  Nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq.  It makes it much easier to dial in the exact sound you want. easier than messing with eq knobs that can interact with each other.Ten bands is a little overkill for guitar.  Three of them are outside the range of the instrument. but I bought this one because I like that it blinks if clipping. it has the extra volume and gain sliders. and comes with the AC adaptor.  This adds no noise that I can tell. except if the sliders are up it amplifies noise already there.It's an all around quality product that I imagine I'll still have twenty years from now."
5,"I ran across this thing a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  I'd been looking for a boom attachment for a non-boom stand because I play guitar and sing.  This seemed perfect. and it is.  Regular booms have always been a necessary evil. in my book.  They can be helpful. but also take up too much 'air space' on cramped stages or in small rehearsal spaces.  This thing gives you plenty of room to get the stand out of the way without making an annoyance of itself.  The other thing I like is that the elbow where it adjusts has teeth that interlock. so you're not just tightening a joint and relying on friction - as those are the kind of things that eventually fail once the tightening bolt gets tired.Anyway - no reservations about this one.  A dead-simple idea that works great."
5,"This is a tough unit. easy to set and locks tight.  The materials are robust.In a home studio there is never a lot of room and I didn't want a big boom hanging off the other side of my mic stand.  This fit the bill perfectly.  On the package there is an illustration of this being used at the end of a long boom to hang a mic in the perfect possition. and yeah. one could totally do that with this.This is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
5,"Well built.  The adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about 8 or 9 degree increments.  (10 possible positions between upright and horizontal)  Best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck. I'm using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the  stand to give  me a bit more room.  But there is no counter-weight here so its best used at shallow angles.  If I was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar. or if on-stage energy has you moving a lot more. I would opt for a boom stand instead."
5,"One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldn't handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly.  I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didn't have much to lose with a $7 price tag.  I was very glad I made the purchase and I'm going to order a couple more of this model and the 13' model.  It's steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place.  It's solidly built and I don't imagine it will break easily.  The two pieces that move against each other have teeth. so once the angle is set and the knob tightened. it will not slip.  Get the 13' if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand.  7' is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length."
5,"One thing I love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hi-hat stands. I use anOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneckto connect to the bar. then I attach either aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphoneor DM80 microphone. The bar-gooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model.This also works well for mounting on microphone stands. I use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the DM70 for tenor and alto saxophones. or a DM80 for baritones. Again. it works perfectly for my situations.I always keep a few of these. plus various size goosenecks. just in case I need to mount an additional microphone and I am short on stands. It's one more tool to make set up less stressful.Trust me. when you need one (and chances are you will if you're a drummer or a sound tech) you will thank yourself for having the foresight to purchase it for situations I cited above and those that I have not foreseen."
5,"Haven't had this long. but so far. it's just about perfect. I had bought another On-Stage side boom earlier and was greatly disappointed by its flimsiness (On-Stage MY550 - see review). This one on the other hand is rock solid and much more adjustable. AND only costs a few bucks more (fourteen buckos at present). I've got a 13' gooseneck and a light-ish condenser mic with a shock-mount on it. and it's as steady as can be. I'm convinced even heavier loads will be no problem. If you're in need of a side boom. look no further."
5,"Think it sounds like a trash can lid? No. it doesn't. It sounds like a crappy china which has it's place (in the rehersal studio for one...). Want a really good china? Spend more money. That's how it works. Great for practicing. Small diameter gives it a shrill overtone. Poor on recordings (unless you're looking for that... there's always an application). For $20 though. c'mon. What do you want? Anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad. It's $20. It was made in the remote hills of Wuhan China where they've been making cymbals of sorts for more than 3.500 years and you got one for $20. Or go buy a K Kustum and quit your sniveling. I say get one! get them all in all sizes and you still spent less than an actual professional china. boyah."
5,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal. the knobs feel sturdy. and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good. cheap choice. Personally. I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800.Joyo Vintage Overdrive.Deltalab TO-1.TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated. I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808. you may want to check this out first."
5,"I've had this pedal for about five years.  I own a bunch of other overdrive pedals. including the Boss SD-1. TS-9. a Klon clone. and a bunch of DIY pedals.  The Bad Monkey is cool for a couple of reasons.  First is the bass and treble controls.  Most overdrive pedals only have one tone control. the Bad Monkey lets you sculpt both the highs and lows.  Second is the mixer out.  Not everyone will appreciate this feature but it allows you to jack the pedal into a mixer or audio interface with a 'speaker sim'.The gain sound is ok. but what I do is use it as a boost by diming the output and turning the gain all the way down which slams my tube amp giving me a natural tube overdrive.  This pedal will work best with a tube amp but some people may dig the gain tone on a solid state.It's built like a tank.  Can't go wrong for the price. IMO."
5,"I love this pedal. I bought one used at GC the other day for $30 and never looked back. Before it I was using a Joyo Vintage OD that is also an excellent 808 Clone but this pedal is able to tweak the highs and lows better. I have it set so the level is set to 9:00. Low is set to 1:00. High is set to 9:00 and the Gain is set to next tuesday. I prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that. It also is a nice smooth OD not too crunchy.For a cheap 808 clone this is the best I have used hands down.Maxon 808 - $150Ibanez TS9 - $100Digitech Bad Monkey - $60Joyo Vintage OD - $50All great pedals for the money but not really sold that the Maxon is 2 1/2 times better."
5,"While I don't have a ton of experience with pedals. I really love this one. Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain. Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp. It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for. a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity. For the price I don't see how you can beat this pedal. I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome. No complaints with this outfit."
5,"I've tried to like this pedal. I really have.  Maybe it's my signal chain (?)  My experience with the DigiTech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar.  Sure. the OD is there. but it isn't worth losing your tone. is it?  Again. I reiterate maybe it's just me.  I have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now.  And the blue pedal isn't any different. either IMO.  Grunge was OK. but not my kind of style."
5,"Price:Very reasonable price for what they do.Comfort:These stay on your head very well and are comfortable. I have not noticed ear irritation yet.Noise reduction:These are absolutely stellar at noise reduction. These block so much sound. you no longer have to blast your music to hear over your drums. They also don't distort out side sound. Some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly.Sound quality:Crisp mid and high range. When it comes to the low end. these are lacking. And if you blast your music the low end distorts. But they block sound so well you don't have to blast them.Why not just buy in ear head phones. and over ear muffs?I have tried this many times due to not being able to find good head phones. It is very annoying. doesn't work very well. and looks pretty dumb too. These head phones are a much better solution."
5,"I got these for noise reduction. barking dogs. loud trucks etc. They work well for that. The only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head. After a time the pinch is bit much. I have a small (7-1/4) hat size too. However. the price was great. and the sound is good. I'm no audiophile. but do play guitar. mando and dulcimer. and for me these phones deliver a good. well rounded sound.One other thing. these headphones are made for the studio. not for outdoor use.So. if you can deal with the pinch. I highly recommend these headphones for noise reduction and sound quality."
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
5,"After going to various guitar/music stores and trying out many guitars (Yamaha.Ibanez. Fender and others) I researched on the internet and stumbled upon this make/model and saw the MANY positive reviews it had. I was reluctant to purchase an instrument without playing it first. so I purchased the best sounding guitar locally (costing me $129). After 1 day I realized I was unhappy with it still and took a chance and purchased this guitar online. The many reviews were absolutely correct. THIS guitar is wonderful and sounds great. I replaced the strings yet the original strings were just as good as the LIGHT strings I bought. Even though it is only an $89 guitar. I will treasure this one as if it was $300. Perfect intonation all the way up to the octave. Low action and stays in tune for days!"
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"This is a great guitar for the money. I paid $69.34 for my guitar and bought it through Amazon.com from Streamline Audio Video. It arrived ahead of schedule in great shape. ready to play right out of the box (after tuning it of course). If you want a better guitar than this. you will need to spend a whole lot more. The sound is great and it is easy to play. Only about 41&#34; long and may weigh a bit over the 6 lbs. stated in the description. My strings arrived is fine condition and the action was very close to what I will need."
5,"I didn't know what to expect given the price. but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money. I am impressed by the quality of materials. components. and construction. For example. the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed; they work smoothly. and firmly hold the strings in tune. The instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box; the action didn't seem inordinately high. but I couldn't resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so. and now the guitar plays even better. I might tinker some more at some point. probably when it comes time to replace the strings. but for now I am quite happy with the playability and sound of this full-bodied dreadnought. which is rich and resonant and very impressive. I still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price. but the proof is indisputably before me."
5,"I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter.  She is learning to play guitar and the classical guitar I gave her was just too wide for her little fingers to reach.  The action on this guitar is perfect and required no set up..was ready to go out of the box.  I almost kept it for myself as a knock around guitar it is that nice.  I have been playing for about 30 years and was really impressed with the quality of this guitar and the sweet. full. rich sound.  If you are looking at this guitar. buy it!  You will not be disappointed!"
5,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made. which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said. they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig. but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So. I recommend them. but be aware of its limitations."
5,"I had a Cannon brand clutch and I bought this one to replace it. What I like about this one is how the release lever works. On the Cannon the lever was vertical. This made actuating it a less natural motion. With this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases. That motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use. An argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but I have had no issue with it.Aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well."
5,"Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right. but now it works great.The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing. After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played.Height adjustment was also important. If the latch is to high. it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up. Too low and it does not sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs. so I am completely pleased with it.definitely worth $13.00"
5,"I've been interested in learning how to play the guitar for a long time. but the huge problem for me was finding something that was both affordable and made for smaller hands. as I'm rather petite.  Luckily for me. we found one of these secondhand (it needed minimal repairs)and it's just great.  I don't know anything about purchasing it new. but I can tell you that this is a great beginner's instrument for someone who has small hands.  I'll also note that it's even affordable while it's brand new.The notes are surprisingly clean-sounding coming from a guitar that's so low-priced. I'd definitely recommend this guitar to anyone who is interested in learning how to play but not interested enough to pay an arm and a leg for an instrument."
5,"The build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced (the cut is a rush job) and the neck needs to be reset (there's a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn't completely cleaned out when it was put on) - but what do you expect for this price. It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you're willing to invest another $50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a.young (smaller) player or a.nice travel instrument."
5,"Very playable right out of the Box and very beautiful. I have a Epiphone Swingster. Nighthawk and Violin Bass and they are all great products! I decided to give it a good set up. After the Strings were off I sanded down the Bridge 1-2 mm and adjusted the neck just a little. Then I want to really recommend Martin Bronze Strings light or extra light (green box) for an awesome sound and easy playability which is important on 12 Strings. Instructional videos can be viewed on YouTube before you go for it or you get a Guitar Tech to do it.Ps Matching Epiphone cases are available and so are inexpensive clip on pickups if you want to go thru an Amp or line in recording.Ps The Tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion. When you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner."
5,"If you're looking for a 12-string acoustic. then what more could you want than the Epiphone DR-212?  The craftsmanship is excellent. the sound is fantastic and it's easy to tune and play right out of the box.  Add the limited lifetime warranty and Gibson support and this guitar can't be beat.  The price is amazing for what you get. and to top this all off. it has been chosen as a Guitar Players Magazine Editors Pick.  You don't have this guitar?  What are you waiting for?  Order it now while the price is this low!  Go ahead! Go for it!  You won't be sorry..."
5,"I have an older version of this model. but it works great.  I opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that I got from Home depot.  2 hangers rated to hold up to 75 lbs each equals 150 lbs worth of peace of mind!  The hanger itself that I bought was used. so it was already assembled. so I can't comment too much on the assembly process.  I bought 2 of them. and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry-free security!  And no. I don't own stock in the company!  :-)"
5,"I actually have five of these for the various instruments. mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solid-body electric.When mounted properly to studs - the only way I have mounted these - they are very. very solid. While in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners. I used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength. You do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete. and to me a brass screw looks great with this &#34;flat black&#34; model.The CC11 model -- this one -- works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic. There are variants for other instruments. but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit. The yoke width is adjustable. and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder.Recommended...but do consider you means of mounting carefully."
5,"Easy to mount. solid grip on guitar. Only detractor would be that. with my guitar at least. it hangs kind of far from the wall. This obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though. An acoustic would clear the wall nicely. my solid body electric sits a few inches away from the wall.Silicone coating on forks and retaining bands get a good grip on the guitar. without marring even soft wood.I very much prefer this to having it on one of the 'accident waiting to happen' stands on the floor."
5,"The mounting process was simple.Recommendation:  Buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don't already have one.  You don't want your instrument plummeting to the floor!I got a stud finder off Amazon and mounted two of these hangers.  They're holding up very well. The backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall.  Whether that's a good thing...is up to you.  I guess I don't have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped.  So maybe it is a good thing.Be careful when you hang it though.  It could definitely hit the wall if you don't place it on the hanger carefully."
5,"Wanted to buy a better stand than the cheap metal folding one that I'd had in high school.  This was a great compromise between portability/storage and sturdiness.  I did want collapsible legs. which this has. and the solid coated metal shelf is wonderful after my old metal folding stand.  Works well with the Manhasset second shelf accessory. and has been in constant use for months now.  I've had absolutely no problems with it.  The height is easily adjustable. and the shelf tilt is easy too.  Am very happy with what I got for the price I paid!"
5,"CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again"
5,"These strings are okay. but nothing special except for the price. which is a factor when changing twice a week. I don't play enough to need changes that often anymore.So I've become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar. This doesn't mean that these strings are bad. it just means I might prefer Brand X Pure Nickel on one guitar because they're darker and Brand Y Steels on another because they're brighter and Brand Z on yet another.So give these a try and if you prefer them it will be best to check on price by the case of this or any string that you prefer because they should be changed twice a month at least. if you want your instrument in top shape. A bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good."
5,"Hey jerks. do you play guitar?  Well. if you do. you need strings.  Well. you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar.  If so. you can stop reading.  If you use strings. you should buy them your damn self.  While you're at it. buy ten sets.  Seriously. are you a child?  Always have extra strings.  D'Addarios last a long time for me. and they sound good.  Also. they're on the bottom end of the price range.  Buy some strings. douchnozzle."
5,"Keeping in mind the difference types of guitars and pickups. these D'Addario strings are good strings for all around use. They are suitable for rock. punk. country. and funk. Sure. you could spend more on 'boutique' specialty strings to give you that exact 'vintage' sound. but these strings are just fine whether you play in the bedroom. garage or club.I like the light guage .010's because they are easy on the fingers. but are still beefy sounding compared to thin sounding .009's and .008's."
5,"I have played on D'addario Before.  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok.  but can wear out real fast.  So. It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks. pinched hormonic's vibrato's. extreme bend's.  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings.I did try extra light (while they do soud nice.and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's.  cause beginer's tend to press hard. when they first stat out.Personally.  I don't like D'addario's at all.  I find the tone to bright."
5,"Not much to say. these are your basic hex core. nickel plated round wound strings.  They are the equivalent ofErnie Ball Slinkys (Yellow)They play nice. and feel pretty much the same in my humble (non-touring musician's) opinion.Also. it's nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer.  As a note these come packed together in a single bag. with color coded washers. (as opposed to the EB sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or DR sets that come two to a sleeve.)In summary. if you're searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren't reading this review. you're out experimenting.  For others. the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more."
5,"I've been playing for nearly ten years and I've used all sorts of strings on many different guitars. I've had ball ends pop off for no reason. ball ends rolling around in the bottoms of containers when I've bought them new. and a lot of unnecessary string breakage and fast corrosion. (all top brands) I have also overpaid for fancy gimmicks on strings that are supposed give you magic tones ect. Then I tried D'addario. they just work and work well. I'm not asking for anything magical I just need what I need when I need it and these string have never failed to deliver. I've been using them for over three years now I don't know why I didn't give them a shot sooner. I could have saved a lot of money trying them first. Bottom line is these strings do the job without any drama. giving me more time to just play!"
5,"This is my second order of the 10 pack. A local store wants 29.99 for one set of these. The feel is really good in my opinion as opposed to all the other brands I've tried; including. and especially the most commonly used eb's. I have however had a slight issue with certain D strings. On occasion. it looks as if the winding is chipping off. but not at the frets. I change strings quite often so it really doesn't matter. Not sure what that's about but it doesn't affect anything and like I said this IS my second order of these so I gave them 5 stars. Any less and I'd look dumb."
5,"For a good. basic set of regular light gauge electric guitar strings. it's difficult to go wrong with D'Addario's EXL110s.  The range of thicknesses generally works well. and D'Addarios tend to be pretty consistent.  Some other brands may offer special features that go beyond what you get with the EXL110s (e.g. coating. super brightness. and so on). and some players prefer a slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string (e.g. sets that start with 9s or 11s). but for most purposes these work great. hold their tuning well. and seem to last pretty well. too."
5,"The D'Addario sets are good stuff. I got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker. The color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran. With stretching. they stay in tune fine. The unknown truth about non-nylon strings (and maybe even them. too) is that there are only a handful of string makers. and D'Addario actually makes them for other companies (Gore uses them for their Elixir series. and just adds the polyweb coating). I also use the GHS standard .010 sets. and they are good too. My faves are the Ernie Ball sets. but they rarely go on sale. I don't remember who makes what strings for what companies. though. With offshore production a standard thing now. it's no telling where they actually come from anyways. I DOUBT that GFS strings are domestic production. for instance."
5,"These strings are good. Nice tone. last a decent amount of time. and they're cheap. Color coded ball-ends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention. I use these on all my electric guitars now. where before I used Dean Markley 11-52 (mostly Les Paul scale) - I moved to these when I got a strat-scale guitar. I don't remember why I picked these. other than they are cheap and readily available everywhere. where Dean Markley can be hit or miss."
5,"These strings aren't for everyone. and probably not what you want for everyday. normal playing. But if you're looking for a fast-playing string with a bright sound. this is the string. In addition to putting them on my guitar. I also have a six-string banjo (guitar tuning) and just couldn't get the sound I wanted from regular guitar strings. Light guage nickel strings were recommended to me. and they were exactly what I was looking for. They have a clear. bright sound that great for picking and strumming. I play a lot of bluegrass and Irish music. and I feel these strings are ideal for that purpose. I use a lot of D'Addario strings on my various instruments. and I think they offer the most bang-for-the-buck in terms of quality and tone. You can pay more. but I don't think you get that much more. Although these were intended for electric guitar. they also work well on resonator guitars."
5,"D'Addario Are The Best Strings That I Have Tried. I Used To Use Ernie Ball Super Slinky's But Found That These Last Longer. The Ernie's Bend and Play Well But They Tend To  Go Dull Faster Not To Mention The Ernie's Start Corroding Within A Week. These D'Addario Strings Stay Brighter Longer. I Usually Change Them About Every 4 Weeks. The Ernie's Only Last Me A Week. 2 Weeks At The Most. That Can Get Expensive Fast. All Around The D'Addario Strings Are The Strings 4 Me. Retraction. when I originally wrote this review I thought they were the best. Turns out they are in fact way better than Ernie Ball Strings. but they are no longer my preference. A friend of mine told me about DR strings and they are much better than these D'Addarios. DR's last three times as long as D'Addario. the DR's cost a lil more but they are way better. for the money Addarios are good but I would recommend spending a few dollars more for DR strings"
5,"To be clear: I am quite the newbie guitar player.After i managed to break a string on my electric guitar. i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself. as most guitarists do. Things went alright. but on trying to tune the thinnest string. it broke. I just figured it was something I did. and wasn't the products fault. so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine. Overall. i've played quite abit with these strings. and have yet to break another one. Pretty good sound quality. and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture-resistant package to prevent corrosion."
5,"These D'Addario  strings are great!  I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using. these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life.  Intonation is good and I've noticed less breakage as well.These strings are a bit bright but have plenty of 'good' sparkle too and really sound good on my Strat. even more so than my Sheraton.  Being from the 'old school' I still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper. but what can ya do? Besides that. I am totally stoked and happy with these.  I think I might try 9's on the Sheraton but even as is they play (and sound) very good."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
5,"If you're a Froosh fan like me. than look no further. These are the strings used by John Frusciante (formerly of the Red Hot Chili Peppers). These strings really are special. They help nail his tone and are slick. light. feel and handle bends perfectly. I use these on my 1962 Strat Reissue and they really compliment the stratocaster well. Highly recommended for those playing blues/funk/rock.Plus. I mean. come on. John mother *&%$#$% Frusciante uses them! :p"
5,"I have been a faithful user of D'Addario strings since a well meaning obsession-starter recommended them to me at a local music store.  Compared to other brands of nickel strings that I've used. these ones just feel 'cleaner' than the others. They have a clearer sound. and seem to hold their tune better than most.If you're looking for acoustic strings. you can't beat the phosphorus bronze for warmth and clarity.  But if you're looking for electrics that are reasonably priced and sound clean. look no further."
5,"As stated. I use the D'Addario 9s and 10s on all my electric guitars except for theGibson LP's and I use Brite wires on those.I like the D'Addario's over the Brite wires because they have color coded balls and thismakes changing out all the strings at once a lot easier.I do not produce a lot of body acid. so strings last a very long time with me. no matterwho the manufacturer is. and I play many guitars in my collection so none of them gets heavyuse.The EXL strings produce great tone. and are great for bending."
5,"I've been playing for 8 years and I own 4 electric guitars.  All of my guitars are strung with D'Addario 10's.  They sound great when they're fresh and in my opinion they stay fresh the longest.  I play at least 15-20 hours per week so I put a decent amount of wear and tear on my strings.  It's really the durability that sets these apart.The Amazon price is terrific.  I like to restring my main guitar a little bit more than once a month and I can buy a year's worth of these for the same price as 1 set of bass strings.  I'd definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through Amazon."
5,"I have an Epiphone Dot and I installed a Bigsby V5 on it.  I could not find a gig bag for semi hollow body guitar so settled on this one due to the price.  And a previous reviewer said his Dot with Bigsby fits.  Well it fits. but just barely.  The guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case.  I have to turn the arm of the Bigsby around. facing down. to close the case.  I think the case probably pushes the arm down a little bit even in this position.  I probably wouldn't store my guitar in this case for long periods cuz I'd worry about tension on the strings.  Otherwise I like it."
5,"The shell and the lining of the case are perfect: hard on the outside. and soft on the inside.I opened up the box and my Epiphone Dot slid right in.The only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap. and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen.I'm not traveling around with my guitar too much. so that's not a problem for me. but I would worry a bit if I were checking it on an airline.Otherwise. it works perfectly for what I bought it for - protecting it in my mancave / basement from dings and scratches."
5,"I got this for my Epi Sheraton II:PROS:  It fits perfectly; it's 'fur' lined and has a decent sized internal compartment; it's solid and the hardware is sturdy; it has one locking latch (out of five). but nothing that would stop a real thief; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over. two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side. and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground; it's relatively thin.CONS:  It's heavy; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle; it has some 'Made in China' characteristics.I've had several cases and this is one of the nicest.  On a personal level. I'd prefer it didn't say 'Epiphone' on the outside.  But since it does it's a good place to hide a $3000 Gibson 335."
5,"The M48 is well built. sturdy and well balanced enough that I have no concerns about tipping. even when it is loaded with several music books and a folder of sheet music. The tray is wide with an appropriately sized lip. and is moveable up and down with a moderate effort. Once in place it stays there with no slipping. For all of the solid construction it does not feel heavy and it is easy to move around. although it would be a little awkward to transport it in a small car.This is one of those purchases where there are a number of alternatives. and I always have some concern that it will not be what I want when I get it... in this case it is a winner. Delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
5,"I'll keep this short and simple. I do alot of radio work. and saw the price of this mic of eBay (I wanted to use Paypal) and got it. 60 bucks for something I'd have easily have paid 100+ for. and with the included shockmount. it's a total steal. This obviously won't match top quality condensers. but for speech atleast. I find it to have a wonderful crisp tone with a warm sound to compliment your voice. It just has that smooth radio sound you hear on stations like NPR. which I just love. It sounds fantastic and with a proper interface. possibly the best condenser I've tested that's under 150 bucks."
5,"I love this product. It came fast. included extra shockmount line. shockmount. an adapter. the mic. instructions. and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting. The sound quality is great with the Art Tube Preamp(use mic cables. not 1/4' cables for Phantom Power). and I couldn't be happier with it. It even looks impressive. Although. I do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny. when in reality it is this 'off-silver' color. Almost a gold. but not quite. It's not bad or anything. just different. And frankly. the thing could be purple for all I care- as long as it produces great sound. that's all that matters. Great product. and extremely affordable. No complaints."
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
5,"I have a few Planet Waves products and I can safely recommend them.  This is no different. it works. I have no issues with the product. if you are looking for a peg winder.  or any accessory. I'd recommend you look at Planet Waves among your research in brands.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
5,"I picked up one of these at Guitar Center a while back.  At first. it seemed unstable. but then I tried to open it up a little more. and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here.  When it's opened up all the way. it is relatively stable. and is suitable for servicing your own guitar.  As others say. it does fold up nicely. and takes up minimal space in my toolbox.  I wouldn't use this if I made a living servicing guitars. as I don't think it would last long due to the quality of materials (it does feel pretty cheap.)  But it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while.I imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt.  Over all. I'm happy with the purchase. as it suits my needs."
5,"I do all my own guitar maintenance. which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings. etc.  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose. but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench.  So. looking around on Amazon. I found this handy little device.  It's small. works well. and fairly inexpensive.  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust.  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction.  But don't get me wrong. it's still pretty strong... just don't put too much weight on it while using it."
5,"This little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work. It folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases. The rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table. It may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you're not careful. Sure. a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose. but what else would you spend the $10 on?"
5,"I started playing mandolin back in September and bought a lot of different picks to try to find the type that would work best for my playing. and finally decided on the Dunlop Jazz Stubby 3.00mm picks.  Once I determined that it was the best pick for me it was an easy decision to buy a package of them so that I won't ever be without one.  Picks have a habit of disappearing just when you need them most -- buying them in bulk this way means that I'll always have them available and can even share them with others if the opportunity arises."
5,"Works great for my acoustic dreadnought.If I had any complaint it would be that there's nothing to prevent the lower part of the guitar from banging against the wall. It would be nice if they had an option for something that could hang down off the hanger - a little cushion - that would go between the wall and the guitar. No reason I can't make something like that on my own. though.Edit - 9/24/2013 - Just got my first classical guitar and realized that the wider neck won't fit into this hanger. Nothing worth complaining about. but just something to note - if you need a hanger for a classical guitar. this isn't it."
5,"This is a really nice item and I got two of them.  Unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and I had to force it which has created a little wobble.  That's the problem with mail order. Sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it. Oh well so far its working OK with the my old classical (beater) guitar I have hanging on the faulty one.  The other unit seems to be rock solid. Oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar."
5,"This Guitar Hanger is good looking. well made. and was exactly what we were looking for to hang my son's acoustic guitar on the wall in his room. Our logic was that having it hanging in plain sight would be much more conducive to him practicing over having it hidden in case stuffed in a closet. and so far that seems to be the case.The hanger was easy to install (literally took less than 5 minutes to screw into the wall) and is easy to use (just place guitar in the padded holder by the neck).Highly Recommended!CFH"
5,"Works great.  I didn't use the monster size wall board screw and it holds fine with the small furnished screws.  Next time I'm buying the all metal one and daisy chaining them to a board so I don't have to make tons of holes in the wall for my half dozen guitars.  For now I'm hanging one on the wall with this and it's fine.  Wood is nice quality.  I notice the price is almost 2x as much if you walk in the guitar center."
5,"Many reviews cover the pro's of this item. so I'll be short only to add that they are very sturdy (when install properly...suggestion:  find a wall stud and use 3' screws for heavier instruments).Used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 Strat's.  Haven't had an issue with any in the 4-5 months we've had them up.  On the electrics. we use the section of the bracket between the wall and the hook to hang the coiled guitar cable.The hooks are bendable and can adjust or adapt to virtually any style head and are grippy enough to keep slick finishes from slipping.Wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free."
5,"Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas. but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks. depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance. I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood. really - to support the instrument from the bottom. The top hanger now just serves as a rest. but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward."
5,"With musical instruments standing about on my office floor. I determined to find a better way to keep them available. and so I decided to hang them on the walls. This hanger was very easy to install. It comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to drywall itself. or through drywall and into wall studs. I used the pre-drilled holes as a template to mark my wall and the hanger went in easily. But a word of warning: use a level to align the hanger to a vertical position on your wall. If you don't. your guitar will hang a bit cock-eyed."
5,"I have 7 guitars in my cramped little bedroom studio and I quickly ran out of space to hold them easily. Floor space is dominated by my desk and drum set and I wanted my guitars to be out of the way and safe so they didn't get tripped over or dinged. Enter the String swing.I have 7 of them and I have hung everything from a Fender bass to a takamine acoustic with no trouble.The Y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a Stratocaster. Just slip your headstock into it and the weight of the guitar finds it's own center of gravity.The base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory. I didn't use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs.These are well worth the cost."
5,"This is a lovely wall mount for your guitar. Comes with everything you need (except a drill or a screwdriver of course). It is pretty and very strong. I originally purchased it to hang on drywall (sheetrock) for my 5 year old's mini guitar but once I had it mounted I found that it is strong enough to hold MY ELECTRIC guitar. which is quite heavy and that is amazing to me because usually that kind of weight would pull a mount right out of the sheetrock. This is a good buy."
5,"I have 10 of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars. banjos. and mandolins.They attach to the wall with 2 screws.  Hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall.  It takes about a 1/4 inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic.The piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone/rubber which protects the instrument.  The holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have.I have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again.Very sturdy. well made product."
5,"I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did. I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick. its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement. I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on."
5,"This is an OK solution to keeping your picks handy and organized; at least you can have one place where you can find a pick. as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case. but a small baggie will work just as well. Maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage? Sometimes (depending on the amount and size of the pick) it's hard to get the pick out of the holder. and if you use something other than the standard shape. forget it.  It has an adhesive backing. so I guess you can stick it on your amp/guitar/wall/small animal. but I'd rather not."
5,"This Dunlop 'Ergo Pickholder' is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy. especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick. you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.RecommendedCFH"
5,"I love this little item.  I was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new Fender but I love it.  No more hunting for picks anymore.  When I am through playing a just slide my pick back into the holder and it's always there when I pick up the guitar.Placement is everything though so think it out before you just stick in on your guitar.  I placed mine where I'd never rub against it. between the amp cord inlet and a control knob.  Make sure it isn't in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against it.I love this and have one coming for my acoustic too. only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitar.Oh. I use medium picks and fit 7 easily into the holder and wouldn't try to squeeze another on in. but that's why you have a gig bag anyway.  This is a must have item. in my opinion."
5,"It didn't seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless. It may work well with Dunlop picks but not for thePlanet Waves 10 Standard Guitar Picks - Duralin Blue ###GT!!! Medium/Heavy. also the thicker the pick. the fewer it will hold. It has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot. I've found it mostly not useful thus far. maybe it would help more when playing live so I can grab for a pick and know they will be there."
5,"I hated having to put the pick between strings.  And now that I have a ton of picks. I can convientently put them in this little thing that attaches to the guitar.  Im still weary of putting it on my guitar because it has a matte finish. and I dont want to ruin it.  But the instructions say it should be fine.  I think I might put it on my amplifier instead because having it on the guitar might get in the way as well. still deciding on that.  But for the price you pay for this. it's a no brainer for any musician."
5,"I can't compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder I use. I have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar I own. And every student I've ever had. has one on their guitar as well. They are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding. They stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time. they can be easily removed and relocated. After relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location. I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others. No matter how many picks you store. or for how long. the spring action loader never loses its resistance. I highly recommend these. I personally will never even try any others as I am so pleased with this product. If you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks. this is the product for you."
5,"The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument."
5,"A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I've never had cause to remove it. At first I thought I'd hate the look of it there. but it's never bothered me one bit. Reaching for pics is never a problem. I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics. This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal."
5,"I've used several different kinds of guitar cables. and I've finally settled on planet waves cables. From patch cables to guitar cables. I simply trust this company. In most cases the difference between guitar cables is the same difference between an iPhone and an Android. there really isn't one - it simply comes down to user prefrence. So in that regard. I prefer planet waves cables. I snagged this cable so I had the one right angle for my pedal board and the other end for my guitar. Highly recommended!"
5,"Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats. and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality. since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10'. 1/4' mono (tip)"
5,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive. yet lightweight. flexible. and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness. which feels nice at first and feels 'more studio.' but when you're actually using the cable. it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance. Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more. I prefer Pro Co Excellines. since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler. just call Sweetwater). which feels nicer to me. but I like these just fine."
5,"I got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is NO CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world....after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course . since this cord is molded/sealed up tight . it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead..."
5,"I've used so many guitar cables over the years that I lost count. It's hard to find a tough. low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere. but this one is the best one out there for the price paid. Its made well. with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that I love. I use it for all of my equipment connections. and it simply works with no problems and no noise that I could detect. Try it out. you'll discover the same as me and my band mate's have. that this is the best cable for the money on Amazon!"
5,"I haven't measured signal throughput so I can't comment on that.  But where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle.  This thing simply will not crimp. will not kink up on itself. does not get twisted and has no tension in it.  It's the easiest handling cable I've ever dealt with. a real pleasure when you've got all kinds of wires running all over.  It's like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy. and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connections.I have a 10-footer with one right-angle connection. and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a Telecaster."
5,"Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks.  Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago.  Last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. Messed around a bit and it started to work.  Today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp.  Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy.  Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either.  At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $12 cord.Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I'd return it.  Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund.  Will just move on to another company's cord."
5,"I was originally was about to purchase a cheaper. thinner cable. but settled on this Planet Waves Classic series XLR cable. I wanted myMXL 2010 Multi-pattern Studio Micto have a quality xlr cable connecting it. I also have my microphone and this cable connected to theYamaha Audiogram 6 audio interfaceand it works flawlessly.* Sturdy cable. IT is thick and flexible at the same time. It curls around my microphone stand well. too.* Good connector heads. At the female end (microphone). there is spring part that locks in the microphone in. NIce added peace of mind.This cable simply feels strong and well made. Phantom power and data transfer has been flawless. I highly recommend this quality XLR cable.Update: 12.19.12Still working great after 5 months. Forgot to mention the nice packaging. It's eco friendly and nicely packaged. It also has a lifetime GUARANTEE. Not a warranty. a guarantee! That speaks volumes on the quality they believe on their product."
5,"These picks seem well made and have a solid feel. but I'm not sure I like the sound of them.  Like so many other guitarists. I go through a lot of picks. searching for what feels and sounds the best for what I do.  I don't this is it for me--at least not on acoustic.  Whatever I didn't like about them got drowned out when I tried electric.  Since I've been playing more acoustic lately. I might or might not buy these again."
5,"Dava picks are one of life's guilty little pleasures. They may seem pricey for picks. but they're still not that expensive. I bought this batch of picks when I realized my Davas from three years back were all gone.I use these to play slide. I also have Fender and Musician's Friend picks. but those are just the standard flat stamped-out pieces of plastic. The Davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control. And they just plain feel good to use. The other picks have more of a tendency to slip and slide. but with Dava you get a great grip."
5,"I usually use Dunlop big stubby 2.0 picks. I used the Master Control Pick for the first time today. and I just had to order two more. because they're so amazing!! The attack is second to none!! At first the pick felt a bit strange as I'm accustomed to the thicker Dunlop. and I have to admit that initially I was a bit weary of the notably thinner Dava; but in no way has my playing been hindered. if anything it just seems to run along the strings effortlessly. and by far these are the most comfortable picks I've ever used!! What a find!!UPDATE 6/6/14:Still the best pick I've ever played. If you're worried about the metal tip of the pick breaking or weakening the strings. don't worry. they won't (at least not from what I've seen). Also. pinch harmonics are the easiest thing in the world to play with these picks!"
5,"I bought two of these straps from a local store for thirty bucks each about two years ago. They've been the best straps; along with the same straps without the grommets. that I've used. I figured I'd save a bit and get a couple more from Amazon. I got them fast and saved twenty bucks. They do fine with my fairly heavy Fender and St Blues guitars as well as my P bass. They are middle of the road for price and width. but give me no comfort issues at all. My second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets. Super tight and easy to lower. Raising it is a different story though. I just save the fast &#34;lower played&#34; songs for last. Those are the best ones anyway. Excellent strap."
5,"This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first. it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)"
5,"nice sturdy construction for the most part. although I don't like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends. But for the price. you get what you pay for. I would have much better liked it if they were metal. I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good. but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead. The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar. so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position. the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back. I'll give it a try for a while. but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare."
5,"I bought this for an accousic guitar. then I had to have one for a mandolin. and now I also have one for a square-neck dobro.  Some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don't leave much room for a leather strap.  Some case manufacturers have the same problem.  This item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it. that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job.  Same with the mandolin. if you want a wider strap. The dobro had the issue with the strap didn't have a great connector."
5,"If you're a bass player and use a pick. you need one of these. If you are a bass player and *sometimes* use a pick. you *really* need one of these! I bought one for every bass and a spare.Wedgies work better on bass than guitar. because the strings are thicker and usually parallel. I have a guitar wedgie on my gibson explorer. and it is a bit loose because of the angled headstock spreading the strings--but the bass ones stay put.Really. these things are great."
5,"After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more. I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way. if a longer unit is needed. I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware. very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front. using an SM 57. and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy."
5,"I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)"
5,"I use this when myOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck. Blackare too long for what I want to do. Sometimes - on rare occasions - I have used this to extend the length of the 13' model.The mic I mainly use this with is aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphone. which is small. relatively light. and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals. When I am using that mic for alto and tenor sax. I use anOn Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment Barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand. and attach the gooseneck and DM70 without using a separate mic stand.Because this and its bigger sibling are so versatile I keep a few of each size around. plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars. In some situations they can be a savior during set up.  I will empahsize. though. that anything larger than the DM70 or DM80 (which is slightly larger and heavier). and this may not hold your mic in place."
5,"I have several MXR pedals. Every one is superb--except for this PHASE 90 (the non-'script' version reviewed here). This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean. for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion. a swoosh of sonic dirt. I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (Look up 'MXR Phase 90 Mods.' and 'Erik's Corner' will show you how.) I made the 'R28.' 'C11.' and 'C12' modifications. The result: a slightly improved phaser. one that still churned out plenty of distortion. Finally. I tried adjusting the internal trim pot. On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. No luck. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESN'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION. AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90."
5,"I do not have much to say about this. It does what it was designed to do and it looks fine.I found myself actually trying to see if it will rip. for the purposes of this review. Just so I could make some sort of comment about it... You can rip it if you try. but it's not likely to happen during everyday use.It's fairly thick. If that isn't what you want then I would look elsewhere. This should be fine for nearly everyone who doesn't have a very specific reason for a different sort of windscreen."
5,"At first I thought this would be a gimmick. but it was cheap so I figured what the hell. Once I had it. however. I realized how invaluable it was. When performing live. I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic. Once I got this little guy though. I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times. Volume remains constant. white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear. It also protected my mic in a fall once too. Can find anything better for this cheap."
5,"These are by far the best value for effects pedal cables.  I find the local music stores won't stock them. forcing you to buy higher quality cables at about $7.00 each.  These cables. so far. have done the job at a fraction of the price.  We will see how well they stand up over the long-term as they are a cheaper cable.  But for the price. they are great.  At 6 per pack. you can even afford to simply replace them as they go bad and still be ahead -- if that even happens."
5,"Bought this on a whim.  It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion.  When used with a pedalboard rig. it doesn't add much except for hiss. unfortunately.  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit. though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment. Line 6 equipment. Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar. amp. wah. and guitar. or amp. wah. guitar. and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out. though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player. but good for beginners and intermediate levels.  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling."
5,"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz. distorions. auto wah. a compressor. octaver. bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to 'recuperate' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity. definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"
5,"I have had several MXR pedals through the years ... I have always found their quality to be very good for the price ... in fact. some of their pedals exceed the competitors' products for less than half the price ... (to each his own and certainly there are higher levels of quality out there but just because it is priced more doesn't mean it is that much better)If you need a little tone sweetener. this pedal can deliver ... with flatter EQ's it is fairly noiseless ... but as with all EQ's. if you boost certain frequencies pretty high. you will get some noise ...Simple to use and I particularly like the lighted LEDs for each band ... this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage ...As with all MXR pedals. it is built solid and road-rugged ...For the price. this is a nice pedal. simple to use and built to last"
5,"I didn't want to spend too much $$ for a guitar that I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. There were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price. They were good quality and if this didn't work out then I would have probably gone that route. To my surprise. this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar. The only downfall was that the frets were sharp on the one side of the guitar. The local shop only charged me $5 to shave them down. I replaced the strings right away. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it. Definitely worth the price you pay."
5,"This guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well. I am now a fan of Takamine. Their is nothing bad I can say about this guitar and I would take this guitar anywhere. This is my 4th guitar I have bought and is by far my favorite guitar. I have 2 electric guitars and now 2 acoustic. this being the second acoustic. I wanted a cheap guitar I could take anywhere and not have to worry about it being scratched up. except I got the guitar and looks too nice to let get beat up. People are complaining about the guitar not having a glossy finish. It wasn't supposed to be glossy to give it a richer look. If this guitar was glossy it wouldn't be as nice sounds stupid but it is true. You have to see the guitar face to face to understand what I mean. This guitar I would recommend to anyone. I am trying to get my friends to buy one so can all have a acoustic guitar. lol. Thank You!!!!!!"
5,"I don't own one. but have been playing my sister-in-law's for the last year when visiting. Didn't know much about the guitar. but was quite impressed by the sound and workmanship. Changed the strings. and. other than the action being a little high. it's as good as anything I've played for under $500. I honestly thought it cost around $350. so I was quite surprised seeing it for sale for less than $100. It's definitely a great value.In part because of my experience with this guitar. I purchased a Takamine G Series 12-string last year. (for considerably more money). and it's simply incredible."
5,"I bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon. I wasn't planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar. The way the military palletizes all of its cargo. I figured there was about a fifty percent chance it would arrive in a flattened box with wooden splinters sticking out of it. but I took the chance anyway. It arrived intact. and ready to play. The strings are a bit cheap. but the guitar itself is well made. and has a really nice rich tone. I was planning on giving it away when I left. but I am shipping it home instead. and it wioll cost me almost the price of the guitar to mail it home. but it is worth it. This one has worked out so well I am taking a chance on a 12 string. soon to arrive in Theater."
5,"I got tired of flying with my guitar everytime I go visit my parents.  Besides the risk to my guitar. there is the cost.  For the price I paid for this guitar. I will be money ahead in two visits to my parents.  I had it shipped to my parents when I bought it. and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits.  It has much better tone than I expected. and very good action.  Stays in tune very well.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party."
5,"well.. First of all. I am a beginner.. I do not know anything about guitar... I saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets... Mine came yesterday and I am afraid that it would have issue. so I brought it to school and let my professor checked for me.. It surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all.. The string does not corroded. but I changed mine anyway. The fret does not have any issue at all.. and the Truss rod adjustment is perfect.. The action is low and the guitar structure is perfect. When my professor starts playing it. he was surprised by the sound it produced. He thought the guitar cost $300 above!!... He also bought one this morning...haha...anyways. I buy it from amazon and the packaging is great!!...My guitar comes in a perfect condition. and I strongly recommended this guitar for anybody!!..."
5,"I tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars.  Therefore. after playing. I always wipe down my strings to extend their life.  I've used other microfiber cloths. but they tend to break easy and leave 'fuzzies' on the strings. which I then have to remove one by one.  This cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use.  It is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use.  I liked my first one so much. that I am putting in another order."
5,"Purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me. This cloth cleans up pretty well. but what i noticed after wiping down the strings a few times is that the fibers would hook. I dunno if they weren't meant to wipe the strings with but my ernie ball cloth is A LOT more durable than this cloth. They do the job but i believe that the ernie ball cloth does it better. Like a previous reviewer. i'm a little iffy about putting this cloth in the washer.Update: Putting it in the watcher was fine and idk why but after washing it for the first time it cleans up 1000000x better than before. i like this and my ernie ball cloth :)From 3 to 5 starts!!"
5,"I bought my first one from Amazon over a month ago - and simply fell in love with it.  It cleans/polishes wood. metal (although for strings. I use GHS' Fast Fret). eye-glasses. computer screens. etc with wonderful ability. easily replacing 'casual' cleaning/polishing fluids.  I even recently bought a 2nd just because.  And yes. the first one has finally gone through the wash after a month of constant use- I knew it was time when it wasn't wiping off the smudges as quickly.  It came out with a slightly nappy texture (to be expected really). but still works as well as ever.  There is a vast amount of different 'polish' cloth brands out there. but you won't go wrong with this one."
5,"We've all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job. When I see the word microfiber I always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck.This cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing I've tried before. With no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it.This would be great for Any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions.Reasonably priced too."
5,"This is a great-sounding reverb pedal. Tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound. I've combined this with a Epiphone Sheraton II (semi-hollow body) and have been able to get some awesome deep. rich sounds (watch out for feedback though). The design is very solid. and the controls are quite easy to use. Honestly. I think it has a lot of reverb settings that I won't use very much. but there's no problem with them being there.I definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of Kings of Leon. U2. etc. Or if you're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones. this is it. This has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar. My only caveat to this review is that I haven't tried out other reverb pedals. but this one definitely suits all my needs."
5,"As soon as I got this pedal I put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum. I have a 2 Behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals.but my pedal board was silent till I put this pedal on it. I've only had it for a few days. but the cons out way the pros. Maybe I will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit. Once I get around to playing with it I will write another review."
5,"I've been a gigging musician for almost 20 years. and this is the most well made. most comfortable guitar/bass strap I've ever used.Pros:- Substantial padding where you need it- Perfect stitching- Heavy. stiff leather ends- Soft. fine-woven material - not the coarse nylon you find in most cheap straps- Underside is lined with an even softer material - makes the strap comfortable even without a shirt on- Did I mention it's super comfortable?Cons:- None to speak of.  Seriously.  It's that phenomenal.Perfect whether you're rocking a featherweight Strat or a 16-pound 6-string bass.I use it with a 13-pound 5-string Warwick bass. and it makes it feel like the bass is a part of me.  I hardly notice I'm actually wearing it.Combine this strap with a decent set of strap locks. and it could easily last you 10 years.You will not be sorry with this purchase."
5,"Bought one. tried it on a P-bass. loved it.  Returned to Amazon and bought an additional one for a Jazz Bass...love it.  Good product for a good price. very comfortable.  Update:  I just ordered my 3rd one of these. this time for another P-bass I picked up.  The only gripe I can think of (and it's being super picky) is as another review mentioned the strap's padding design doesn't really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position.  If you're a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap. other than that. this is a killer product for a killer price."
5,"It's not fancy. but it's well though out. and you can't beat the value. The edges don't cut your neck. and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want. Like others. I had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment. The foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want. and it flexible/thin enough to go through the buckles if needed. Excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass."
5,"If you need it. good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap.  Leather or simulated. this was quite adequate for my purposes.  Price was right! Delivery was immediate.  Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case.  This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument. since it comes in at least two distinct color tones.Planet Waves Mandolin Strap. Brown.  Also comes in Black. There is also an embossed model (Brown) offered at minimumly higher price."
5,"isn't it sad when somebody produces a great product but screws up on the description? The product is great value for money and worth while buying. if for no other reason than save money on overpriced DC power units from the manufacturers of the pedal units. Trouble is that they do not say whether or not the cables come with the unit. They don't!! Dumb of them. as all they needed to say  was you needed to buy them separately. which I later did. Seems like nit picking? Well. it's not as live abroad and these things take a long while to come down to me. Sloppy isn't it?"
5,"It works great for five of my lower power pedal type items. including my Line 6 wireless receivers. Shure wireless receivers. and several other pedals like my Cry Baby. etc.. all at once.  However. the transmitter for my Shure wireless in-ear monitor. which requires less power than any of the other two items combined. will not run. even by itself. when powered by the 1 Spot.  Switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own. and there is probably some little quirk in the Shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn't get along with.  For most of my stuff it works great. and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords."
5,"I use this One Spot Adapter with the 5 pedal attachment. Works perfectly! I've seen reviews about this brand being noisy. I suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version. Too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle.I've owned it for a couple of months. used it at home 5 days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times. Zero hum or buzz from the unit. I should also mention that I do not have any drive/distortion pedals on my board."
5,"At the begining I wasn't sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this. so I decided to buy it and I started having problems right of the box. I notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals. then I started to play with them and realized that I had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain. so I decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used 4 with my pedals and surprise!. connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine. I also realized that pedals positions (routing signal) has something to do with it. I couldn't figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right. so I would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it. so it work as it is supposed to."
5,"This is the answer to your all your power supply needs. If you own more than 1 pedal (and we all do) You need this. It powers my Wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug. It comes with all the different power plug options and a daisy chain for 5 pedals. It has the adapters to power pedals without a place to plug in by attaching the battery snap to the battery place on the pedal then pluging into the daisychain. It also has the pin plugs to attach to the daisychain for pedals that require that kind of plug in. and it has a 10 foot lead wire so you can reach out to your pedals or pedalboard without having to drag a heavy extension cord across the stage to trip on while your playing. you'll save enough money to pay for it in no time. not having to buy batteries. Get it. you'll love it! I"
5,"I use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals.I don't use this on my pedal board and don't know if I would recommend it for heavy live use. I suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here.It does work well and will power many pedals at one time. I do not use it for powering only one pedal though. This device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals.I also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet.Easy to use - it is what it is."
5,"Arrived on time ... works as intended and maybe more.One day. I was pondering how best to de-clutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various 9V-12V DC equipment on my table or rack. Fortunately. I chanced upon this little gem and in an instant ... my problem was solved. I chose the 12V adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary 12V DC source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack. I also bought another similar unit form another source here on Amazon and used that to supply the 9V DC source to power the rest of the units that needed a 9V source. Everything worked fine and I relegated the remaining adapters to storage. Been working without a problem to this day."
5,"Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board. this was a logical choice of power. The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs. combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board. There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak. Further. with the transformer being well away from the board. there is zero AC hum. What's not to like here?"
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
5,"One Spots come with an 8-pedal multi plug. If you only have 4 pedals. or lets say you have 12. powering them with an 8 plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly. The left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they aren't plugged into pedals. Using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces. alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs. Very nice quality. just as with all one spot stuff. Great price. great purchase."
5,"If you're buying this and new to effects pedals (like I was). you'll be concerned whether it'll work with the inexpensive pedals you're likely to also be buying. especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you'll need them. The two most common types of inexpensive pedals are Danelectro and Behringer. and if you're like me they're ll you'll buy for quite a while. The good news is. you do NOT need to buy converters for them. This little beauty will run all your Behringer and Danelectro pedals. off from any of the standard 9V power supplies available (you don't NEED to buy a 1SPOT. I use it with a Behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less-expensive Planet Wave if you're working on an even tighter budget. In short. buy this product. it will save you its cost in 9V batteries within the first two months if you're on low-price pedals."
5,"This product isn't really one to review but it does what it advertises. I use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my TU-3 (great tuner by the way). Starting to build my pedal board so I figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a T-Rex fuel tank. which I'm planing on in the future. Great adapter for all of your pedals. decent quality. and only ten bucks. Can't beat it!"
5,"I bought this set mainly because I wanted a cheap micro-fiber cloth to polish off my guitars.  For the price of just a microfiber cloth. this set throws in a polish.The cloth is just what I wanted. It is soft and I feel good rubbing it on my instrument. I wish there were a little pouch that came with it so you can keep it separate -- mine is right now in a ziploc bag in my basement with my other loose gear.  The polish is just that -- it is works to bring out a shine. but it is not a cleaner.  You also have to be careful about where on your instrument you get the polish; there is a bit of wax in there and it is not string-friendly."
5,"The Product Itself Is Good. Shined My Guitar Up Nicely. The Cloth I Received Was A Black Microfiber Cloth With The Ernie Ball Logo. I Must Say That The Cloth Is Very Nice. It's Soft And Lint Free. So The Cloth Alone Was Worth Purchasing This Polish. After The Polish Is Gone I Will Probably Try Another Product. I Need Something That Will Conceal The Fine Scratches On My Guitar Finish. Probably Like A Guitar Wax. But All In All This Product Seems Good For Wiping Down The Guitar After Playing. Keeps The Instrument Nice And Shiny. It Removes Smudges And Fingerprints Quite Nicely. Not A Bad Product. It Arrived Within A Couple Of Days. I Am Satisfied With This Purchase"
5,"I recently bought this (May 2011) to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine.PROS:  Non-oily. water-like consistency; leaves no residue behind;  slight non-chemical odor that doesn't linger on your guitar; removes smudges. fingerprints. etc. and leaves a nice shine; comes with a large lint- and dust-free. fast-drying cloth (black); less expensive than most other guitar polishes.CONS:  The pump sprays in a very wide area. so be careful to avoid spraying strings. pickups. etc.The polish in the bottle works well and the lint-free cloth works well too.  I can't see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine."
5,"I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken. but I didn't want any down time. so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time. and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine. I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar. it falls almost immediately out of place again. So. I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed. unlike this brand new bad cable."
5,"Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty.I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement...no problems whatsoever.For the price you are paying (about $1 dollar per foot) you get good quality cable. good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends.Not the best. but not the worst. Good enough for live stage gigging and probably won't notice much difference if you are recording.I haven't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables.They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where. cable owner. etc.Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a 'feel good' purchase.I would recommend these cables and will buy again."
5,"Super low capacitance- on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from Mogami. Canare. etc. The connectors are fantastic and they come with Planet Waves' super-handy elastic cord wrap. These are outstanding guitar cables at a VERY good price. I used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors. but with these. I don't see the point. The lifetime exchange warranty also makes the DIY repair thing kind of pointless too (of course Amazon's return policy is still 30 days. so be aware of that- you'd need to mail it back to the MFR or take it to another dealer to exchange - that is if you ever had to)."
5,"been using these cables for three months now. I use them with aZoom G1N Guitar Multi Effects Pedaland they sound great. decided to get this one over the cheaper ones because after doing a little online research I found out that these are suppuosed to take abuse and hold their own better over time. they have a good lenght. of course this being taken in consideration what type of venues you'll be playing. so far I've only used them in rehearsal studios but will be using them live for the first time in a couple of halloween gig I've got coming up the end of the month."
5,"I have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my Mogami Gold cables.  If you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound. this might not be the cable for you.HOWEVER. for the price and purpose this a five star cable.  The plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection. but also feel sturdy and secure.  The gold plating ensures a solid connection.What I like most about this cable is that it's guaranteed for life and I can bring it to a Planet Waves authorized dealer for a replacement... or so their packaging claims.  I have not had to replace mine."
5,"I read a lot of positive reviews on the 9.5s and after some use. I am kind of disappointed.CONSTRUCTION:They are just like any other strings. just lighter gaugePACKAGING:It arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionPRICE:At $4.99 new with free 2 day shipping. this is a no brainer.CONCLUSION:I initially liked the feel of these strings. but the more I played the more I realized that it didnt have the tone I was looking for. I am used to 10s and 11s and though they are more difficult to bend with. they sound much fuller. I put these on my latest stratocaster build and have since replaced them with 10s."
5,"I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George. I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set."
5,"These strings are best suited for Strats if you want to keep those easy to bend leads but have a little bit more tone. They're also quite good on Les Paul style guitars if you like slinky strings. My issue with them is that the B string and the A string are a bit unbalanced with respect to the others. I would prefer if the B string were 0.012 instead of 0.0115 and if the A were 0.032 instead of 0.034. As such. I prefer to buy the strings individually and customize my own set that way. But if you're not too picky. this will suit you very well."
5,"I'm normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever.  It was used. and the strings were dismal sounding. so I bought these D'Addario EXLs.  They hold pitch beautifully.  My only complaint has to do with my guitar technique. not the strings.  Having used heavier strings forever on my acoustic guitars. the recommended lighter gauge recommended for the electric don't like my 'heavy-handed' approach to pressing down the strings.  As a result. the highly bendable lighter strings become sharp up near the nut until I relax and enjoy playing with a very light touch.  It will take some getting used to -- or else I'll simply move to heavier strings and leave the lighter ones to lead guitarists who know what they are doing.  All of that said. the strings are pure joy to play."
5,"I've used D'Addario's on so many different Guitar's the only opinion I can honestly give Ya is that They are the best. In the Studio or on Stage. They stay in tune and work very well with any pickup You are using. I put these on My Wife's Bass cause She is still learning and with a Fender Squire it sounds almost as good as a Precision Fender Bass. They stay true to the note so She will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time......"
5,"Best articulate bass string for the money.  I have one of the first versions of the Fender Precision Lyte bass from the 90s.  I have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued.  They sound great and stay in tune.  Sound like Rotosounds.....think Roger Glover. Geddy Lee. and Chris Squier.  Nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick.  I am not a slap style player so I can't comment on that.  I set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible. Try them. you'll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy."
5,"I use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars. except for the smaller Takamine New Yorker and A&L; Ami (I use the D'Addario custom lights).  I have grown a fondness for the Phosphor Bronze strings because of the perfect balance between the warm full sound with strumming and bright tones when picking.  ALso. the brightness is retained longer than other bronze and brass alloys I've tried. such as Martins and Elixirs.  These strings are quite durable and long-lasting.  In the 10 years I've been playing. I've never had these strings break on me (I've broken Martin and Elixir strings in the past).  The color-coded end balls help with the restringing.  I typically get the three-pack so I can restring a trio set of my herd at a time.  I really can't complain about anything.The individual gauges are: .012. .016. .024w. .032w. .042w. .053wHighly recommended."
5,"My guitar originally came with D'Addrio exp and they sounded good. I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good. but the finish was wearing fast. This time I got a 3 pack of EJ16-3d light. The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.But the sound is the problem. It's terrible. They sound very muddy. Crisp tone distinction is just not there. I thought light would be the better route. but now I'm not sure. I purchased some others to try. Also. since a purchased a 3 pack. I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings."
5,"These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull. and I absolutely love their sound. feel. and durability. The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast. The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes. these strings have a great. uplifting sound to them. hard to soft strums. Playing feels great with them. nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel. clean and smooth. When replacing. I ran into no problems. quick and easy. I love the strings and their price. definitely will stick with this brand as well."
5,"These strings from D'Addario are a personal favorite of mine. I love the EJ16 light gauge for their size and ease of use. I think the light gauge is a nice size that won't hurt your fingers. or put undue stress on your guitar. Not only that. but they sound great. Not too big or not too small! I have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass. I love how they color code their strings on the 'ball ends'. To me this makes it much easier when changing strings. You don't have to worry about mixing up your strings. I've also had no problem with the fit; unlike some brands. Give these a try. I think you'll be satisfied."
5,"I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar. and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S. and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break. I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all. I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and 'stretch' for few days playing. it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months. they still are playable. and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings."
5,"Low end made in China dreadnaught acoustic - Bristol - actually sounds somewhat fantastic in terms of low end resonance and sparkling high end.Here's what I've found. The way you string the guitar makes a difference. With practice I've become more proficient.Curve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate. Not just a simple bend but kind of bend them over my thumb so they can sort of catch before inserting the bridge pin. Then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm.I use a locking pattern on the tuning pegs and keep the string quite tight so it loops tightly around the peg.Then I use a microfiber cloth and wipe down each string after each time playing. - use my little finger to hook the cloth under each string and wipe down each length.Try to practice for about an hour daily. The tone as I say is pretty darn good. Played a high end adirondack. rosewood. name brand and was disappointed that it didn't sound that much better to me."
5,"Got the 3 pack and oh what a great difference on me. my guitar. and my sound.I'm a 62 YO newby to guitar!! This proves that easy helps. I have a big baby Taylor and when i needed new strings I went to the wrong place. got Martins installed -- wow did they make a (bad)diference to me.  Sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play. My friend said that he uses D'Addario and that they make ALL the difference in the world!! Tried them and he was right.  I changed my own (on the big Baby) and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position (instead of switching the E and B string like the dealer did!) MY Taylor recommends Elixr. but the D'Addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the Taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers!!"
5,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time. in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound. even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge. D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green. the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory). the high E is silver. and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great. but the first few times. it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string. hands down. after almost 40 years of playing."
5,"This brand has never disappointed me. regardless of the diameter of the strings. To me they just sound complete. Even the light strings don't sound tinny. which amazed me compared to other big names. They complement my Washburns very well. Though they are not top of the line models. I often get compliments like &#34;you're guitars must be expensive judging from the sound alone&#34;. But it's been a trial & error for me. I found that my Washburns sound better with this brand at least as far as my own ears are concerned."
5,"Always buy D'Addario strings for my 7 guitars.  Those strings stay tuned longer and will last me a little longer than others I have tried and believe me when I say that I tried many other types.  They have a great rating from other musicians. ....and the price is very affordable.  Highly recommended by this writer.  It is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings....it is a bit like discussing our likes in food. musicians. movies....etc.  We all have our likes and dislikes.....For my taste D'Addario EJ16-3D is usually the strings I drift back to whenever I buy strings.  I like their full sound and their lasting tones."
5,"I'm going to be honest. I have a cheap guitar. I payed $120 for an Epiphone at my local music store because I just play it recreationally. (Bonfires. sitting around the house. etc..) So I've never really put a nice set of strings on it because I figured strings aren't really going to make THAT much of a sound difference on this guitar. but I was way way way wrong! These strings aren't even that expensive. actually they're only a few more dollars than the usual cheap strings I put on my guitar. Yet. they completely  changed the sound of my guitar and it sounds like I forked over some money for a decent guitar! The strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips! I used to play once or twice a week. but I can't help but want to play every single day just to hear these things sing!"
5,"I bought these primarily because they are so cheap. The quality is good I would say - not great. but not terrible either. They sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull. They don't last nearly as long as Elixirs. but then again. they are a lot cheaper than Elixirs. I would recommend these for practice - no gigging with these as the sound isn't quite as crisp as I would think a performer would want. For the price though. it's hard to knock on them too much."
5,"I have restored an old REX Commander.  Yeah. I know;  never heard of it.  Beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck.  Frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing.  But the resonance of the D'Addario's really bring this old guitar to life with a thick juicy vibrance on the bass side. and bell like clarity on the treble side.  Not to mention how great they look.  The snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me.  Terrific strings for the price of cheapies."
5,"I needed to replace the strings on my acoustic. and chose these D'Addario's based on price and the favorable reviews given them by other users. I'm glad I chose them. as they play easily and have a nice sound. The lighter gauge allows for rapid yet sure fingering. and makes 'bending' notes for a blues effect a cinch. In fact. I occasionally have to remind myself there's no longer any need to press down nearly as hard as I previously had to when playing the heavier-gauge strings my guitar came with. In short. these strings make playing so much more enjoyable. I wish I'd gotten them from the start. But then. without the comparison of playing with the old strings. I might not appreciate playing with these half as much as I do now."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
5,"Tried D'Adario EJ36 Extra Light 12-string set on my Eko Ranger XII 12-string acoustic. and the EJ11 Light 6-string set on my Takamine.  No trouble stringing or tuning either set.  With the 0.012-0.53 Light weight strings I tuned a full note lower than normal to ease string tension. and they still sound fine.  Good acoustic. but a rather strong metalic. sound with a nice 'ring'. and notably more metalic than the EJ15 Phosphor Bronze strings.  Sound does deaden over time. as expected. but I especially noticed deadening on the high E and B non-wound strings. losing some of their 'ring'.  (Tried Elixir's for better longevity. but they did not sound as good to me as these D'Adario's.)"
5,"First time I ordered these was in a larger order. and Amazon forgot to put them in the box. Oops! I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you. Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately. so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze. but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these. and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it. I like their tone. and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time."
5,"Sound can be subjective and strings are a matter of debate that can go on forever.  Usually I wouldn't notice a significant difference between brands (except for any coated string that all sound like crap to my ears) but when I put D'addarios on my 000 I just couldn't believe the improvement over the Martins.  It took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear.  These consistently sound the most balanced and responsive... With the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else.I'm glad the search is over for awhile and I have a solid sweet baseline to experiment from here!"
5,"The mandolin arrived on time and came in a box within a box where the mandolin was wrapped. There was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke. I tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songs.I removed the pick guard because I really didn't like how it looked and it looks fine without it. The strings that come with it work fine and none snapped. Even if you end up not wanting to play it. you can always hang it somewhere because it looks nicer than I would have expected. The only problem I have is that the two G chords do not fit completely in the nut but i have heard that you can adjust it so it fits properly. I got this because I really enjoy the sound of a mandolin and the price is amazingly cheap. Also. another difficulty I had was that the tailpiece comes off easier than it goes back on. If you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out."
5,"Addario strings are ok.. Although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder... Aquila seems to be the most popular now. I have used both and I am satisfied with both...I play the soprano. concert. tenor. and baritone. Each one different in it on right...Also play the the concert scale banjolele.. Only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only IMHO.  Be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times:))))"
5,"First off. I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert. however. reading up on this. they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said. it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke. but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also. I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these."
5,"I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar. and will soon replace them.  On quality control. the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it. two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected. but it looks bad.  On sound. these seemed okay at first. but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week. especially the high B and E steel strings. which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck. more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball."
5,"As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out. you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two. even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in. but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up. but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far. they are great. Definitely recommended!"
5,"If you expect to get what you pay for. prepare to be disappointed. Sounds weak. Sounds old. Sounds worn. Sounds dull. I wanted to experience a new brand on my Stratocaster. I can afford to pay twice as much. But I am going to keep using my D'adario Strings from now on. I am so disappointed. These strings are for the &#34;campfire guitarist&#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling. tapping. pull offs. or sweepers. If you are a tone fanatic keep looking. If your guitar deserves the best. do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. Respect your GUITAR.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are made from China."
5,"I just had a guitar setup with DR Pure Blues 9's and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff.I've also noticed a bit of what I must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so.It almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as 'black' as the oxidation I've seen from low-quality strings.They also seem to have more 'string squeak' when changing chords than other brands - even after generously spritzing them withFingerease Guitar String LubricantI am not qualified to say if they truly give you that 'vintage tone' but they do sound decent.However. for $6 I would rather getDean Markley Blue Steel LT 2552 Electric Guitar Strings (.009-.042)or save some money and go withD'Addario EXL120 Electric Guitar Strings. Super Light. 9-42.EvenErnie Ball Super Slinky String Set (9 - 42)seem to feel better to me. but I am a Da-Dairy-O man. for now."
5,"I read good reviews about these strings on mylespaul.com and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price. I usually use DR Tite Fits. but these made me change for good They have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with P90's. I also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar I built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup. I will buy another set. DR strings never disappoint."

11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."

I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.'

There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."

I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."

Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."

Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."

4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"

It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance.

Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.

The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."

3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws.

I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more.

2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."

I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."

Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."

Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."

4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"

It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance.

Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.

The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."

3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws.

I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more.

2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."

I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."

Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."

Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."

4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"

It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance.

Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.

The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."

3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws.

I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more.

2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."

I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."

Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."

Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."

4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"

It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance.

Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.

The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."

3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws.

I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more.

2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."

I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."

Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."

Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."

4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"

It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance.

Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.

The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."

3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws.

I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more.

2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."

I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."

Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."

Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."

4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"

It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance.

Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.

The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."

3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws.

I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more.

2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."

I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."

Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."

Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."

4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"

It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance.

Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.

The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."

3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws.

I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more.

2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."

I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"

As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."

I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."

Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."

I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."

Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
7,"Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools. I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills. so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now. I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close. or that the tool holder would fall off. Well. it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum. since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use. your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)"
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
1,"I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning. but then around week 3. it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend. who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months. I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said. it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy. and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus. I think a little of the coloring has gone down. but it is hard to tell."
5,"I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW."
6,"1.  This is a very nice looking. well designed product.  It's simply to assemble. it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last. but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
12,"This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game.it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do.then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red.Blue.Yellow.Silver.Gold.Cristel.FireRed.LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh.they stink."
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment.
